 Social media is a paradise and it can take anyone to a scene of paradise. If I put something interesting on social networking site, even if my account is unknown, it reaches the whole world. If it&#8217;s a good item, it will revolve the universe and at the same time, if it&#8217;s bad, you are multiplying your sins. Mufti Menk reminds us about the usage and bad usage of social networking sites and applications. Now a days there are a number of platforms available for chatting and communication. Whether it&#8217;s Viber, Whatsapp, Facebook, Telegram or whatever, we have to keep a good deal in communication. In the current scenario of information super highway, it&#8217;s very easy to dig up your chat or communication history. Whenever you use your mobile or other social accounts, use it for a drop of goodness, use it for making a good friendship and use it for a moral cherishing activity. Then only the almighty, Allah can take care of you and to lead you to a powerful future.
