Sheikh Navaid Aziz, well known speaker on Islamic knowledge and thoughts delivered a wonderful speech on ‘The Accepted Dua’ or the accepted prayer.

The almighty and compassionate Allah is the ultimate to provide you the solution for your doubts, troubles, struggles and thoughts. He can help you in every state of life if you keep good prayer and faith in him. He has told a story of first Dua that a couples done for their infant at hospital that the infant was struggling for survival due to severe blood clotting in brain. After their first Dua to Allah, Allah showed his miracle on the baby. The baby was totally cured and she is alive in this universe with all her physical and mental abilities. So the moral of this story is that we must pray to God for most compassionate and moral things, not for personal profits.
