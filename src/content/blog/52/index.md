**The Importance of Ramadan and Fasting**   
Fasting in the month of Ramadan is one of the five pillars that form the basis of Islam. These pillars lay the foundations of a believer and a Muslim must adhere to them with devotion. Fasting during the month of Ramadan is compulsory, as prescribed by Allah in The Holy Qur’an:

*“Ramadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed as a guide for humanity with clear proofs of guidance and the standard ˹to distinguish between right and wrong˺. So whoever is present this month, let them fast. But whoever is ill or on a journey, then ˹let them fast˺ an equal number of days ˹after Ramadan˺. Allah intends ease for you, not hardship, so that you may complete the prescribed period and proclaim the greatness of Allah for guiding you, and perhaps you will be grateful.”* 
(Al-Quran 2:185)

The importance of the month of Ramadan and virtues of fasting are described in numerous ahadith, or sayings of the beloved Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). They highlight the blessed month's merits and rewards, within the traditions of prophet Muhammad (PBUH) related to fasting.

**When to start fasting**

Narrated by Ibn Umar: *I heard Allah's Apostle (PBUH) saying, "When you see the crescent (of the month of Ramadan), start fasting, and when you see the crescent (of the month of Shawwal), stop fasting; and if the sky is overcast (and you can't see It) then regard the crescent (month) of Ramadan (as of 30 days)."*
Sahih Al-Bukhari Volume 3, Book 30, Hadith 1901

**Refraining leads to reward from Allah (SWT)**

Narrated by Abu Huraira: *Allah's Apostle (PBUH) said, "Fasting is a shield (or a screen or a shelter).

The Prophet added, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, the smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the smell of musk. (Allah says about the fasting person), 'He has left his food, drink and desires for My sake. The fast is for Me. So I will reward (the fasting person) for it and the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times."*
Sahih Al-Bukhari Volume 3, Book 30, Hadith 1895

The Prophet used to recite the Holy Qur'an to Gabriel, and when Gabriel met him, he used to be more generous than a fast wind (which causes rain and welfare).*
