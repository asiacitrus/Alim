 Our parents, elders, and teachers have greatly emphasized from our early childhood to start all our activities by saying Bismillah Ar-Rahmani Ar-Raheem. What does this phrase really mean? Most, if not all of us have been explained its meaning also as, “In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful and the Most Compassionate”. When we say “Bismillahi Ar-Rahmani Ar-Raheem”, we are asking Allah’s help which may be different for different people. We want Allah to cure us when we are sick, to enlighten us when we are confused, to feed us when we are hungry, to energize us when we are tired and so on. Allah, the Exalted has different names representing His different attributes like: Al-Hadi, the one who guides; Al-Razzak, the one who provides; As-Salam, the one who delivers peace; and so on. The scholars of Islam have described ninety-nine attributes (names) of Allah, SWT and all of us don’t know all His attributes. Allah, SWT, has honored us with His two beautiful attributes from among the ninety-nine, which HE loves and wants us to remember at every step of our lives. These are AR-RAHMAN and AR-RAHEEM, which when expressed as “Bismillahi Ar-Rahmani Ar-Raheem” embraces all the attributes of Allah (SWT). By saying these words, we are committing and expressing our love for Him (SWT). Simultaneously, we are acknowledging that if we love Allah (SWT) truly, and ask His help in resolving our issues’ then, the resolution will be real. A true Muslim who says these words, with sincere belief in Him, has no reason to be depressed. As genuine believers, we believe in the knowledge, power, and wisdom of Allah, SWT. He is always present for our help. He is unique in everything he does and each of His attributes are unique. Even the word, ALLAH is unique. Allah is pronounced uniquely which says you are dealing with someone like nobody else. It is said that the word “Allah” is originated from “Al- ilah,” which means the one and the only, to be worshiped.

Now, back to the phrase, “Bismillahi Ar-Rahmani Ar-Raheem”. The word, “Bismillah”- when you call on that phrase, the believer is to be filled with gratitude as in how many ways Allah has helped us. We go to Allah for all our needs and worries. Then on to, “Ar-Rahman” which means love, care and mercy of Allah (SWT), which is extreme as well as immediate. But, this is temporary like thirst and hunger which needs immediate action to quench the thirst and reduce the hunger. And the second one, “Ar-Raheem”, which is again love, care and mercy of Allah (SWT) but with high degree of His Compassion, that is permanent. So not to worry at all, Allah (SWT) will take care of you immediately and will take care of you on a permanent basis. All we need to do is firmly believe in Him, SWT, the one and only one worthy of worship; submit ourselves to Him as His obedient servants, take all guidance from Him as practiced by our beloved Prophet Mohammad, SAW and complete all actions of our lives starting with “Bismillahi Ar-Rahmani Ar-Raheem;” and ending with thanking Him, SWT. This is the desired life of a Muslim.
