The [**Initiative on Islam and Medicine (II&M)**](https://www.medicineandislam.org/overview/), located in Brookfield, Wisconsin, conducts research on Islam and Biomedicine. Their research programs are focused on the theological, social, and biomedical aspects of religion and medicine and are meant to benefit the health of American Muslims and also in the development of an academic, multidisciplinary field of Islamic Bioethics. They support and provide scholarships to healthcare providers and religious leaders and act as a platform for impactful research and tailored education. Additionally, II&M provides educational opportunities, workshops, consultations, courses and certifications, medical student internships, and hosts events that facilitate the participation of medical and social scientists, Islamic studies experts, and Islamic scholars. 

After extensive pilot testing and methodical curation, as claimed by II&M, they have announced the launch of a self-paced, multi-modal course named [“An Introduction to the Field of Islamic Bioethics”](https://www.medicineandislam.org/bioethics-course/). This course is said to benefit Muslim clinicians, healthcare practitioners, medical students and trainees, chaplains, religious leaders, bioethicists, and patients and is based on II&M’s principles of data-driven, theologically appropriate, and research-tested intellectual resources to engage with contemporary healthcare. The course will introduce learners to:
*	Critical concepts in Islamic theology and law that undergird normative ethical frameworks
*	Scholarly discussions regarding the methods, content, and scope of Islamic bioethics and
*	Extant normative rulings and discursive products of applied Islamic bioethics relate to end-of-life care, organ donation, and reproductive health.

This course is based on adult learning theory and is a 10-module course that runs in 4-months cohorts. It involves:
*	Specially curated lectures and readings that allow for active learning as participants engage with the source material of Islamic bioethics,
*	Summative lectures that hit on the key points from the material with added experiential commentary and explanation from a practicing clinician, clinical ethicist, health policy consultant, and scholar 
*	Short quick-hitting reflection questions and quizzes that allow for the learning to be concretized 

Additionally, the course yields 16.5 CME and MOC credits for physicians. At the completion of the course, participants will be able to:
*	Describe the sources of Islamic morality
*	Identify the producers, consumers, and the discursive material of Islamic bioethics
*	Describe the contentions around what constitutes the "Islamic" in Islamic bioethics
*	Apply critical analysis skills to decipher gaps in the Islamic bioethics discourse
*	Delineate the major Islamic juridical views on end-of-life healthcare, organ donation, and reproductive health
