 Did you know that Alim.org has a section on biographies?  Just visit Alim.org and click on Biography, and you'll have instant access to the stories of the prophets, including the life of Muhammad (s), the history of the Khulafah Rashidun, and bios for over 50 Sahaba! While reading, you can scroll to the bottom of any page and see what people are saying about what you are reading.   Then you can post your own comments to let others know what you learned or your own questions for others to possibly answer. 

We also wanted to mention that Alim.org is and inshallah will always remain a free service brought to you by the Alim Foundation - a non- profit organization.  And while there are many unpaid volunteers involved with the project, the expenses born to create the technology behind it are paid out of pocket by members the foundation, friends and family, and users such as you.  We have many ideas and enhancements for the site planned which are yet to come. Your donations will help us achieve these goals and make Alim.org one of the most important Islamic destinations on the internet.  So if you benefit from Alim.org or can appreciate the potential for others to, why not consider donating?  Just visit Alim.org and click on the donate button for more information. Donating would be a means of securing for yourself Sadaqa Jariya as described to us by the Prophet (s): 

"When a person dies, his works end, except for three: ongoing charity, knowledge that is benefited from, and a righteous child who prays for him."
