 Umm Salihah Ahmed, a wonderful mother explains her love to her kids and the specialty of mother’s day in her life. She says that as her kids are still very young, and she is not expecting more from them. She is very happy about what they gifted her for a mother’s day. Her five little kids gifted her abstract-patterned scarf, chocolates and a bouquet of flowers. On such occasions, she love to be at her mother’s home with cooking, having food and a lot of joy together.
