 Smile is considered as an act of reward and honor. Breaking a smile at your spouse is considered a bigger act of reward. If you did not speak properly to your spouse, why did you marry? Why are you spoiling the life of a daughter or a son? A question to think! Keep an act of worship to your spouse by making him or happy with your pleasant smile and mind. By knowing and studying the nature of your spouse, make him or her happy with your smile. This will be a reward and opening to know Allah.
