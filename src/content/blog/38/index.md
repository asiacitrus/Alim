It is allowed to listen to the Quran on radio or television, mp3 at your convenient times. Allah said that whenever the Quran is recited, you must listen to it attentively and be silent so that He may have mercy upon you (Quran, Al-A'raf, 7:204). You can listen to it while you are driving or working in the kitchen and so on. It is neither encouraging nor respectful to the Quran, to say like which verse is this, which Surah is this, what is he saying etc. while listening to the Quran. Every Muslim should learn and listen to Quran with devotion and love to receive the pleasure of Allah, the Exalted.
