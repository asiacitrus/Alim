 Great News: Alim.org now has recitation for the Quran!  We’ve added 13 popular recitations in both Murattal and Mujawwad styles!  Now you can hear the recitation of ayaat from some of while studying them and interacting with the community by reading and responding to other people’s comments about them. 


Recitation on Alim.org comes equipped with functionality that provides 
you with a lot of control over how and what is recited.  You can set 
the reciter to play an entire surah or just a set of ayaat and also 
specify a number of times to repeat any unit of recitation.  This ends 
up providing a great tool that can assist with memorization of the 
Quran and helping to learn how to properly recite it. 


Please visit the site and try out recitation if you haven’t already 
done so.  We’re eager to hear your feedback and as always, please 
spread the word about us!
