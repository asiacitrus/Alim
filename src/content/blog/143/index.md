 Here is the story of a young woman of 23 named Kearney-Argow who has been using pain killers over years. She had been in three car accidents and was suffering from consequent neck pain and migraines. She started using pain killers for each time. When ever she approaches her doctor, she used to get dangerous pain killers in the prescription. Every time she took Opioid stupors to relieve from pain. She says that it is easy to get Opiates here in the cities of New Jersey. She used cannabis, ketamine and some other powerful pain killers that doctors normally prescribe to cancer victims. Due to the over dosage in using pain killers, her weight fell to 43kg and she did even stopped going college. Some how, this lady is getting back to her normal state and started going for a job. Al Jazeera reports say that “According to the US government&#8217;s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioid abuse is an &#8220;epidemic&#8221;. The number of overdose deaths involving opioids &#8211; including some strong painkillers and heroin &#8211; nearly quadrupled between 1999 and 2014”.

Reports say that 78 Americans die every day due to over dosage of pain killers and other pills mixed with Alcohol. 2017 budget request of President Barack Obama allotted $1.1bn to treat opioid addicts who want help. In fact the crisis is that every single family in United States is facing the pain killer addiction, that one of the family members would be using a pain killer. And this addiction turns to serious sickness to them. former politician Patrick Kennedy said that spending a little more for treatment would be far better than filling the addicts in courthouses, jails and emergency rooms. Now America has banned hard drugs like heroine, but still uses opioid pain killers. Oxycodone and Hydrocodone were once reserved for severe pain of those recovering from car crashes and surgery, and those getting palliative care for AIDS, cancer and other killers. Some reports say that in 2013, physicians prescribed nearly a quarter of a billion opioid drugs. Various recommendations and reports say that it is time to stop using pain killers in United States for diseases and move with some other healthy alternatives to this issue.
