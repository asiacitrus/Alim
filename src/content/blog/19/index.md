 The year 2017 is coming to an end, insha’Allah, and it has been a year full of turmoil and emotional ups and downs. As time goes on, we witness the forewarnings spoken by our beloved Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, unfold before our very eyes. 

However, amid this chaos, there are still rays of hope shining from the Heavens, as we hold fast to the rope of Allah and stand in supplication, and we watch Islam continue to grow, despite the adversities. We still have in our hands the ability to spread the knowledge of Islam throughout the world; now more than ever before because of technological advances that allow us to access this knowledge at the click of a button. 

As we approach the end of this year, please do not forget to support our organization, as we continue to make the Qur’an and Sunnah readily accessible through our Islamic software, our Alim.org website and Alim Qur’an and Hadith app. 

The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, once said: “If the Hour starts to happen and in the hand of one of you is a palm shoot or seedling; then if he's able to plant it before the Hour happens, then let him plant it”.  As-Silsilah as-Saheehah #9.
