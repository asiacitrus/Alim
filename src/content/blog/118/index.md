**October 29, 2020**

Praise be to Allah, the Exalted, the Creator & the Sustainer of the worlds, the Supreme. He (SWT) created humans as His best creation and guided the first couple, Adam & Eve, directly to obey Him and follow His Commands. Later He sent His Messengers and Prophets to continually refresh His guidance to human beings. Finally, He sent Mohammad (PBUH), as His last messenger who accomplished his mission over a period of twenty-three years (610-632 AD). All Muslims are required to learn and follow the teachings of our prophet who exemplified and lived the Quran.

Mohammad (PBUH) was born (and passed away) on the 12th day of Rabi al-Awwal, 570 AD of the Islamic calendar. This day will fall on October 29, 2020. Although not firm, this date is generally accepted among the scholars and celebrated by Muslims across the world.  It is important to note that public celebration, commemoration, or festivals of Mohammadï¿½s birthday was not known until the early 12th century AD. It is said to be started in Iraq and was strengthened and expanded in the 13th century AD during the Fatimid Dynasty of Egypt. Today, we see extraordinarily large gatherings, celebrations, and processions that Mohammad (PBUH) would never approve of. 

Muslims universally love the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH). It is observed time and again that they love him above themselves, their parents, their families to the best of their understanding. This love must translate into true following of the Prophet (PBUH). This could only be achieved through studying the Quran, authentic Hadith, Seerah, self-evaluation, and good companionship that guides to the right path. True success for a Muslim entail pleasing Allah with his or her life. This is the only way to achieve success in the hereafter and requires knowledge and practice of the teachings of Mohammad (PBUH). May Allah guide us towards that path. Ameen.
