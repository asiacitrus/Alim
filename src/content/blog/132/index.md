 Ramadan literally termed as the ninth month of calendar and the month of fasting for preaching and reaching Allah. When Ramadan comes, all the Islamic devotees get energized and excited to put up the lanterns and decorations all around to welcome the blessed month. We must welcome Ramadan with neat and tidy home, in neat dress and with prayers. Ramadan is the reminder of renewal of your mind and life to reach Allah. All Islamic devotees must fast from water, food and luxuries. The most important thing to remind in Ramadan is that devotees should fast by keeping the oath that this year I want to grow my character to be more like that of Prophet Muhammad and to cherish goodness to the society.
