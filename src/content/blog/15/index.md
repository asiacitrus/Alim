**Assalamu Alikum WaRahmatullahi WaBarakatuhu,**

As we approach the end of 2015, we’re humbled to be able to
serve the community through Alim’s comprehensive platform.&nbsp; We first thank Allah SWT, who has enabled us so that we can carry on this work of Da’wa.

Secondly, we would like to take this opportunity to thank our generous donors for their continuous support and encouragement.

This past year, Alim Foundation has achieved many
milestones, including improved web portal with added functionalities and new contents, new translations, new Tafaseer, as well as , new versions of Android
and Apple apps to name a few. We were able to do many of these enhancements because of donors like you.

Take advantage of the tax break before the year end, please [donate](https://www.alim.org/donate/) generously to help us continue this noble work. Alim.org is a non-profit 501 c organization, and your donations are tax deductible. Act before December 31st 2015 to take advantage of 2015 tax break.

Please visit us at [www.alim.org](/) to donate and support us!

Wassalam Walaykum WaRahmatullahi WaBrarakatahu
