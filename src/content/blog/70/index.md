 “A woman is sought in marriage for one of four things; her wealth, beauty, family and faith. Make sure to choose the one with strong faith.”- In this Hadith, Prophet delivers that people are giving more importance while choosing a wife. They prefer more for her wealth, beauty, family, faith and so on. But the very important thing is that faith is the first to prefer while selecting your wife. Values and faith can make a good and God-fearing wife. Parents must follow the same thing while selecting a husband for their daughter. Islam is fully against the system of giving or taking dowry, land , furniture or housing. A faithful and God-fearing spouse can lead a good life with his or her partner.
