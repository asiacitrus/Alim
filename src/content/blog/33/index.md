 Prayer is the best time to see Allah. His followers should stand beautifully while taking the prayer for him. Beautify yourself when you take the prayer. Dress nicely when you stand in front of Allah. You beautify yourself with whatever you are able to from beautification in appreciation for the prayer and glorification of the position between yourself and your Lord.
