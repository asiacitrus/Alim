 You look so gorgeous on your profile pic! So funny and dangerous the caption is. This is a problem of crisis. If a person tells you such words in internet or any social networking sites, you just ignore it and think now on. Allah doesn&#8217;t like to expose his servant&#8217;s body. So please don&#8217;t expose your body parts or never publish your photos in social networking sites. To keep the family life risk free and peaceful, please avoid using snaps in social networking sites. You must teach your kids to do the same for their best future.
