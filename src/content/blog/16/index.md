 We are excited to announce that the Alim team will be at the annual ICNA-MAS Convention in Baltimore, MD this coming Memorial Day Weekend, May 28-30. Booth # 838

We will be sharing many exciting plans, insha’Allah, to optimize our mobile apps and website, to bring you more of what you have come to expect from Alim. 

The Alim Foundation has been working diligently to improve all of our products and services. As you know, • you have our web portal, which is a one-stop shop of authentic Islamic educational resources •	your forums where you can connect with other students of knowledge to share ideas or ask questions •	your new versions of Android and Apple apps for knowledge on the go, and much more.  

•	Best of all: These services are available free of charge!

Our donors help keep our initiatives alive, so we would like to take this opportunity to thank them and we ask Allah to multiply their rewards in this life and the next. Ameen! Please consider investing in this cause so that it may be a sadaqah jariyah, an ongoing charity, for you by Allah’s permission. 

Don’t forget to stop by our booth #838 to meet our team and get to know more about what Alim Foundation has to offer. 

Take this opportunity to ask questions and find out why Alim.org is the most useful Islamic software in the world! 

Download the free apps for Android and iPhone and personally let us know what you think. Also, please share this information with your families and friends. 

We will see you at the convention, insha’Allah!
