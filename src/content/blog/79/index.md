 Shahroz, a pure devotee of Allah expresses his thoughts, learning and healings come from a conversation with Allah. He is speaking about himself and how he don’t need to turn to certain things, even with any issue that we have to realize any healing comes from a conversation with Allah. He dedicates a song to Allah explaining how to heal mental illness.

Shahroz explains that when he gets into a mental illness or frustrated mood, he just follow the Sunnah with persistence. He does not need a medicaid or medication to alleviate his pain. Allah’s wonderful life and role model preaching are the best blessings upon him- says Shahroz.
