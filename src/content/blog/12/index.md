 Safar is the second month of the Islamic calendar. The definition is empty and the reasoning is all the Muslims would rush towards the battlefield (at the time of the Prophet (SAW), leaving their houses deserted after Muharram. Moreover, superstitions were widespread during the days of ignorance (pre-Islam). These superstitions were made irrelevant by the following Quran verse: "No misfortune befalls except by Allahâ€™s command..." [Surah Tagabun, Verse 11]. Folks in those days believed bad omens and evils occurred in Safar, but all those beliefs were incorrect. As stated in Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2222: There is no bad omen in the month of Safar and no ghouls (evil spirits). Superstition is for folks who lack faith and trust in Allah (SWA).

Assalamwalakum.
