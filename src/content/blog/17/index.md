 Ramadan is approaching fast, insha'Allah, are you ready? What goals have you set for yourself this year? 

We know that while the month of Ramadan is upon us, life continues. The majority of us will still have to go to work, rush to school, take care of household responsibilities, look after our families, etc. 

Although our schedules will still be jam-packed, insha’Allah, we will strive to make whatever adjustments are needed to wake up for Suhoor, read more Qur’an, make it to taraweeh, and wake up for tahajjud prayers. 

We will also try to eliminate distractions and vices, so we can purify and replenish our iman. 
Examples of such distractions are:

•	watching television
•	playing video games
•	listening to music
•	surfing the web
•	social media
•	spending hours on our cell phones, doing all of the above

Why not use our “screen” time as opportunities for increasing our Islamic knowledge? 
With Alim.org and the free Alim Quran and Hadith Platform app for Apple and Android, you can search in Qur’an and ahadith, read the different translations and understand the meanings and roots of Arabic words in the Qur’an, learn about Islamic history and the life of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and so much more. 

When we feel the urge to scroll through useless posts on Facebook, call or text our friends, or play that game on our iphone, we can turn on the Alim app instead and choose from its many features. 

Make a promise to yourself that you will make the most of your time this Ramadan, insha’Allah. And remember to remind others to do the same. Download the Alim app for free and bookmark Alim.org!

May Allah, the Mighty and the Majestic, allow us to reach Ramadan so we can reap its benefits and gain Allah’s Mercy and forgiveness. Ameen.
