 Many of us fall in to depression. Some of us end up our life due to depression. Depression is the state that we cannot see any good thing in our life. With a very simple act, we can wash away the depression. The act is known as Sujood ash-Shukr. This is showing the gratitude to Allah. Gratitude to Allah is the best remedy for depression. Lack of the sense of gratitude will lead you to depression. Doing prostration of thankfulness regularly will remove your depression.
