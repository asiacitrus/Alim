Praise be to Allah. Every year Muslims celebrate two major religious Holidays- Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Both celebrations commence after completing an obligational worship prescribed by Allah. Eid al-Fitr follows 30 days of fasting during Ramadan, and Eid al-Adha is celebrated after the Hajj. Fasting and Hajj are the third and fourth pillars of Islam. 

Eid al-Fitr will fall on May 23rd or 24th this year and many of us are unsure of what to do given the current pandemic situation causing a shutdown of all places of worship. Most of us are currently praying Jumah and Tarawih at home and will likely do the same or Eid prayers. Some of us are holding socially distanced, family visits outdoors, while others are doing drive-bys. Some families may continue with virtual visits through video calls.

Islamic scholars have issued multiple fatwas on mosque closures, Friday, daily, Tarawih and Eid prayers. Please visit the following links to read details about the Islamic, legal opinions and decisions in the US:
