 Common question that come across many in Islam religion is that to whom I should seek questions. Those who have deep understanding of the religion, and those who are well known for his religiosity and those who are established people of deep understanding. Don’t put your religious understanding with those who doesn’t have any religious understanding. The person to whom you are seeking religious knowledge should be striving and speaker of truth. When you seek knowledge, seek it from a tree that has fruits. Knowledge is not a bunch of information. It must incorporate some intellect and it must sound understanding. One who is having the right attitude and keeping away from sins is the right person to seek information and questions. You can seek knowledge from renowned persons and scholars who are providing speeches through internet videos; YouTube videos etc. while approaching a source for your doubts, be careful, consider and consult.
