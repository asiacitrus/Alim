 Umm Salihah a mom to five children is always curious about lifeâ€™s little magic. She would love to learn and inspire from the small as well as bug incidents happened in her life. In her opinion blog-happymuslimah.com, she talks about her love, learn and inspire lists. Umm Salihah love to travel and enjoy the travel experience of others. She loves to see and get inspired from great travel images shared through Whatsapp and social media. She loves everything passed through her life. She has got a passion for learning about human behavior, brain, personality, intelligence and socialization. But it had never occurred in a state to her to consider psychology from an Islamic perspective. Soon after she listened to two lectures by Ustadh Nauman Ali Khan on the Islamic view of Psychology, they really made her to think more. Now she is trying to devour anything on the intersection between Islam and Psychology that she can find.
