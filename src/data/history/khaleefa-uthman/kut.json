    "text": "<p>\\n    The exact date of birth of Uthman is not known with any degree of certainty. There is also some controversy about the exact age attained by Uthman. When he died in 656 C.E. some said that he was eighty-five, while others said that he was eighty. There were some persons who held that he was only sixty-three.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The Holy Prophet died at the age of sixty-three. Abu Bakr died at the same age. The age of Umar at the time of his martyrdom was also around sixty-three. The age of sixty-three thus acquired a particular sanctity among the Muslims, and this age was attributed by some persons to Uthman merely as a mark of sanctity.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The weight of available evidence is to the effect that Uthman was eighty years old at the time of his martyrdom. On this basis it can be computed that Uthman was born around 576 C.E. That was six years after the \"Year of the Elephant\" the year when Abraha the Christian Viceroy of Yemen invaded Makkah, and had to withdraw having failed in his object. Uthman was younger than the Holy Prophet of Islam by five or six years.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Although the family of Uthman belonged to Makkah they had some property in Taif as well, and Uthman was born in Taif and not in Makkah. As Taif is a hill station, the presumption is that Uthman was born during the summer months of the year 576 C.E.\\n   </p>"

Abd Shams and Hashim were the two sons of Abd Manaf. The Holy Prophet was descended from Hashim, while Uthman was a descendant of Abd Shams. The Holy Prophet was fourth in descent from Abd Manaf, while Uthman was fifth in descent from Abd Manaf. Affan the father of Uthman was thus a second cousin of the Holy Prophet, and Uthman was a nephew of the Holy Prophet.\\n   </p><p>\\n    On the mother's side Uthman's relationship with the Holy Prophet was still closer. His mother was Urwa.

    "text": "<p>\\n    No account has been preserved about the early life of Uthman. Only a few stray facts can be gleaned from here and there and on the basis of this meager information, we can have some glimpses of the early life of Uthman.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman was born with the proverbial silver spoon in his mouth. His father Affan was a merchant and was counted as one of the richest men among the Quraish. Uthman was one of the few young men in Makkah who could read and write. This shows that as a child, Uthman received formal education.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman spent the days of his childhood like other Arab children. One of the games played by the Arab children was to uncover themselves and carry stones in their shirts. One day when as a child Uthman had uncovered himself he heard a voice \"Cover yourself\". Uthman hastened to cover himself. Thereafter he never uncovered himself. Thus at an early age, Uthman developed the habit of modesty, and that remained his lifelong attribute.\\n   </p><p>\\n    It is related that while young, Uthman once traveled with his father to Yemen. They were accompanied by Abdul Rahman b Auf and his father. When they returned they carried the money of a man of B. Jadhima Amir who had died in Yemen, to his heirs. One man Khalid b Hisham met them in the Jadhima territory before they could get to the family of the dead man who demanded the money. They refused to pay the money to Khalid b Hisham. That led to fighting in which Auf the father of Abdul Rahman, and al Fakih b al Mughira were killed. Uthman and his father succeeded in escaping from the Banu Jadhima territory. The Quraish of Makkah thereupon planned to attack the Banu Jadhima, but the Banu Jadhima paid the compensation and the blood money, and the dispute was settled.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Affan the father of Uthman died young when travelling abroad. Uthman was hardly twenty years old at the time of the death of his father. His father, however, left much wealth for him to inherit. Uthman followed the same profession as his father. His business flourished, and after a few years he became a millionaire, one of the richest men among the Quraish. For his wealth, Uthman came to be called \"Uthman Ghani\".\\n   </p><p>\\n    After the death of Affan, Urwa the mother of Uthman married Uqba bin Maheet. From the accounts that have come down to us it appears that Urwa had only two children from Affan, namely: Uthman and his sister Amna. She. bore Uqba three sons and one daughter, namely: Walid; Khalid;'Amr and Umm Kulthum.\\n   </p><p>\\n    It appears that during the age of ignorance, Uthman had two wives, namely Umm'Amr bint Jandab, and Fatimah bint Al Walid. Bint 'Amr was the mother of 'Amr, Khalid; Aban; Umar; and Maryam. Fatimah was the mother of Walid; Said; and Umm Said.\\n   </p><p>\\n    'Amr, was the eldest son of Uthman, and during the pre-Islamic period, Uthman was known by the surname of Abu'Amr.\\n   </p>"

There were faint marks of small pox on his face, which instead of disfiguring the comeliness of his appearance, added to his beauty. He was full bearded, and the beard looked well on his face. The locks of the hair of his head fell below his ears. He was large of limbs, broad between the shoulders; fleshy in the thighs,; and long in the forearms.

In the immoral society of Makkah in the age of ignorance, he led a chaste life. He never touched wine. He did not gamble, and took no part in the frivolities which formed the pastime of the youth of Makkah.\\n   </p><p>\\n    He was a good trader and made ample money out of trade, but he never resorted to unfair practices in trade. He was scrupulously honest, and believed in fair deal. He amassed considerable wealth through honest means. On account of his wealth he came to be known as \"Ghan)\". In spite of being a millionaire, his way of life was not that of a capitalist. He was a man of simple habits, and did not indulge in a luxurious way of life. He used a greater part of his wealth in helping those in distress. He had a flair for social work. He supported many poor families. He awarded liberal stipends to widows and orphans who had none to support them. He was soft spoken and kind hearted. He had a kind word for every one who came across him. He patronized his relatives, and gave liberal aid to such relatives who were in straitened circumstances.\\n   </p><p>\\n    He enjoyed the friendship of Abu Bakr. Even in the pre-Islamic period he profited from the company of the Holy Prophet. He was much impressed with the personality of the Holy Prophet, and always sought his counsel and guidance. He did not worship the idols in the Kaaba. He had little faith in the superstitious practices in which the people of Makkah indulged. He felt that those who worshipped the idols merely groped in the dark. In his heart of hearts he felt that these lifeless idols could not be expected to control the destinies of mankind. He felt that the center of power lay elsewhere. He had the inner conviction that some day the Truth would dawn in some manifest form.\\n   </p><p>\\n    He was an embodiment of modesty. In spite of his wealth there was no sense of pride in him. He never boasted of anything. He never tried to thrust his opinion on others. He believed in action rather than talk. There was a particular decorum and dignity about him. He was very particular that by his behavior he did not offend any body. On account of his endearing qualities of head and heart, he enjoyed great popularity among the people of Makkah.\\n   </p>"

This year the business of Uthman had been particularly brisk, and he had earned a huge profit. On the return journey the caravan halted for the night at a way side station between Zarqa and Ma'an in Syria. As Uthman lay on his bed beneath the star-studded sky, he felt impressed with the vastness and dimensions of space. He thought that the universe with such vast dimensions could not be without a master. In his heart of hearts he felt that some transcendent Being would surely be the master of the universe complex. While he was thus lost in thoughts, and was half-awake and half asleep, he heard a voice, \"O, you who are asleep, wake up, for in Makkah the Prophet Ahmad has appeared\". Uthman looked around, but there was no body to be seen. The voice that Uthman had heard was not a human voice: it appeared to come from outer space.\\n   </p>"

There was already outstanding rivalry between the Umayyah and the Hashimite sections of the Quraish, and the Umayyads could not tolerate that a young man of the house of the Umayyah should owe allegiance to the prophethood of a scion of the house of Hashim. Affan the father of Uthman was dead by this time, and Hakam b Al A'as, an uncle of Uthman was the head of the family. Hakam was a neighbor of the Holy Prophet, and when he came to know that his nephew had been converted to Islam he was infuriated, and he took Uthman to task. He bound Uthman with a cord, and wanted him to repudiate his allegiance to the Holy Prophet. When Urwa the mother of Uthman came to know of his conversion to Islam, she was very bitter, and exhorted Uthman to recant and return to the faith of his forefathers. The stepfather of Uthman, Upba b Abi Muheet whom Urwa the mother of Uthman had married after the death of Affan was in the forefront in the opposition to Islam. Uthman was warned that unless he recanted from his faith in Islam, he would have to suffer serious consequences. Uthman remained firm in his resolve. He told all concerned that he was prepared to face the consequences but he could not abandon Islam which was the way of Truth.\\n   </p>"

Uthman and Ruqayya felt that the atmosphere in Makkah was not congenial. Uthman had already some business contacts in Abyssinia, and after a good deal of deliberation and consultation with the Holy Prophet, Uthman and Ruqayya decided to migrate to Abyssinia. On their departure the Holy Prophet prayed for their safety and protection. He said that after the Prophet Lot, Uthman was the first to migrate with his family in the way of Allah. After Uthman and his wife had left for Abyssinia, some other Muslims also left for Abyssinia. The Negus of Abyssinia welcomed the emigrants, and provided them with all necessary facilities for their stay in his dominions. The Quraish sent a delegation to Abyssinia to prevail upon the Negus to expel the Muslims from his State.

The brotherhood thus established was unique in the annals of mankind. So strong and cordial were these bonds that they even surpassed the relationship of blood. The Ansars helped their immigrant brothers liberally. Uthman did not stand in need of any financial help from his Ansar brother. He was one of the richest merchants of Makkah, and had amassed considerable fortune. He brought all such fortune with him to Madina. In Madina the Muslims were generally agriculturists and were not very much interested in trade. The trade of the town was in the hands of the Jews. There was thus considerable scope for the Muslims in promoting trade. Uthman took advantage of this position and established himself as a trader in Madina. He worked hard and honestly, and his business flourished. Soon he became one of the richest men in Madina as he had been one of the richest merchants in Makkah.\\n   </p>"

One day in the Prophet's mosque at Madina the Muslims brought their difficulty to the notice of the Holy Prophet. Thereupon addressing the congregation the Holy Prophet said, \"O ye Muslims, who among you would like to purchase the Beer Rauma for the Muslims in return for a home in paradise.

This time the Quraish of Makkah came with a force of 3,000 men to avenge their defeat at Badr. To meet them the Muslims could raise a force of 1,000 persons only., and even out of these three hundred persons under Abdullah b Ubayy a hypocrite withdrew at the last moment thus leaving seven hundred persons only in face the hostile Quraish.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The Holy Prophet arranged his force in battle array, and posted a contingent of archers to guard a vulnerable passage in the rear. The archers were instructed that they were not to leave their positions without further orders.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The Quraish charged with full force, but the Muslims held fast. Then in a counter attack the Muslims broke the enemy's line, and the Quraish fell back. At this stage the contingent of the Muslim archers left their positions in order to plunder the camp of the retreating Quraish. Khalid b Walid who was a non-Muslim at the time, and was fighting on the side of the Quraish rushed forward with his contingent, and occupied the positions vacated by the Muslim archers. That fumed the tide of the battle. The Quraish rallied, and launched an attack on the Muslims both from the front as well as the rear. In the confusion that followed many Muslims were martyred. Even the Holy Prophet was wounded, and he fell in a pit where many of his followers lay dead. That led to the rumor that the Holy Prophet was dead. At this critical stage some of the Muslims left the battlefield thinking that if the Holy Prophet was dead, everything was lost, and nothing was left to fight about. Uthman was one of the persons who left the battlefield.\\n   </p><p>\\n    This conduct of the Muslims who had left the battlefield was not approved by Allah. Allah, however, forgave them as their lapse was not deliberate and was based on misunderstanding. A revelation to the Holy Prophet said:\\n   </p><p>\\n    \"Behold you were climbing up the high ground, without even casting a single glance at any one, and the Apostle in your rear was calling you back.

He, however, felt consoled that Allah in His Mercy had forgiven him, and blotted out his lapse. When Uthman saw the Holy Prophet later, and expressed his regrets the Holy Prophet asked him to cheer up for Allah had forgiven him for his lapse. That made Uthman make the resolve that in other expeditions he would not lag behind.\\n   </p>"

The Holy Prophet said, \"Yes, Uthman, you may ask whatever you wish\". Uthman said, \"I crave the life of Abdullah b Saad. I know of his crimes but he is repentant and God is Forgiving. He is my foster brother and my foster mother has put great pressure on me to intercede in his behalf\". The Holy Prophet remained silent. After some time Uthman repeated his request. The Holy Prophet still gave no reply. When Uthman repeated his request for the third time, the Holy Prophet said: \"Alright; let him be free. May God forgive him\".\\n   </p><p>\\n    Thereafter all the Quraish of Makkah were converted to Islam and they took the oath of allegiance to the Holy Prophet. These included the mother of Uthman, his step brothers and sisters and other members of his family. The family which had remained apart on account of difference in faith was now reunited, and this reunion was a matter of great joy for Uthman. After conversion to Islam, the people of Makkah began a new life. Heretofore they had been the inveterate enemies of Islam, henceforward they were to be the dedicated servants of Islam.\\n   </p>"

The only way to overcome the resistance of the enemy was to tighten the blockade, and drag on the siege till the provisions in the fort were exhausted. That meant that the siege had to be continued for a long time. The Holy Prophet had other pressing business to undertake, and he could not afford to spend so much time in besieging Taif. The Holy Prophet held a council of war as to the course of action. The council included Uthman.

Thus the Muslims gained by raising the siege of Taif what they could not secure by carrying on the war. From Makkah the Holy Prophet and hit companions returned to Madina.

The highest bid they could offer was cent per cent profit. Uthman said that he would not sell his goods at a profit less than ten times the original price. The traders said that they could not afford him profit to that extent and that no body could do that. Uthman said that he had already an offer for ten times profit. \"Who had made such offer\", inquired the traders. Uthman said that God had assured him of ten times profit.

    "text": "<p>\\n    The instructions of Umar were that the Selection Committee should choose the successor within three days, and he should assume office on the fourth day. As two days passed away without arriving at a decision, the members felt anxious that the time was running fast, and still no solution to the problem appeared to be in sight.\\n   </p><p>\\n    On the night after the second day, Abdul Rahman b Auf had a dream; He saw that in a wilderness a strong and handsome camel appeared and the wilderness was converted into a rich green pasture on which it fell, and then moved away.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Thereafter another camel came. It tarried in the pasture for a short time, and then following in the footsteps of the first camel moved away. Then the third camel. It tarried in the pasture for some time, and then thereafter looking right and left, it also moved away following the footsteps of the first two camels. Then came the fourth camel. It limped and could walk with difficulty. Then a strong hot wind began to blow from the desert, and the pasture became parched. The camel was unable to feed itself, and then limping it moved away in the same direction which the previous three camels had left.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Abdul Rahman b Auf interpreted this dream to signify that the first camel represented the Holy Prophet who gave mankind the message of Islam, and thereby spearheaded a great revolution. The second camel represented Abu Bakr who followed in the footsteps of the Master, but whose rule was short. The third camel represented Umar whose rule was comparatively longer. The fourth camel represented the successor of Umar. The dream signified that the rule of such successor was to end in some disaster.\\n   </p><p>\\n    That made Abdul Rahman b Auf feel that he should not covet the office for himself. On the third day addressing the members of the Selection Committee, Abdul Rahman b Auf observed that if they went on debating and wrangling in that way, differences among them would grow in dimensions, and they would fail in the objective set for them. He suggested that in order to narrow down the choice, some of them should withdraw from the contest voluntarily. Thereupon he declared that in the interests of the Muslim community, he withdrew from the contest of his freewill. The choice now came to be restricted to the remaining four members, but still no headway was made. There were some further deliberations,\\n   </p><p>\\n    and thereafter it was decided that as Abdul Rahman b Auf had retired voluntarily from the contest and had given proof of his selflessness, he might choose the Caliph out of the remaining four members. Abdul Rahman accepted the onerous task, and undertook that in arriving at his decision he would be just and impartial, and would be guided solely by the interests of the Muslim community. He added that he would try to ascertain public opinion, and his choice would be in accord with such opinion.\\n   </p>"

Interviewing Ali he asked him, \"Suppose I do not choose you; in that case whom would you like me to choose? \" Ali said, \"In that case you may choose Uthman\". Uthman was interviewed next, and he was asked the question, \"If you are not selected who should be the next choice?\" Uthman said, \"In that case the obvious choice would be Ali\". When Zubair b Awamm was put the same question he said, \"Ali or Uthman. When Saad b Abi Waqas waS interviewed he said that he would like Abdul Rahman b Auf to be the Caliph. Abdul Rahman said that as he had withdrawn from the contest his choice should be from among the other four members. Saad b Abl Waqas said that in that case, Uthman would be his choice. Analyzing these answers, Abdul Rahman b Auf came to the conclusion that Uthman commanded the majority of votes among the members of the selection committee.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Thereafter Abdul Rahman b Auf proceeded to consult the other leaders of public opinion in Madina. Some Bedouiin chiefs had arrived in Madina to participate in the funeral ceremonies of Umar. Abdul Rahman b Auf consulted these men as well. Obviously the choice lay between Ali and Uthman. Out of these Ali was still young being less than fifty, while Uthman was old being nearly seventy. According to the Arab traditions of respect for old age the common men expressed themselves in favor of Uthman, the older among the two candidates.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Umar had been a hard task master. He was not only harsh with the people, he was harsh even with himself and his family members. The people now wanted a change, and they favored Uthman who was well known for his mildness, kindness and generosity. The people could not forget that Uthman was a rich man, and he had used a greater part of his wealth for public welfare. He had purchased the Be'er Rauma well from the Jews for the purpose of supplying water to the Muslims. He had financed the project for the extension of the Prophet's mosque. He had financed a greater part of the expedition to Tabuk. In the time of famine he had donated large stocks of grain for public distribution. He used to liberate a slave every month.\\n   </p><p>\\n    After meeting the public, Abdul Rahman b Auf arrived at the conclusion that an overwhelming majority of the people favored the election of Uthman. Thereafter Abdul Rahman had another round of meeting with Ali and Uthman. Addressing Ali he asked, \"If you are elected as the Caliph do you undertake to follow the Quran and the Sunnah, and the traditions set by your predecessors?\" Ali said that he would follow the Quran and the Sunnah, but in the matter of the traditions of his predecessors he would follow them as far as possible. and would exercise his own judgment in each case. When the same question was put to Uthman, he gave an unconditional undertaking. That made Abdul Rahman b Auf give his verdict in favor of Uthman.\\n   </p>"

He dwelt at length on the merits of both the candidates, and observed that after consulting the people at large he had arrived at the conclusion that the majority of the people favored the succession of Uthman. He declared on solemn oath that in arriving at the decision he had not been moved by any extraneous consideration. He had taken the decision in the sole interest of the Muslim community. Addressing Ali he said that he should not feel annoyed at the decision. He was still young, and there would be further opportunities for him to come to power. He appealed to him to accept the decision in the interests of Muslim solidarity. Thereafter Abdul Rahman b Auf said to Uthman \"Stretch forth your hand so that I may take the oath of allegiance to you\". Uthman stretched his hand, and Abdul Rahman b Auf took the oath of allegiance to him as the Caliph. Thereafter all the Muslims gathered in the mosque took the oath of allegiance to Uthman. Ali felt dissatisfied, but he too took the oath of allegiance to Uthman. Thus Uthman was elected as the third Caliph. That was the first day of the year 24 A.H.\\n   </p>"

Whenever the Holy Prophet received a revelation, he would dictate it to some person who would record it on some piece of leather, date skin or even bones and stones. The principal scribe of the Holy Prophet was Zaid b Thabit. Uthman also served as the scribe occasionally. Many companions committed the Holy Quran to heart and Uthman was one of them.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Many Huffuz (those who had learnt the Holy Quran by heart) died in the battle of Yamama during the caliphate of Abu Bakr. It was felt that it was necessary that the Holy Quran should be compiled in a book form for the guidance of the people. A compilation was thus prepared, and it was called Mashaf. In the time of the caliphate of Abu Bakr this compilation was kept in the custody of Ayesha. In the time of the caliphate of Umar this compilation was kept in the custody of Hafsa, daughter of Umar. and a wife of the Holy Prophet. In the time of Uthman, Hudhaifa who had been to different parts of the Muslim dominions came to Madina, and reported that the people of different regions had different readings of the Holy Quran. The people of Homs held that their reading of the Holy Quran was correct as they had learnt it from Miqdad an eminent companion. The men of Basra held that their reading was correct as they had learnt it from Abu Musa Ashiari. In Kufa, the people claimed superiority for their reading as they had learnt it from Abdullah bin Masud an authority on the subject. There were thus divergent readings of the Holy Quran. It was stressed that unless some attempt was made to unify the text, that was likely to be a cause of split among the people.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The question was considered by the Majlis-i-Shura, and it was decided that an authoritative standardized text should be compiled and no divergence should be permitted from the standard text. Uthman appointed a Committee comprising: Zaid b Thabit, Abdullah b Zubair, Saeed b Al 'Aas , and Abdur Rahman b Al Harith. This Committee was commissioned to prepare an authorized text. Copies of the Holy Quran in use in various parts of the dominions were collected and compared with the copy in the custody of Hafsa which had been compiled in the time of Abu Bakr. The Committee worked hard. All the discrepancies were reconciled, and an authorized standard edition was prepared. Uthman checked the compilation himself and finally approved it. Copies of this edition were prepared and supplied to all parts of the dominions. All previous copies in use in the various parts of the Muslim dominions were collected and burnt.\\n   </p><p>\\n    This was a measure of great importance and significance, and thereby Uthman did a great service to the cause of Islam. The books revealed to all previous prophets had been corrupted by the followers of the respective prophets. But for the measure undertaken by Uthman, the same fate would have befallen the Holy Quran. Uthman deserves the gratitude of the Muslims by this single service in preserving the Holy Quran in its original form free from any corruption. It is surprising that some of the critics of Uthman made this measure a matter of criticism against Uthman. They urged that the burning of the copies of the Holy Quran with a view to introducing a uniform text was a sacrilege. This criticism is entirely misconceived. The burning of the unauthorized texts could by no stretch of imagination be called a sacrilege. It was on the other hand a most pious act inasmuch as it united the Muslim community on an authoritative and standard text for all times \\n   </p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n    According to the Shariah, the Muslims were enjoined to pay Zakat on their capital assets. In the time of the Holy Prophet, Abu Bakr, and Umar, no Zakat was levied on horses and slaves. Uthman reviewed the position and ordered that Zakat should be levied on horses and slaves as well. This measure was approved by the people in general, but some of the persons hostile to Uthman made it a subject of criticism. They argued that as Zakat had not been levied on horses and slaves by the Holy Prophet, Uthman had violated the Sunnah by levying such Zakat.\\n   </p><p>\\n    During the earlier period there was a great dearth of horses. Most of the horses had been killed in early battles. In the time of Uthman things had changed. With the expansion of the Muslim dominions the supply of horses had considerably improved, and the population of horses had increased. The position regarding slaves was similar. With the expansion of the Muslim dominions the number of slaves had considerably increased, and the people owning slaves were deriving much advantage from them. Indeed the slaves were great assets for their masters, and they played an important role in economy.\\n   </p><p>\\n    As a matter of fact Zakat is leviable on all capital assets. In the time of the Holy Prophet horses and slaves had not acquired the dimensions of capital assets and as such these were not assessed to Zakat. As in the time of Uthman these things had become definite capital assets, Uthman subjected them to the levy of Zakat. Such levy was in accord with the spirit of Islam, and was in no way repugnant thereto. Where any articles were not subjected to Zakat because of special circumstances, and these articles were later subjected to the levy as the special circumstances necessitating exemption no longer obtained, such levy was not repugnant to the injunctions of Islam. The levy would have been repugnant if the Holy Prophet had ordered the levy, and such levy was withdrawn. The levy of Zakat on horses and slaves was based on Uthman's Ijtihad. and his Iihhad was correct and in public interest.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In the time of Uthman, a question arose whether Zakat should be assessed by the person concerned or it should be assessed by the State functionaries. Uthman's view was that Zakat was not a tax; it was a species of religious obligation and was a matter between the person concerned and God. Uthman, therefore, held that while the Zakat should be assessed by the person concerned himself, it should be collected by the state functionaries.\\n   </p>"

Many other persons suffered likewise and in the Arab annals this year came to be known as the year of the hemorrhage. Uthman was not able to perform the Hajj during the first year of his office, but in subsequent years he performed the Hajj and presided at the Hajj functions.\\n   </p><p>\\n    When offering the prayers on the occasion of the Hajj between Mina and Mt Arafat, the Holy Prophet had shortened the prayers from four rakaats to two rakaats. Thereafter Abu Bakr and Umar while presiding at the Hajj functions followed the precedent set up by the Holy Prophet, and offered only two rakaats in prayers. In the early years of- his caliphate, Uthman followed the same precedent, but in the year 649 C.E. Uthman offered the full prayers in four rakaats.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman was criticized by hostile circles for making this departure from the precedent set up by the Holy Prophet. Even such companions like Abdur Rahman b Auf and Ali questioned Uthman about the advisability of such innovation. Uthman argued that as a matter of fact the prayer comprised four rakaats, and it could be shortened to two rakaats under special circumstances. When the Holy Prophet shortened the prayer, he had settled at Madina, and had come to Makkah as a visitor. Uthman said that his case was different. He had married in Makkah and had a house there. He also had some property at Taif. As such when he came to Makkah his status was not that of a mere visitor. As such he did not feel himself entitled to enjoy the concession of shortening the prayers. He also argued that in case he continued the practice of shortening the prayers, the Bedouins were apt to feel that the prayers comprised two rakaats only. In order to remove such impression it was necessary that the prayer should be offered in full. Uthman further argued that the shortening of the prayer was a concession. A concession was in principle meant to meet certain exigencies, and had to be withdrawn when such exigencies no longer existed. Uthman held that according to his Ijtihad, a stage had reached when the concession was no longer necessary, and the prayer should be offered in full. Uthman also elaborated that the offering of the prayers in full was in no way repugnant to the injunctions of Islam or Sunnah. If Islam had provided for four rakaats and he had offered two rakaats that would have been repugnant to Islam. Where Islam provided for four rakaats and gave the option of shortening the prayer in certain circumstances, and he chose to offer the prayer in full and not to avail of the concession, such an act was in furtherance of the purposes of Islam, and was in no way repugnant thereto.\\n   </p>"

Uthman levied the Zakat on some of the items which had escaped taxation previously. Ushr was a ten per cent levy on agricultural land as well as merchandise imported from abroad. Kharaj was a levy on land in conquered territories. The rate of Kharaj was higher than the Ushr. Jizya was a poll tax levied on non-Muslims. Fay was the income from State land. Ghanimah was the booty captured on the occasion of war with the enemy. Four-fifth of the booty was distributed among the soldiers taking part in the war while one-fifth was credited to the State fund. During the time of Uthman the income of the State increased considerably. When 'Amr b Al 'Aas was the Governor of Egypt the complaint against him was that the receipts from Egypt were low. He said that the she-camel could not give more milk. When Abdullah bin Sa'ad was appointed as the Governor, the revenues of the province increased. When confronted with this situation 'Amr b Al 'Aas said, \"Yes, the she-camel has given more milk, but its young ones have been starved.\" This shows that under Uthman the revenues of the State increased. The view of 'Amr b Al 'Aas that the young one of the she - camel had been starved was merely an apologetic way of justifying his own administration\\n   </p>"

Umar had placed a ban on the sale of lands in conquered territories. He had also placed a ban on the movements of the Companions and did not permit them to leave Madina. Uthman was a shrewd businessman and trader. He knew that trade could not flourish under restraints. He was a democrat by temperament, and he therefore withdrew the restrictions that had been imposed by Umar with regard to the sale of land or the movements of the people. Uthman also permitted the eminent Companions to draw loans from the public treasury. The economic reforms introduced by Uthman had a far reaching effect. The Quraish, shrewd businessmen as they were, took full advantage of the liberal policies of Uthman, and as a consequence their business flourished and they amassed a good deal of fortune. With this wealth they purchased lands in the conquered territories particularly Sawad in Iraq. In the time of Uthman, they did not merely enjoy dominance in political power, they came to enjoy monopoly in economic power as well. When the Companions were allowed the right of free movement and they were allowed the facility of drawing loans from the public treasury, most of the Companions purchased lands in conquered areas. Some of the Companions became the owners of large estates. The policy of Umar was that whatever the Companions had gained during the time of the Holy Prophet was enough for them and that they should live henceforward a retired life, \"hereunder neither the world should see them, nor they should see the world. Uthman had a different view about the role of the Companions. He was of the view that the services of the Companions, the founding fathers of Islam, should be recognized, and facilities should be provided to them so that they might live in comfort in their old age. During the time of Uthman because of the economic measures of Uthman most of the Companions grew very rich. Brisk building activity took place in Madina. Many palatial buildings grew up in the city, and the city expanded a good deal. The economic policies of Uthman though conceived in public interest had serious political repercussions. Economic power came to be concentrated in the hands of a small group. That led to a gulf between the haves and the havenots. Most of the troubles that Uthman had to face were directly or indirectly due to the economic measures of Uthman which led to the creation of a class which monopolized economic power. This led to some imbalance in Islamic society committed to an egalitarian order. We cannot blame Uthman for these economic measures. His policies aimed at the economic development of the country, and no person can be blamed for promoting economic prosperity. Difficulties arose because some of the persons grew rich overnight, and no institutions were devised to regulate the proper flow of wealth. That provided an opportunity to some of the Muslims like Abu Dhar Ghaffari who stood for an austere way of life to criticize Uthman and his administration. If all these facts are assessed objectively the conclusion that emerges is that Uthman was in advance of his age, and he devised measures for which instead of being praised and admired he was criticized and even maligned.\\n   </p>"

Apart from the meager allowance that had been sanctioned in his favor Umar took no money from the treasury. He did not receive any gifts, nor did he allow any of his family members to accept any gift from any quarter. It appears that during the time of Uthman there was some relaxation in such strictness. In Kufa a dispute arose between Sa'ad b Abi Waqas and the treasurer Abdullah b. Masud over a certain amount which Sa'ad b. Waqas as Governor had taken as a loan from the treasury, and which he was not able to repay within the stipulated period. A similar dispute arose between Walid b Uqba the successor of Sa'ad b Abi Waqas and Abdullah b Mas'l\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman did not draw any allowance from the treasury for performing the functions of the caliphate. He was a wealthy man with sufficient resources of his own, and he had no need to draw any allowance from the treasury. There were, however, some complaints that Uthman was not as strict as his predecessor about the use of public funds. It was alleged that out of the public treasury Uthman made liberal grants to certain favorites. It was also alleged that unlike Umar, Uthman accepted gifts and allowed his family members to accept gifts from certain quarters. Abdullah b Arqam was in charge of the treasury at Madina, and according to some accounts that have come down to us, it is alleged that he resigned from his office as a protest against Uthman's policies with regard to the utilization of public funds.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The various accounts that have come down to us are prejudiced and biased. Uthman was a very rich man; he was most religious and pious. We cannot therefore, imagine that Uthman was corrupt in any way. He always acted, in a bona fide way. What appears to have happened is that Uthman had his own concept about the public funds, while his critics held an entirely different view on the subject.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Companions like Abu Dhar Ghaffari sponsored the theory that the funds in the public treasury were the property of the Muslims and as such had to be distributed equally among the Muslims. Under the circumstances the Caliph had no authority to make any grant to any person at the cost of the Muslims.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman's view on the other hand was that the amount in the treasury was not the property of the Muslims. After the Muslims had received their due share, all that was in the treasury was the property of God and not of the Muslims. As the Caliph was in charge of the affairs of the State, he was a trustee of such property and he could utilize the funds on his own authority in public interest according to his best judgment. Uthman honestly felt that he had the right to utilize the public funds according to his best judgment, and no one had the right to criticize him for that. Uthman's argument was that if he could not spend the fund at the disposal of the State at his discretion, then what was the fun in being the Caliph?\\n   </p><p>\\n    As all the facts pertaining to the allegations are not available, it is not possible to say with any degree of certainty as to how far Uthman was right, or how far his critics were right. The view of the critics that the funds in the public treasury were the property of the Muslims and not of God does not appear to be correct. As in an Islamic State the State sovereignty vests in God, it follows as a matter of basic principle that all property vests in God. As the Caliph was the Head of Government he obviously had the authority to disburse funds for such purposes as he thought necessary. A Caliph is however not an absolute ruler, and if there is anything wrong with his exercise of discretion he can certainly be called in question. Thus while we can hold that the Caliph had the right to spend the money on his own authority it has also to be conceded that the people had the right to criticize the Caliph in case he had not exercised his discretion properly. At that stage of Islamic polity no machinery had been evolved to take cognizance of such criticism, and give its verdict which should be binding both on the Caliph as well as the people. Thus my personal view is that whatever difficulties arose during the caliphate of Uthman about the administration of the public funds were due more to procedural defects than because of any lapse on the part of Uthman\\n   </p>"

On assuming office, the Governor was required to assemble the people in the main mosque, and read the instrument of instructions before them.\\n   </p><p>\\n    One of the main allegations against Uthman was that he had appointed his relatives as Governors. Another allegation was that he exercised little check over the Governors.\\n   </p><p>\\n    As the Caliph, Uthman had the absolute right to appoint the Governors of provinces at his discretion. In theory this discretion could not be questioned. There was no legal bar to the appointment of relatives as Governors. Abdullah b Sa'ad a foster brother of Uthman had been appointed as the Governor of Egypt by Umar. Uthman merely continued him in office. Uthman consolidated Egypt in one province and placed the enlarged province under the charge of Abdullah b Sa'ad. This was an administrative reform in the right direction, and any criticism against the measure was misplaced.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In Syria, Muawiyah was the Governor under Umar. Uthman allowed him to continue in office. Uthman consolidated Syria into one province. In view of the threat from the Byzantines this reform was necessary and very much in public interest.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In Kufa, Uthman appointed Saad b Abi Waqas as the Governor in the first instance. Saad was not related to Uthman and he made the appointment in deference to the will of Umar. Later Saad was deposed and Uthman appointed his step brother Walid b Uqba as the Governor. Sa'ad was not deposed because Uthman wanted to make room for his step brother. Saad was deposed because of his failure to control the situation, and Walid was appointed because Uthman considered that a young man who enjoyed his confidence could alone deliver the goods in Kufa. Walid justified this selection, and during the first five years of his rule he was most popular with the people of Kufa. Later there was agitation in Kufa, and Uthman deposed him in public interest. As a matter of fact the agitation against Walid was not due to the fact that anything had gone wrong with Walid; the reality was that the people of Kufa being fickle by nature were won over by the conspirators, and wanted a change. Uthman accepted their demand even though he was convinced that Walid was not to be blamed in any way and that during the tenure of his office he had served the people of Kufa to the best of his ability.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In Basra, Abu Musa Asha'ari was deposed at the demand of the people of Basra. Uthman asked the representatives of the people of Basra to suggest a person who could be appointed as their Governor. They said that some young person who enjoyed the confidence of the Caliph should be appointed as the Governor. It was in deference to the wish of the people of Basra that Abdullah b Aamar was appointed as the Governor of Basra. He was a cousin of Uthman and he justified his selection in every way.\\n   </p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n    The Shia writers because of partisan considerations condemn the administration of Uthman in strong terms, and hold him guilty of nepotism. Most of the Sunni writers in order to give an impression of their objectivity and fairness impliedly concede that the charge of nepotism was justified against him. If we examine the issue objectively the allegation stands rebutted. There were twelve provinces in the country, but Uthman as Caliph appointed his relatives in four provinces only, namely Egypt, Syria, Kufa and Basra. In the remaining eight provinces persons other than his relatives were appointed. If Uthman was out to give high offices to his relatives, he could have appointed his family members to high offices in the other provinces as well. As he did not do so, the point that is forced to notice is that he appointed his relatives to four provinces not because he wanted to bestow high offices on his family members, but because the strategic importance of these four provinces demanded that in these provinces there should be Governors who were loyal to him and enjoyed his confidence. In the age in which Uthman lived, blood relationship could be the only guarantee for loyalty. It may be appreciated that even in the modern times when the political systems are highly developed, high- offices are bestowed on the members of the parties on the maxim that spoils belong to the victors. In the age of Uthman when the party system was not developed, only blood relations could serve as the party. As such if Uthman appointed some of his relatives as Governors no blame rests on him. He acted in public interest. It may be recalled that when Ali became the Caliph he also appointed his relatives as Governors. No blame rests on Ali for such appointments because what he did was in the best interests of the State. As such we can emphatically state that when Uthman appointed some of his relatives as Governors there was nothing wrong in that.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Some of the writers find fault with Uthman that he appointed incapable persons as Governors. This view is incorrect and uncharitable. All the persons appointed by Uthman were capable persons of great caliber. Muawiyah was a ruler of outstanding capacity, and as a ruler and administrator he was second to none. Abdullah b Sa'ad was successful as Governor. Under his rule the revenues increased manifold. He conquered the whole of North Africa, and that was a great achievement. In Kufa, Walid enjoyed great popularity for the first five years. He conducted successful campaigns in Azarbaijan and Armenia. In Basra Abdullah bin Aamar proved to be most successful. He reconquerd the whole of Fars, Seestan, and Khurasan and even penetrated into Transoxiana. None of the Governors appointed by Uthman proved to be a failure, and it is unjust to condemn Uthman for appointing Governors who made great conquests. Uthman did not make such appointments arbitrarily. He made the appointments after assessing the merits of the persons concerned. It may be recalled that Uthman had brought up Muhammad b Huzaifa as his son. When Muhammad b Huzaifa wanted to be appointed as a Governor, Uthman did not oblige him because he did not consider him fit enough for such office. If nepotism was the sole consideration with Uthman as alleged by his critics he could have appointed Muhammad b Huzaifa to some high office. Muhammad b Huzaifa later led the agitation against Uthman. That clearly establishes that there is no substance in the allegation of nepotism against Uthman.\\n   </p>"

In the accounts that have come down to us, only vague allegations have been made, and no hard and fast facts have been cited to establish what lapses did the Governors of Uthman make anti how Uthman failed to check them. It is made out that these Governors acted according to their own caprices, and did not carry out the orders of Uthman. If the orders of Uthman were not obeyed, Uthman should have been the first person to complain against his Governors. We do not come across in history a single complaint in this connection and it is difficult to subscribe to the view that in the time of Uthman, the administration had become so lax that the Governors did not care for the orders of the Caliph. That appears to be sheer propaganda motivated by partisan considerations. As a matter of fact Uthman was as vigilant as a Caliph could be, and he issued policy guidelines to his Governors from time to time. The true position is that as these Governors enjoyed the confidence of Uthman, he allowed them a good deal of autonomy, and did not interfere in the day to day administration. Umar had imposed some restrictions on his Governors. The Governors had been enjoined not to ride a Turkish horse; not to wear fine clothes; not to eat sifted flour; and not to keep a porter at their door. Uthman did not consider such restrictions necessary and he allowed his Governors greater liberty. This was a step in the right direction and it is unfair to criticize Uthman on this account.\\n   </p>"

As such the people had no right to disobey or criticize the Caliph. If the Caliph was just his reward lay with God.\\n   </p><p>\\n    On the other hand if he was unjust his punishment lay with God. Accordingly when a demand for his deposition was made he turned down the demand not because he was fond of power, but because he held that an office which he held on behalf of God had divinity about it, and he was bound to perform his duties to God whatever the odds. According to Uthman his resignation from an office which he held on behalf of God would amount to his refusal to serve God, and that was against the spirit of Islam. He therefore welcomed death to deposition, and that was certainly most noble and elevating on the part of Uthman. Some writers have indulged in the view that at the last moment, Uthman had agreed to be deposed, but that the rebels did not allow him time to announce his deposition. There is no truth in such stories. Uthman stuck to his view to the last, and he preferred to die rather than abandon the post which he held on behalf of God.\\n   </p><p>\\n    As a matter of principle the view that Uthman held about the caliphate was correct and in conformity with the traditions of the Holy Prophet. The people had no right to demand his deposition and he had no right to resign. The concepts of the so-called democracy and the sovereignty of the people were developed later in secular context. Unfortunately most of the writers, Muslims as well as non-Muslims have tried to judge Uthman in the light of concepts which were developed much later, and which are strictly speaking not in consonance with the spirit of Islam. Uthman acted strictly in accordance with the injunctions of Islam, and who rebelled against his authority were rebels against Islam. As a matter of fact all the allegations that had been levelled against Uthman were frivolous and had no substance. Uthman duly considered these allegations and he explained his position in sufficient detail. After such explanation the people had no right to agitate, and rebel against the authority of the State. That was outright sedition. In his book on Uthman, Taha Hussain has taken pains to establish that most of the complaints against Uthman were justified. I am afraid Mr. Taha Hussain has missed the point that under the Islamic constitutional law the authority to determine how far these complaints were justified was the Caliph himself and when he took cognize Ice of these complaints and explained his position publicly that was the end of the matter, and it does not lie within the competence of any writer, howsoever eminent, to sit in judgement over the conduct of Uthman and hold that most of the complaints against him were justified. My submission is that posterity has no right to sit in judgement over the caliphate of Uthman. Uthman acted to the best of his judgement, and we are precluded from finding any fault with what he did. It may be recalled that on the occasion of the expedition to Tabuk when the Holy Prophet gave the tidings of paradise to Uthman he also said that Uthman was not to be judged for anything thereafter. In view of this verdict of the Holy Prophet, it is not open to any Muslim to sit in judgement over what Uthman did as Caliph, and criticize him for any sins of omission or commission. As a matter of fact the revolt against Uthman was not due to any legitimate grievances of the people; it was due to extraneous cause, and was abetted by foreign powers who wanted to subvert Islam from within. The revolt against Uthman was in fact revolt against Islam. Uthman met a martyr's death in defense of Islam\\n   </p>"

Marwan took objection to these insulting remarks, but Uthman chose to remain quiet. Once when Uthman was addressing the congregation in the mosque and justifying his position, Amr b A1 'Aas  contradicted him, and adopted an insulting stance. 'Amr b A1 ,Aas had a strong party in Egypt and this party created a good deal of trouble for Uthman. When the rioters from Egypt came to Madina they enjoyed the support of 'Amr b A1 'Aas . When the agitation against Uthman grew in momentum, 'Amr b A1 'Aas  left Madina for Palestine. While departing from Madina, 'Arur b Al 'Aas spoke contemptuously about Uthman, and said that he would raise even the shepherds of the desert against Uthman.\\n   </p>"

An exception was made in the case of ten persons who were to be killed for their heinous crimes. Abdullah b Sa'ad was one of these ten persons who were to be killed. Abdullah b Sa'ad sought the protection of Uthman and appealed to him to intercede on his behalf with the Holy Prophet. The foster mother of Uthman appealed to him to save his foster brother. Uthman was reluctant to intercede because under Islam apostasy was a crime punishable with death. On account of the persistent entreaties of his foster mother for whom he had great respect Uthman agreed that he would do whatever he could. Uthman took Abdullah b Sa'ad to the Holy Prophet, and placed him at the mercy of the Holy Prophet. When the request for forgiveness was made the Holy Prophet made no reply. Uthman repeated the request for the second time and still the Holy Prophet remained silent. The request was made for the third time and out of regard for Uthman, the Holy Prophet agreed to spare the life of Abdullah b, Sa'ad. Abdullah repented and craved for forgiveness. He was forgiven and was readmitted to the fold of Islam.\\n   </p>"

The charge of nepotism against Uthman is not correct, because Abdullah had been appointed as Governor by Umar. Uthman merely carried forward the policies that had been laid down by Umar. The charge of nepotism falls to the ground because Abdullah b Sa'ad alone was not related to him 'Amr b A1 'Aas  was also related to him. If Abdullah b Sa'ad was the foster brother of Uthman, 'Amr b A1 'Aas  was a brother-in-law of Uthman as he had married a sister of Uthman. Uthman had no intention to depose 'Amr b Al 'Aas . He wanted him to remain the Governor as well as the supreme military commander; he only wanted him to give independent charge of revenue department to Abdullah b Sa'ad. Abdullah b Sa'ad was an expert in revenue administration and financial management while 'Amr b Al 'Aas was Rood as a military commander. The division of functions proposed by Uthman was sound in principle and was in the best interests of the State. 'Amr b Al 'Aas did not accept the reform because he was interested more in matters of personal prestige than in measures devised in the interests of the State. If in the circumstances, 'Amr b Al 'Aas was deposed, the blame did not lie with Uthman. 'Amr b Al 'Aas was himself to be blamed for the crisis.\\n   </p>"

Some well wishers tried to intervene, but no way could be found to resolve the crisis. Sa'ad b Abi Waqas pleaded his inability to repay the loan immediately, while Ibn Masud pleaded his inability to allow any extension. The crisis deepened, and ultimately Uthman had no option but to depose Sa'ad b Abi Waqas from the Governorship of Kufa. Some of the malcontents made this order a matter of criticism against Uthman. It was contended that as there were two parties to the dispute, penal action should have been taken against both the parties and not against one of them only. It was argued that Uthman had unduly favored Ibn Masud who was originally a slave of his step father Uqba b Abi Mo'eet. If the facts of the case are considered dispassionately, it would be seen that there was no dereliction on the part of Ibn Masud. He merely insisted on the repayment of the loan according to the terms governing the grant of the loan. Ibn Masud merely performed his duty as the custodian of the Bait-ul-Mal, and there could be no justification for penalizing him for performing his duty zealously.\\n   </p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n     On the deposition of Sa'ad b Abi Waqas from the governorship of Kufa, Uthman appointed Walid b Uqba as the Governor of Kufa. Walid b Uqba was an uterine brother of Uthman. After the death of Affan the father of Uthman, his mother Urwa had married Uqba b Abi Mo'eet. Uqba b Abi Mo'eet was one of the inveterate enemies of Islam. Among the Quraish he was in the forefront in the persecution of the Muslims. He was taken captive by the Muslims in the battle of Badr and was executed.\\n   </p><p>\\n     Walid became a Muslim at the time of the conquest of Makkah. Thereafter he was commissioned by the Holy Prophet to collect taxes from the Banu Mustaliq tribe. When Walid reached the settlement of the Banu Mustaliq they came out in large numbers to meet him. He got the impression that the Banu Mustaliq meant some mischief. He returned to Madina and reported to the Holy Prophet that the Banu Mustaliq had apostatized and were not willing to pay the taxes.\\n   </p><p>\\n     Later it transpired that the impression of Walid was false. The Banu Mustaliq had not apostatized, on the other hand they had gathered in strength to greet him as an emissary of the Government of Madina. The Holy Prophet felt annoyed at the conduct of Walid. On this occasion a verse of the Holy Quran was revealed enjoining the Muslims that when any news was reported, they should verify it in the first instance.\\n   </p><p>\\n     Walid was, however, intelligent and a man of considerable ability. Later he made amends for his lapse in the matter of the collection of taxes from Banu Mustaliq, and his services were utilized for sundry purposes. Umar a great connoisseur of men employed him for the collection of taxes from the Banu Taghlib tribe in Jazira and he discharged his duties most conscientiously.\\n   </p><p>\\n     When Uthman became the Caliph, Walid came to Madina and remained by the side of Uthman. In his book on Uthman, Raza Misri relates that once when Walid came to Uthman he took his particular seat, but when Hakam b Al A'as the uncle of Uthman came Uthman vacated his own seat for his uncle. Thereupon Walid b Uqba composed the verses:\\n   </p><p>\\n     \"I have seen what respect one's uncle commands;\\n   </p><p>\\n     And before the uncle the stature of the brother is diminished:\\n   </p><p>\\n     Perhaps the brother's fault is that he is young in age;\\n   </p><p>\\n     I hope that in course of time 'Amr and Khalid (sons of Uthman) would respect me as uncle as Uthman respects his uncle Hakam.\"\\n   </p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n     Walid b Uqba remained the Governor of Kufa for a period of five years and during this period he was very popular among the people and there were no complaints against him.\\n   </p><p>\\n     Thereafter the events took a sudden turn, and the position of Walid as Governor became uneasy. One night some young men beat to death a citizen of Kufa, Ibn Hesiman Khuzaii by name. Three young men Zubair b Jandab Azdi; Mawan b Abi Lawah Asadi; and Shabilb Abi Al Azdi were accused of the murder. Abu Sharih Khuzaii and his son who were the neighbors of Ibn Hesiman watched the murder from their house.\\n   </p><p>\\n     When the case was reported to Walid he held a public trial. The details of the case are not known. We do not know what was the cause of the dispute between the murdered person and his murderers. The only eye witnesses of the tragedy were Abu Sharih Khuzaii and his son. They narrated that they heard Ibn Hesiman cry for help. Thereupon the murderers had said to him, \"Do not cry for one stroke of the sword will suffice for you.\" As Abu Sharih and his son had watched the tragedy from some distance in the dark they were not in a position to fully recognize the murderers\\n   </p><p>\\n     In view of this shortcoming in the evidence, the heirs of the murdered were asked to declare on fifty oaths as required by the injunctions of the Shariah, that the persons accused of the murder were really the murderers of Ibn Hesiman. They took the prescribed fifty oaths, and Walid gave the verdict that the accused were guilty of murder. The death sentence was referred to Uthman for confirmation, and when the confirmation orders were received the three accused persons were hanged.\\n   </p><p>\\n     Thereupon 'Amr b 'Asim Tamimi composed the following verse:\\n   </p><p>\\n     \"O mischief mongers do not murder your neighbors like this,\\n   </p><p>\\n     During the caliphate of Uthman;\\n   </p><p>\\n     Beware that the Caliph would penalize the miscreants According to the injunctions of Islam;\\n   </p><p>\\n     For verily Uthman always acts,\\n   </p><p>\\n     In accordance with the commands of the Holy Quran\\n   </p><p>\\n     Which regulates the conduct of the Muslims in all matters\\n   </p><p>\\n     While the general public felt satisfied at the execution of the murderers, the fathers of the three murderers namely Jandab Azdi, Abi Lawah Asadi, and Abi Al Azdi felt dissatisfied. Their grouse was that the charge of murder had not been established against their sons and that Walid had executed them as he had some personal grudge against them. They carried on propaganda against the Governor, and they were able to win some persons to their cause. The party worked underground, and their secret agents spied on Walid with a view to ascertain his weaknesses and defame him\\n   </p><p>\\n     As a result of the working of this party, Walid came to be accused of some imaginary grievances. When Walid was the Collector in Jazira he had come across Abu Zubayd Taii a poet of great eminence. As Walid was also a poet, he freely associated with Abu Zubayd. Abu Zubayd was a Christian and he was given to drinking. While in Jazira there was no complaint that Walid had associated with Abu Zubayd in any drinking but Abu Zubayd had to pay some loan and he was not in a position to clear his debt. Walid came to the help of Abu Zubayd by repaying the loan out of his own pocket. That made Abu Zubayd indebted to Walid. When Walid became the Governor of Kufa, Abu Zubayd came to Kufa and stayed with Walid as his guest. At the instance of Walid, Abu Zubayd became a Muslim. He wrote some verses in the praise of Islam. During the nights Walid and Abu Zubayd spent long hours together talking on literary matters. The conspirators whipped up a campaign that during the nights Abu Zubayd and Walid indulged in drinking. Some persons secretly raided the house of Walid to catch hold of some liquor but they found nothing objectionable.\\n   </p><p>\\n     A sorcerer appeared in Kufa who claimed that he could enter through the body of an ass from its tail and come out from its mouth. Walid asked the sorcerer to give a public demonstration of his feat. The conspirators whipped up a vilification campaign against Walid. They were critical that the Governor was patronizing sorcery. On the occasion of the public demonstration the conspirators appeared in large number, and raised the cry that the demonstration was unlslamic. They rushed at the sorcerer and killed him, thereupon Walid apprehended the murderers of the sorcerer and put them in jail. The case was reported to Uthman. He directed that the murderers be released, and warned not to take the law in their hands. On release the conspirators intensified their campaign of vilification against Walid. They changed their tactics. They began to associate with Walid, and pretended that they were sorry for the past misunderstandings and that in future they would be faithful and loyal to him. Walid took them at their word. These persons amused Walid with their anecdotes and stories One night these persons kept awake till late hours telling him some interesting stories. When overpowered by sleep Walid dozed, they took of the official ring from his finger and departed for Madina.\\n   </p><p>\\n     In Madina they complained before Uthman that Walid was guilty of intoxication. In evidence of the charge that in a fit of intoxication Walid had thrown away his official ring. They also charged that Walid led the prayers in a state of intoxication, and in the state of such unconsciousness he offered four rakaats in the morning prayers instead of the Prescribed two rakaats\\n   </p>"

It is stated that Uthman counseled Walid to bear the hardship with patience. According to one account Ali asked his son Hasan to flog Walid. Hasan refused to do so.

The tale appears to have been embroidered both by those who were critical of Uthman, and those who wanted to defend. Those who were hostile to Uthman took pains to establish that the person appointed by Uthman to high offices was guilty of heinous crimes, and hence Uthman was guilty of appointing undeserving person to high offices.\\n   </p><p>\\n     On the other hand those who stood for the defense of Uthman, and wanted to show that Uthman was just and impartial, held that even when a brother of Uthman was found guilty, Uthman did not hesitate to subject him to the penalty of law.\\n   </p><p>\\n     As a matter of fact, the accounts that have come down to us with regard to this episode do not stand the test of historical scrutiny. The case against Walid was not established, and according to the norms of justice he could not be penalized on the ground of mere hearsay or the evidence of interested witnesses. During his five years rule Walid had been most popular. Only a few persons conspired against him, and it is inconceivable that such high functionary of the State should have been publicly disgraced merely because of a conspiracy against him when the charge was not established.\\n   </p><p>\\n     Walid had the support of the Bani Umayya, and they were in sufficient strength and power.

One night when Saeed held his usual meeting with these persons, a reference was made to the liberality and generosity of Talha bin Ubaidullah. It was said that Talha was very liberal in cir,~rity, and he distributed thousands of dirhams among the poor every week. Saeed said that Talha b Ubaidullah owned a very large estate \"Nashsta;\", which brought him very large income and as such he could indulge in manifestations of charity. Saeed added that if he were an estate holder, his generosity would surpass the generosity of Talha. Thereupon one of the persons in the gathering, Khanis b Falan Asadi said, \"I wish you owned the royal Persian estate in Iraq '`Maltat\", so that you could give us the manifestation of your generosity. There was some further talk on the subject, and thereafter the tempers flared up. These people felt that Khanis was inciting Saeed to acquire the estate of Maltat. Their view was that this estate should be distributed among the people. That led to an altercation, and Khanis was given a good beating.\\n   </p><p>\\n     On another occasion Saeed in an unwary moment said that Sawad (the area between the Tigris and the Euphrates) was the garden of the Quraish. These people protested in strong terms. They said that this area in Iraq belonged to Iraq anu the (2uraisll had no right to dominate over the people of lraq in that way.

    "text": "<p>\\n     In Syria, Amir Muawiyah tried to deal with these conspirators diplomatically. He provided them with various facilities, and conferred many favors on them. He held several sittings with them, and tried to make them see reasons. The conspirators continued their campaign of vilification against the Quraish, and even demanded the deposition of Amir Muawiyah. Amir Muawiyah reported the matter to Uthman and he directed that these men be sent to Jazira where the ruler was Abdur Rahman.\\n   </p><p>\\n     Abdur Rahman was the son of the famous General Khalid b Walid. He treated with these conspirators harshly. The strong measures adopted by Abdur Rahman had a salutary effect, and the conspirators offered repentance. Abdur Rahman sent one of these conspirators Ashtar to Madina, and sent a message to Uthman through him that as they had repented they might be allowed to return to Kufa.\\n   </p><p>\\n     In Madina, Ashtar saw Uthman, and offered repentance on his own behalf, and on behalf of the other conspirators. At that time Saeed b A1 'Aas  was also in Madina. Uthman accepted the repentance of Ashtar and the other conspirators, and allowed them to return to Kufa.\\n   </p><p>\\n     Ashtar and the other conspirators returned to Kufa, while Saeed was still in Madina. Back in Kufa, the conspirators violated their pledge, and once again resorted to a campaign of vilification. This time Saeed b Al'Aas  was the main target of criticism. Addressing the people at the gate of the main mosque in Kufa, Ashtar said that he had been to Madina, where he had come to know that Saeed b Al 'Aas had recommended to Uthman that strong measures should be taken against the people of Kufa. They were to be enslaved and deported and their properties were to be confiscated.\\n   </p><p>\\n     The deputy that Saeed b Al 'Aas had left at Kufa tried to explain to the people that all this talk of enslavement and confiscation of properties was false, and there was no such move in any quarter. The people paid no heed to him and raised slogans demanding the deposition of Saeed b Al 'Aas . The persons who were pro-Government had to remain confined to their houses, while the streets of Kufa came to be flocked by agitators vociferous in their demand for the deposition of Saeed b Al'Aas .\\n   </p><p>\\n     Over one thousand persons from Kufa decided to go to Madina to place their demand before Uthman. Uthman listened to them at Madina. He tried to explain to them that all their grievances were imaginary, and Saeed b Al 'Aas had made no recommendation to which they were objecting. They, however, stuck test to their demand for the deposition of Saeed b Al 'Aas . Uthman felt that argument with the rebels was of no avail. In order to pacify them he said, \"If you do not want Saeed as your Governor, whom do you want?\" They said, \"Abu Musa Ashari may be appointed as our Governor.\" Uthman said, \"All right, I accept your demand in the interests of peace although I know that no blame rests on Saeed b Al 'Aas . I depose him and appoint Abu Musa Ashari as your Governor. Now go back and be at peace. Now that I have given you the Governor of your own choice, obey him, and let there be no more of unnecessary agitation\".\\n   </p><p>\\n     This action of Uthman has been made the subject of criticism in some quarters. There is one school of thought which is critical of Uthman for making a wrong choice in the appointment of Governors. As a matter of fact there was nothing wrong with the appointment of Saeed b Al 'Aas . He was a talented young man whose talents had been acknowledged by Umar. Saeed won brilliant victories in Tabaristan, and that was a feather in his cap.\\n   </p><p>\\n     The other school of thought criticizes Uthman for deposing Saeed when he was not at fault. Although Saeed was not at fault there was nevertheless strong agitation against him, right or wrong. In such circumstances if Saeed was to continue in office, it meant the imposition of a Governor on the people whom they did not want. In the circumstances, in the interests of public administration, the only course open to Uthman was to recall Saeed from Kufa and appoint in his stead the man they wanted. Uthman hoped that by such action he would take the wind out of the sails of the rebels\\n   </p>"

During the year 647 C.E. there were some disturbances in Fars, and some forces had to be sent there to restore law and order. There was shortage of animals at the time, and addressing the people Abu Musa stressed the virtue of undertaking Jihad on foot. The people were impressed with the preaching of Abu Musa Ash'ari, and they volunteered to undertake Jihad on foot in case there was a shortage of animals.\\n   </p><p>\\n     When on the scheduled date, Abu Musa Ashari came out of his palace to lead the people to battle, he rode on a richly caprisoned horse, and his camp equipage was loaded on forty pack animals. The people flared up at this display of luxury on the part of Abu Musa Ash'ari, and the dichotomy in what he preached and what he practiced. Some of the persons held the reins of the horse of Abu Musa Ash'ari and said: \"Alight and walk with us on foot, or furnish us horses as well to ride.\" That annoyed Abu Musa Ash'ari. Harsh words were exchanged between Abu Musa As~h'ari and some of the persons, and he had some persons lashed for their insolence. The reaction of the people to this act on the part of the Governor was violent. They refused to march to the battlefield under his leadership, who did not practice what he preached.\\n   </p><p>\\n     A deputation representing the people of Basra left for Madina, and there they lodged a complaint before Uthman against the conduct of Abu Musa Ash'ari. The news writer from Basra also sent a report which was not favorable to the Governor. Abu Musa had held the office of the Governor for over six years, and because of the length of the term of office he had come to develop a sort of superiority complex which created a gulf between the people and the Governor. Abu Musa Ashari had grown in years, and was prone to prefer a life of ease. Uthman gave a patient hearing to the deputationists. They pressed the need of deposing Abu Musa Ashari from his office. Uthman after hearing all the complaints against Abu Musa Ash'ari came to the conclusion that he was not guilty of any dishonesty or dereliction of duty. He, however, felt that Abu Musa had held the office for long, and it was in public interest that there should be a change. He asked the deputationists: \"In case Abu Musa is removed, whom would you like to be Governor?\" They said that any young man in whom the Caliph had confidence would be better than the old Abu Musa Ash'ari. Uthman thereupon passed orders deposing Abu Musa Ashiari form the governorship of Basra, and appointing Abdullah b Aamar in his place.\\n   </p>"

Soon after assuming charge as Governor, Abdullah b 'Aamir embarked on a campaign of extensive conquests. He first undertook campaigns in the province of Fars. After suppressing revolts in Fars, Abdullah b 'Aamir undertook campaigns in Kirman. The command of the forces in Kirman was entrusted to Mujasshaa b Musa Salmi. Kirman was soon reconquered. Campaigns were next undertaken in Seestan. Rabeah b Ziyad Harithi was appointed to command the forces in Seestan. Seestan was reconquered. Thereafter Afghanistan was conquered, and the borders of India were reached. Theteafter Abdullah b 'Aamir led the Muslim forces in person in Khurasan the Muslim forces captured the forts which were the gates of Khurasan. Thereafter Abdullah b 'Aamir led the Muslim forces to Quhistan. Ouhistan was conquered after some fighting. Ibn 'Aamir sent numerous columns in various dlrections. One column conquered the territory of Rustaqzam in Nishapur. Another column conquered the area of Bakharz. Another column conquered the area of luban. Another column under Aswad b Kulthum Adwi was sent against Bahaq. Aswad was killed in action, but the city was conquered by the Muslims. Thereafter other cities in Nishapur were brought under control. Thereafter the city of Abushahr was reduced after a long siege. Thereafter Nishapur was conquered. It n 'Aarnir appointed Qais b Hatim Salmi as the ruler of Nishapur. Ibn 'Aamir sent another column under Abdullah b Khazam Salmi to Nasaa The city was conquered and the peace was negotiated on the usual terms. The next campaign was against Sarakhs which fell to the Muslims after some fighting. From Sarakhs one column advanced to Kaif and another to Bina. Both the cities were conquered after some fighting. Tus was next to fall. Columns were thereafter sent to Herat, Badghes, and Bushang which cities also fell to the Muslims. The cities of Taghun and Yaghun fell after some fighting. Thereafter the Muslim forces advanced to Merv. The ruler of Merv surrendered and agreed to pay tribute. Another column advanced to Taghiristan which country was conquered after some fighting. Next the territory of Mervroz was captured. A column under Aqraa b Habis Tamimi was sent to Juzjan. The territory of Juzjan was conquered by the Muslims after a good deal of fighting. The territories of Talqan and Faryab were next conquered. The Muslims thereafter advanced to Balkh which city was captured after a siege lasting for some time.\\n   </p><p>\\n     Thereafter Abdullah b 'Aamir crossed the Oxus, and subdued a greater part of Transoxiana. After these conquests Abdullah b 'Aamir returned to Nishapur. The achievements of Abdullah b 'Aamir were most astounding. Within a few years he had conquered Fars, Kirman, Seestan, Kabul, Khurasan and a greater part of Transoxiana. The conquests exceeded the conquests made by any other conqueror in history.\\n   </p><p>\\n     After the successful completion of his campaigns, Abdullah b Aamir donned the 17'ram in Nishapur, and proceeded to the Ka'aba to perform the Hajj and offer thanks to God. After performing the Hajj, Abdullah b 'Aamir proceeded to Madina to see Uthman. Before Abdullah b 'Aamir reached Madina, Uthman had been martyred. That was a great shock for Abdullah b 'Aamir. When Zubair, Talha, and Ayesha raised the call for the vengeance for the blood of Uthman, Abdullah b 'Aamir joined them.

In the \"Battle of the Camel\" which was fought in December 656, the confederates were defeated and Basra was captured by Ali.\\n   </p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n     In most of the accounts that have come down to us, Marwan b Hakam is painted as the \"evil genius\" who was responsible for the troubles of Uthman. The issue needs objective examination. Marwan was the son of Hakam. Hakam was the paternal uncle of Uthman. When Uthman was converted to Islam, Hakam put considerable pressure on Uthman to retract from his faith in Islam. Uthman remained firm in his faith in Islam, and thereafter Hakam left Uthman to himself. Hakam and his son Marwan were converted to Islam at the time of the conquest of Makkah. Hakam and Marwan then came to Madina. In Madina, the Holy Prophet felt annoyed at the conduct of Hakam and exiled him to Taif. Marwan consequently came to be called \"Ibn Tarid\", the son of the expelled one. It is reported that Uthman interceded with the Holy Prophet for the recall of Hakam from exile. The Holy Prophet agreed to rescind the orders of exile, but before the orders were passed the Holy Prophet was dead. In the time of Abu Bakr and Umar, Uthman requested for the recall of Hakam. As no evidence other than the evidence of Uthman was available to the effect that the Holy Prophet had agreed to rescind the orders of exile, the Caliphs did not agree to recall Hakam from exile. When Uthman became the Caliph he recalled Hakam from exile. As Caliph, Uthman was competent to act on the basis of information available to him. In some quarters, Uthman was criticized for rescinding the order passed by the Holy Prophet. Uthman dec1ared that the Holy Prophet had agreed to his recall. Uthman was not the man to speak a lie and whatever he said must be true. The orders of exile were recalled after more than twelve years and as every sentence must be for a specified period, Uthman was justified in passing the orders of recall after twelve years. Hakam did not stay in Madina for long, and went back to Makkah and Taif. Uthman requested Hakam to leave Marwan at Madina in order to assist him. Marwan accordingly remained at Madina and he acted as Uthman's Minister and Secretary. It cannot be denied that as Caliph Uthman needed assistance in running the affairs of the State. He could appoint only such persons to such office who enjoyed his absolute confidence.\\n   </p><p>\\n     It may be recalled that in the time of Uthman, there were no developed institutions for running the affairs of the State. Loyalties depended on blood relationship and tribal considerations alone. In the circumstances of the age in which he lived Uthman had no option, but to invoke the assistance of his relatives. It is alleged that Uthman allotted one fifth of the revenues of Egypt to Marwan. The allegation is preposterous. If there had been any substance in the allegation Marwan should have been extraordinarily rich. As a matter of fact he was a man of ordinary means, and this shows that no undue payments were made to him. It is probable that some allowances may have been paid to Marwan out of the public funds, but such payment was justified because Marwan served as Minister or Secretary to the Caliph. Marwan is generally painted as the evil genius of Uthman. Sir William Muir has explained in his book regarding the history of the Caliphs that such allegations are based on partisan motives and are void of substance. It is made out that on several occasions Ali gave his mind to Uthman and Uthman promised to follow the advice of Ali, but that on the advice of Marwan, Uthman would again revert to his objectionable ways. All such allegations were made with a view to projecting Uthman as a man of fickle and feeble character who had no will of his own, and was led by the nose by unscrupulous advisers. As a matter Ã¹ of fact, Uthman was neither feeble nor fickle, nor were his advisers unscrupulous. They were as good Muslims as other persons, and they served the State as best as they could.\\n   </p>"

It is related that the delegation which came from Egypt merely complained against Abdullah b Sa'ad the Governor of Egypt. Uthman wrote a strong letter to Abdullah b Sa 'ad to redress the grievances of the people. It is alleged that Abdullah b Sa'ad instead of redressing the grievances of the people scourged the persons who had complained against him, and had one of them executed. Thereupon the Egyptians came to Madina for the second time. They saw some of the Companions, and explained their grievances to them. It is reported that Talha b Ubaidullah saw Uthman and spoke some harsh words to him about the laxity of his administration. Ayesha is also reported to have criticized Uthman. Ali is reported to have advised Uthman to depose Abdullah b Sa'ad from the Governorship of Egypt. Uthman agreed to the demand, and wanted the Egyptians to name the person whom they wanted to be appointed as the Governor of Egypt. They suggested Muhammad b Abu Bakr, and Uthman passed orders deposing Abdullah b Sa'ad and appointing Muhammad b Abu Bakr in his place. The Egyptians felt satisfied at this order and they returned to Egypt. After they had proceeded a few stages from Madina they came across a slave of Uthman. On search he was found carrying a letter to Abdullah b Sa'ad not to give effect to the orders of deposition passed against him. He was instructed to put the rioters to death. That made the Egyptians return to Madina. They saw Ali and Ali took them to Uthman. Uthman took a solemn oath denying all knowledge about the letter. It was suspected that the letter was in the hand of Marwan. The Egyptians wanted that Marwan should be handed over to them. Uthman refused, and thereupon the rioters besieged Uthman in his house. The siege lasted for some days and ultimately Uthman was martyred. It is alleged that when Ali heard of the murder of Uthman he said that he wanted the murder of Marwan and not that of Uthman. This account tends to give the impression that Uthman lost his life because he showed undue favor to Marwan\\n   </p><p>\\n     Research has established that the story about the alleged letter is a concocted story, and is remote from reality. It appears from Tabari that when the rioters came to Madina, Abdullah be Sa'ad was ousted from power by a revolt led by Muhammad b Abi Hudhaifa. Muhammad b Abi Hudhaifa was opposed to Uthman, and as such there was no occasion to require that the rioters should be murdered.\\n   </p><p>\\n     Even if the story of the letter were true, Marwan who was the Minister could not be handed over to the rioters merely because they suspected that he had written the letter. Marwan could not be condemned unless a regular trial was held and he was found guilty. If the rioters had demanded the trial of Marwan, Othrnan would have agreed to such a trial, but he could not hand over a high functionary of the State to the fury of the rioters without trial.\\n   </p>"

Abdullah b Sa'ad kept one fifth of the State share of the booty for himself, and sent the rest to Madina through Marwan b Al Hakam.\\n   </p><p>\\n    When the news of the victory of Subetula reached Madina, the Muslims rejoiced and Uthman led a prayer of thanksgiving. When Marwan b Al Hakam reached Madina with the booty, he prevailed upon Uthman to sell the entire booty to him for five lakhdinars. Uthman was in a generous mood, and he conceded to the request of Marwan. According to some accounts even the amount of five lakh diners was paid by Uthman out of his own pocket.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The people felt bitter at the disposal of the booty in this way. The people were also critical of the award of one fifth of the State share of the booty to Abdullah b Sa'ad. A delegation from Egypt came to Madina to see the Caliph. They complained against the misappropriation of the booty by Abdullah b Sa'ad. Uthman said that there was no misappropriation as he had himself announced that in case Abdullah b Sa'ad was victorious he would get one fifth out of the state share as his reward. The delegation said that even if it was so, there was no justification for such a high reward to Abdullah b Sa'ad. The battle was won through the feat of Abdullah b Zubair, and there was nothing conspicuous about the services of Abdullah b Sa'ad.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman said that if the people of Egypt felt dissatisfied at the grant of the reward, he could ask Abdullah b Sa'ad to return it. The delegation said that the people of Egypt were very bitter at the grant of the reward. Thereupon Uthman wrote to Abdullah b Sa'ad that the share of the booty kept by him should be distributed by him among the poor in Egypt.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The delegation demanded that as they had complained against Abdullah b Sa'ad, he was prone to be vindictive, and as such he should be deposed. Uthman said that as Abdullah b Sa'ad was not to be blamed for anything, there was no justification for his deposition. He, however, wrote to Abdullah b Sa'ad that he should not take any action against the members of the delegation for having made a complaint against him.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Unfortunately the account that has reached us is distorted and confused. Extensive conquests had been made under Abdullah b Saad and immense booty had fallen to the share of each person. Abdullah b Saad who had the Muslims to victory must have been very popular with the soldiers, and it is difficult to believe that immediately in the wake of the victory, the soldiers should be dissatisfied against their commander who had led them to victory and send a delegation to Madina to complain against him. Again it is unbelievable that the Head of the State should promise a reward for a certain achievement, and rescind the order when the achievement is made, merely because certain person chooses to represent against such reward. Obviously these stories have been concocted because of partisan considerations merely to condemn the administration of Uthman on one pretext or the other.\\n   </p>"

It means that when in 711-712 C.E. regular campaigns were undertaken for the conquest of Spain by Tariq b Ziyad and Musa b Naseer the Muslims were already familiar with Spain, and such familiarity helped in the process of conquest.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Another point which emerges from this account is that Uthman contemplated the conquest of Constantinople via Spain. At that time there were only two great powers in the ancient world namely the empire of Persia, and the\\n   </p><p>\\n    empire of the Byzantines. The empire of Persia was completely subjugated during the time of Uthman. Syria, Palestine, Egypt and North Africa were wrested from the Byzantines, but the Byzantines still held Constantinople, Asia Minor and some parts of Europe. It appears that Uthman contemplated the complete subjugation of the Byzantine empire as well and his strategy was to launch a two pronged attack against Constantinople one from the east via Syria and Asia Minor and the other from the west via Spain. The attack from the west envisaged the subjugation of the continent of Europe. If there had been no internal dissension within the ranks of the Muslims, Uthman was likely to have embarked on his ambitious plan of the conquest of Europe and Constantinople.\\n   </p><p>\\n    When the Muslims completely subjugated Persia during the caliphate of Uthman, and when the Muslims after conquering North Africa succeeded in getting a foothold in Spain, the Byzantines must have felt alarmed at the rising tide of the Muslims. It may also be borne in mind that Umar had forbidden the Muslims to venture across the seas, but Uthman had withdrawn that restriction. During the time of Uthman the Muslims beat the Byzantines on the sea several times. During the time of Uthman the situation had thus become very critical for the Byzantines In open warfare the Byzantines were no match for the Muslims. The Byzantines therefore encouraged schemes for the subversion of Islam from within. It appears to me that those who conspired against Uthman were really playing in the hands of the Byzantines and other foreign powers. Uthman beat the enemy on the battle ground but he could not beat them in the matter of intrigues and underhand subversive activities.\\n   </p>"

All leaders among the Persians who were guilty of instigating the revolt were hunted out and executed.\\n   </p><p>\\n    With the fall of Persepolis, other cities in Fars also submitted unconditionally. Thus the Muslims once again became the masters of Fars. Uthman appointed Shareek b Aaor Harithi as the governor of Fars. Shareek restored law and order. He sent missionaries of Islam to various cities. Shareek's analysis of the situation was that the Persians had revolted for they still followed their old religion, and that the only way to peace was that the people should be converted to   Islam, so that they were cut off from their old associations. As a result of the efforts of the Muslim missionaries conversions to Islam took place on a large scale. Under the orders of Uthman, mosques were built in the various cities of Fars, and these became the centers for the promotion of Islam.\\n   </p>"

Palatial buildings had sprung up, and the city had expanded up to the hill of \"Sala'a\". Abu Dhar Ghifari stayed in the Prophet's mosque, and addressing the people he said, \"O the people of Madinah, you have departed from the ways of the Holy Prophet. You are after amassing wealth; you have raised palatial buildings, and have become the victims of luxury. I give you the tidings of troubled times that lie ahead, for the Holy Prophet said that when the city expanded to the Sala'a hill there would be trouble for the people.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman saw Abu Dhar Ghifari, and pointed to him the fallacy in his view point. He pointed out that Islam condemned asceticism and monasticism. Islam stood for both this world and the world hereafter. Islam stood for a proper synthesis between this world and the next world. As such it was not advisable that what was in the Baitul Mal should be distributed immediately among the people. Money had to be necessarily kept for meeting the needs of the administration and the requirements of the State. The State was under an obligation that the real needs of the people were met. Uthman pointed out that he had raised the stipends of the people, and these were enough to meet their needs. Some persons were critical that he had been lavish in raising the amount of the stipends. Uthman made out the point that in the circumstances to preach the doctrine that nothing should be kept in the state treasury and should be distributed immediately was not only unpractical, it was dangerous as well.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ka'ab Ahbar an eminent companion who was also present on the occasion joined in the discussion. He observed that it was inadvisable to condemn the rich for hoarding. The obligation on them was to pay Zakat, and after they had paid Zakat they could use their money in any way they liked and they could not be condemned for hoarding money or violating any injunctions of Islam. Abu Dhar Ghifari did not agree with this view. Hot words were exchanged between Abu Dhar Ghifari and Ka'ab Ahbar. In a fit of fury Abu Dhar Ghifari struck Ka'ab Ahbar with his staff. Uthman took strong notice of this conduct on the part of Abu Dhar Ghifari and said, \"O Abu Dhar may God have mercy on you; hold your tongue and your hand\".\\n   </p><p>\\n    Abu Dhar Ghifari thereupon wanted permission to live outside Madinah. Uthman permitted him to live wherever he liked. Abu Dhar Ghifari chose Rabza as the place of his residence. Uthman sanctioned a stipend for Abu Dhar Ghifari. He granted him some camels, and placed the services of a slave at his disposal. Abu Dhar settled at Rabza with his wife and daughter. He built a mosque at Rabza, and spent the remaining years of his life in prayers and religious meditation. Abu Dhar died in 652 C.E. A curious story is narrated about his death. On the day he was to die he asked his daughter to see whether any men were visible on the horizon coming that way. She saw some persons in the distance, and informed her father accordingly. Thereupon he lay on the bed with his face to the Kaaba. He told his daughter that he was now going to die, and that when the men she had seen reached there, they should be given his salutation and asked to arrange for his burial. She was further asked to prepare meals for the guests, and they should be fed after they had buried him.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Thereafter Abu Dhar Ghifari died. It was a peaceful passing on from one life to another. When the people she had seen arrived at the hut, the daughter of Abu Dhar Ghifari.

Abdullah b Masud and his men arranged for the burial of Abu Dhar Ghifari. Abdullah b Masud recalled that the Holy Prophet had said about Abu Dhar: \"He would live alone and die in solitude.\" When Uthman came to know of the death of Abu Dhar Ghifari, he shifted the wife and daughter of Abu Dhar Ghifari to Madinah, provided them with accommodation and sanctioned a special stipend for them. Later he also arranged for the marriage of the daughter of Abu Dhar Ghifari. Uthman always spoke high about Abu Dhar Ghifari He used to say: \"May God have mercy on Abu Dhar Ghifari He was a great soul, who was more a citizen of the next world than that of this world.\"\\n   </p>"

In the books which have a critical stance with reference to Uthman it is made out that Uthman was too harsh with Abu Dhar Ghaffari and that he had exiled him. In the books generally favorable to Uthman it is stated that Uthman did not exile Abu Dhar Ghifari, and that Abu Dhar Ghifari had of his own accord chosen to reside at Rabza. If all the evidence is examined dispassionately the conclusion that emerges is that there is no truth in the story about the exile of Abu Dhar Ghifari by Uthman. Rabza was only three miles from Madinah and if Uthman had exiled him he would have exiled him to some remoter place in the interior of the country. Again there is evidence to the effect that Abu Dhar Ghifari came to Madinah from Rabza on some occasions. If he had been exiled he could not have gone to Madinah. There is also evidence to the effect that Uthman had gifted some camels to Abu Dhar and also placed a slave at his disposal. He had also sanctioned a stipend in favor of Abu Dhar Ghifari. If Abu Dhar Ghifari had been the victim of the hostility of Uthman, he would not have been allowed such privileges. The truth of the matter is that Abu Dhar Ghifari being of an ascetic bent of mind preferred the solitude of the desert to the busy life of Madinah which had developed into a metropolis. Both Uthman and Abu Dhar Ghifari were great Muslims, and although they had different outlooks on life, there was no ill will between the two.\\n   </p>"

In the second year of his caliphate, Uthman appointed Sa 'ad b Abi Waqas as the Governor of Kufa. Soon a quarrel arose between Sa'ad and Abdullah. Sa'ad took some loan from the Baitul Mal and failed to return it within the stipulated period. Abdullah b Masud insisted on the repayment of the loan. The dispute grew and culminated in the deposition of Sa'ad b Abi Waqas. After Sa'ad, Walid b Uqba was appointed as the Governor of Kufa. At one time Abdullah b Masud used to shepherd the goats of Uqba b Abi Moheet the father of Walid. To start with the relationship between Walid and Abdullah b Masud was very cordial, but later differences grew between the two.\\n   </p><p>\\n    When Abdullah b Masud came to know of Uthman's reform about the recension of the Holy Quran, Abdullah b Masud was critical of the exercise. He regarded himself as an authority on the Holy Quran, and he felt aggrieved that in the standard text his viewpoint had not been accommodated. He began to criticize Uthman. According to the accounts that have come down to us Abdullah b Masud levelled the accusation that some of the verses against the Bani Umayyads had been suppressed.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Walid b Uqba also took some loan from the Baitul Mall He failed to return the loan within the stipulated period and that became the subject-matter of dispute between Walid and Abdullah. Walid complained to Uthman, and Uthman is reported to have taken objection to his conduct against the Governor. Thereupon Abdullah b Masud resigned his office, and confined himself to his house where he freely criticized Uthman and his administration. Walid reported the matter to Uthman, and Uthman directed Walid to send Abdullah b Masud to Madinah.\\n   </p>"

There can be no two opinions on the point that Uthman's exercise about the recension of the Holy Quran was in the best interests of Islam. Uthman had set up a board of eminent companions and the standard text was compiled after due deliberations and considerations of all the view points. There are reasons to hold that Abdullah b Masud submitted his view point before the board and this was duly considered. If for any reason any of the points urged by Abdullah b Masud had not been accepted, Abdullah b Masud could not be justified in making this a ground for agitation. Again Uthman took no decision in the matter at personal level. He merely accepted the recommendations of the board. As such there was no justification for making this a cause of personal grievance against Uthman. The allegation, that Uthman had some verses which were unfavorable to the Umayyads suppressed, is preposterous. A man of the caliber of Uthman could never dream of tampering with the word of God.\\n   </p><p>\\n    It appears that, in the matter of the administration of Baitul Mal, Abdullah b Masud was too fastidious. In the matter of administration a more rational view had to be taken, and if Uthman did not approve of his over\\n   </p><p>\\n    sensitiveness in some cases, Uthman as Caliph had every right to do so and no blame can rest on him.\\n   </p><p>\\n    It appears that the later writers because of partisan considerations indulged in the exercise of condemning Uthman for picking up quarrels with all eminent companions. It is inconceivable that Uthman could have expelled Abdullah b Masud from the mosque. The allegation is false firstly because such conduct could not be expected of a man like Uthman, and secondly because no Muslim could be expelled from the house of God.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The truth of the matter is that Abdullah b Masud himself resigned from the office of the treasurer of the Baitul Mall Uthman called him to Madina and looked after his needs. Soon after his arrival in Madina Abdullah b Masud fell sick and died. Uthman attended him during his sickness, and there was no ill-will between the two. Uthman led the funeral prayer of Abdullah b Masud, and the story that there was any dispute between the two on account of the recension of the Holy Quran is fictitious and false.\\n   </p>"

When Muhammad requested Uthman to be made the Governor of some province, Uthman said that if he had considered him fit to be made the Governor he would have done that, and that as he was still very young he should wait for some time till he acquired some maturity. That annoyed Muhammad, and he wanted that he should be allowed to go elsewhere. Had at Uthman permitted him to go wherever he liked. Muhammad proceeded to Egypt.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Muhammad b Abu Bakr was the son of Abu Bakr. His mother was Asma, whom Abu Bakr, married after the death of her husband Jaffar b Abu Talib. After the death of Abu Bakr, Asma married Ali. Muhammad b Abu Bakr thus grew up under the guardianship of Ali. When Uthman became the Caliph, Ali felt unhappy at being passed over. Muhammad b Abu Bakr therefore came to adopt at an early age an attitude which was critical of Uthman. Later Muhammad b Abu Bakr was a party to a case. Uthman gave his verdict against Muhammad b Abu Bakr. That annoyed Muhammad b Abu Bakr. He left Madina for Egypt.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In Egypt Muhammad b Abi Hudhaifa and Muhammad b Abu Bakr came under the influence of Ibn Saba, and came to indulge in propaganda against Abdullah b Saad the Governor of Egypt as well as Uthman. They ingratiated themselves with the army, and tried to seduce the soldiers from the cause of Uthman. When the Muslims won the naval battle known as the \"Battle of the Masts\" and felt proud of the victory, the two Muhammads tried to belittle this achievement by declaring that such victories were of no avail when the caliphate itself was indulging in anti-Islamic practices.\\n   </p><p>\\n    When Abdullah b Sa'ad came to know of this propaganda he reported the matter to Uthman and wanted his permission to take action against Muhammad b Abi Hudhaifa and Muhammad b Abu Bakr. Uthman withheld the permission saying that Muhammad b Abi Hudhaifa was his son, and that because of his regard for Abu Bakr he could not contemplate any action against his son.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In Egypt 'Amr b Al 'Aas had a party, and as 'Amr b Al 'Aas was unhappy at his deposition, his party joined those who were critical of Abdullah b Sa'ad and Uthman. Thus Egypt became a hot bed of sedition against the administration of Uthman.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The movement of Ibn Saba won allies in Madina and elsewhere, Ibn Sabaites declared that they were working for the caliphate of Ali. That won for them the sympathies of the followers of Ali. Ali himself did not espouse their cause, but the Ibn Sabaites had every reason to believe that as they were working for the cause of Ali, his sympathies could not be denied to them. Most of the companions in Madina chose to be neutral, Such companions as Abu Dhar Ghifari were critical of the luxurious style of living of those in power. The Ibn Sabaites exploited this position, and tried to give out that they were with Abu Dhar Ghifari. They gave currency to some false reports about the harassment of Abu Dhar Ghifari at the hands of Uthman and his Government.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In Kufa, the people had demanded the deposition of Saeed b 'Aas  and the appointment of Abu Musa Ash'ari. In the interests of peace Uthman yielded to the demand. In a letter addressed to the people of Kufa, Uthman hoped that as he had acceded to their demand there would be no more trouble from their side. On assuming office as Governor Abu Musa Ashari warned the people to desist from their subversive activities. He said that he would not lead them in prayer until they had assured him of their loyalty to Uthman. The people assured him of their loyalty to Uthman and gave a solemn undertaking that they would maintain peace and would not indulge in any agitation.\\n   </p>"

Uthman apprised them of his concern at the virulent propaganda that was being carried against the administration, and wanted their suggestions for overcoming the crisis. Abdullah b 'Aamir the Governor of Basra suggested that the persons responsible for making the propaganda should be sent to the borders for undertaking Jihad. Muawiyah suggested that the Governors should be authorized to suppress the sedition movements within their provinces. Abdullah b Saad proposed that the miscreants should be won over by the grant of favors. 'Amr b Al 'Aas struck a different note. He had a personal grievance against Uthman because he had been deposed from the governorship of Egypt. He observed that there could be no improvement in the situation unless Uthman changed his policies, and instead of favoring his relatives appointed the right men to the right job. Uthman directed the Governors that they should adopt all the expedients they had suggested according to local circumstances. He exhorted the Governors to be just and fair, and redress the legitimate grievances of the people. They should, however, take stern measures against the seditionist. Uthman appealed to the people in general to remain united and maintain the integrity and unity of the Ummah. He said that the enemies of Islam were out to subvert Islam by creating dissension in their ranks, and they should be beware of the enemy. Those who wanted to create differences between the people and the administration could be no friends of the Muslims. Uthman took note of the criticism of 'Amr b Al 'Aas . He said that it was for the Caliph as Head of the State to appoint such persons to State offices in whom he had confidence, and if any person was deposed in public interest, he should not make such deposition a cause of personal grievance. He pointed out that in an Islamic state, high offices were mere burdens, and one should neither covet them, nor feel aggrieved when deprived of any of such office. He added that he had never coveted the caliphate, but once he had been made the Caliph there was no option with him but to discharge the onerous duties of the office according to the best of his ability.

The Holy Prophet had an official ring which was used for the authentication of official documents. After the Holy Prophet this seal was held by Abu Bakr, and then by Umar. When Uthman became the Caliph he inherited the ring. In order to augment water supply for the citizens of Madina, Uthman had a well dug, Arees by name. One day as Uthman was supervising the digging operations the official ring fell from his finger, and was dropped in the well. Every effort was made to salvage the ring from the well, but all such efforts proved abortive. This loss of the ring was made the subject-matter of propaganda against Uthman. It was made out that the Holy Prophet had withdrawn his favor from Uthman, and a person who no longer enjoyed the favor of the Holy Prophet had no right to be the Caliph. Currency was given to many other fictitious stories of the so-called waywardness of Uthman and his government. No body could tell from where such stories emanated, but nevertheless they became the common talk of the people, and in the absence of any refutation, the people generally came to believe in the veracity of such rumors.

After praising God and the Holy Prophet, Uthman said that he had summoned that meeting at the house of God to redress the grievances of the people, to foster accord between the people and the Government; and to remove misunderstandings if any. He said that of late some false rumors had been circulating against him and his government in a surreptitious manner. He said that Islam did not favor such underhand means. Islam stood for calling a spade a spade. He said that the object of the meeting was to promote a dialogue between the people and the rulers, and to take steps to redress the grievances of the people if any. He assured the people that he would espouse their just cause, and as such they should come forward with their grievances so that these could be redressed.

Thereupon the congregation said, \"Yes O Caliph of the Holy Prophet, you are correct\".\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman continued: \"You know after the Holy Prophet Abu Bakr became the Caliph and after him Umar became the Caliph. During this period the Muslim dominions expanded, and the Muslim State was burdened with onerous responsibilities. Abu Bakr and Umar administered the affairs of the State with admirable skill. Thereafter the burden fell on me. I swear by God that I did not covet the office, but once I had been made the caliph, I had to discharge my functions. You know Umar was a hard task master. After him you wanted some relaxation. In contrast I followed mild policies. At the outset of my rule I increased the stipends of the people. I treated the people as my children, and my treatment was liberal and generous\". Then Uthman paused and inquired of the people whether what he had said was correct. They answered, \"Yes, we testify to your kindness.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman added, \"You know after the demise of Umar there were revolts in Persia, and the Persians made a bid to overthrow the Muslim yoke. At one time we practically lost the whole of Persia. In this crisis your Government was not found wanting. We directed campaigns in Persia. The whole of Persia was reconquerd. Not only that but we extended the Muslim conquests. In the east we reached the borders of India. In the north we penetrated into Transoxiana and reached the borders of China. You know the Byzantines tried to reconquer Egypt and captured Alexandria. We drove them from the soil of Egypt. Thereafter we undertook campaigns in North Africa, and captured the whole of North Africa. Thereafter we crossed over Spain and established a foothold there. You know the Muslims had heretofore avoided wars on the sea. During my time the Muslims became a naval power for the first time. We conquered the island of Cypress. We defeated the Byzantines at the battle of the Masts. We conducted campaigns in Asia Minor and captured many Byzantine forts.\" Uthman paused and addressing the people said, \" O ye people, swear by God whether what I have said is correct or not?\" The people cried with one voice, \"We testify that what you have said is correct\".\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman further said, \"Now O people look around you and say honestly whether you are not more prosperous than what were you yesterday. Look to Madina itself. Has it not expanded and is such expansion not an indication of the prosperity of the people. Are the people of Makkah not more prosperous than what they were in the past. Is there any man in the State who is starved. Previously the companions were not allowed to leave Madina. Have I not removed this restriction. Have I not allowed free purchase and sale of land. Have I not promoted your freedom of speech and movement? Look to your Baitul Mall Does it not have more reserve than what it had previously? Look to the Prophet's mosque at Madina. Have I not extended it. Again look to the Ka'aba. Have I not extended or embellished it? Please let me know whether this is correct or not\". And the people said that verily this was correct.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman continued: \"If all that I have said is correct is it not uncharitable on the part of some of the people to indulge in unfounded propaganda. If you make the head of your State the victim of false propaganda you weaken the solidarity of the Ummah. Our strength lies in our unity, and if any attempt is made to sow dissension among the Muslims we will be playing in the hands of the enemy. I therefore appeal to you to be just and fair. If you seek justice you must be just yourself. I assure you that if you have any legitimate grievance it will be redressed. On the other hand if you have no real grievance, but merely resort to frivolous allegations that will be neither in your interest nor in the interests of the State.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman said, \"Now I will dwell on the various allegations that are afloat against me or my Government. I am criticized that on the occasion of the Hajj I offered four rakaats of prayers instead of availing of the concession of two rakaats in accordance with the precedent set by the Holy Prophet and my two predecessors. In this connection it may be borne in mind that the stipulated number of rakaats in such prayers is four, but in the case of exceptional circumstances the prayer can be shortened to two rakaats. Now such exceptional circumstances cannot last for all times. I have married in Makkah and I reside here for some time in a year. I therefore felt that I was no longer entitled to the concession of shortening the prayer. If four rakaats were enjoined and I had shortened them I could have been held guilty, but when I offer the full prayers, and do not avail of a concession meant for exceptional circumstances, what is the wrong that I have done. Again it is said that I have been guilty of sacrilege in burning some copies of the Holy Quran. Do you know what happened to the Holy Books revealed to other prophets. Their followers produced variety of versions, and in such diversity the original text was lost. I was anxious that the Holy Quran should not become a victim of such diversity. I therefore in consultation with the eminent companions had a standard text compiled, and destroyed all other texts, so that the integrity of the text should be maintained for all times. O Muslims I ask you in the name of God whether this was a service or a disservice to the cause of Islam?\" Uthman paused for a reply from the people and they said, \"Yes, O Caliph you have done a great service to the cause of Islam\".\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman continued: It is objected that 1 have appointed young persons to high offices, and that most of the Governors are my relatives. In appointing young persons I followed the precedent set by the Holy Prophet. He appointed Usama a young man of seventeen to lead the expedition against the Byzantines. It is true that some of the Governors are related to me. As Caliph I am responsible for the administration of the entire country. I have therefore to appoint persons in whom I have full confidence. Whether a person is related to me or not is not the material thing. The material thing is: how far have such persons discharged their functions. Is it not a fact that as Governor Muawiyah is most popular in Syria? Is it not a fact that Abdullah b Sa'ad conquered the whole of North Africa? Is it not a fact that he was the victor of the battle of the Masts? Is it not a fact that Uqba's son Walid was most popular in Kufa during the first five years of his rule and I removed him when voices were raised against his rule? Is it not a fact as the Governor of Basra Abdullah b 'Aamir reconquerd the whole of Persia, and even carried the Muslim arms to Transoxiana? O Muslims be just and fair. How can you deny the achievements of these Governors in the cause of Islam, and merely condemn them because they are related to me? I assure you that I appointed them because I thought them to be the fittest persons. All of them came to my expectations and I maintain that I did not commit any wrong in appointing them as Governors. On the other hand Muhammad b Hudhaifa who was like a son to me wanted to be appointed to a post but 1 refused to do so, because I did not consider him fit to bear such responsibilities.\" Then Uthman paused and said, \"Have I not narrated the true facts\", and the people said, ~ Yes, you have stated the facts as they are..\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman continued, \"It is said that I have reserved the pastures for my camels. This is incorrect. I have reserved the State pastures for State camels and that was necessary. It is objected that I recalled my uncle Hakam from exile. The fact is that the Holy Prophet exiled him, and then permitted his recall. It is objected that on the eve of the conquest of Makkah, Abdullah b Sa'ad was on the murder list, but I intervened on his behalf. It is true that Abdullah b Sa'ad was guilty, but he repented. Forgiveness is an attribute of God. On the occasion of the conquest of Makkah the Holy Prophet granted the Quraish general amnesty and in this context he forgave Abdullah b Sa'ad. Thereafter Abdullah b Sa'ad proved to be a staunch Muslim and he performed valuable services in the cause of Islam. Uqba's son Walid was certainly guilty of a lapse but the Holy Prophet forgave him. It is a tradition of the Holy Prophet that once a man is forgiven we have to judge him solely on the basis of his conclusion after such forgiveness. These persons have nothing to their discredit after they had been forgiven. It is uncharitable on the part of Muslims to condemn these persons for their conduct for which they have been forgiven. If previous misconduct is to remain alive what is the purpose of forgiveness?\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman said, \"I have had may say. Now I am prepared to listen to you. If any one of you has any legitimate grievance against me or my Government you are free to give expression to such grievance, and I assure you that, I will do my best to redress such grievance.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    The seditionist had come fully prepared to give vent to their imaginary grievances, but they realized that the people in view of the defense offered by Uthman were not in the mood to listen to any imaginary grievances. All the seditionist remained quiet, and they did not have the courage to declare any grievance.\\n   </p><p>\\n    That was a great psychological victory for Uthman.\\n   </p>"

It was given out that the administration of Egypt was guilty of tyranny and oppression. 'Amr b A1 'Aas  took pains to project the view that under Abdullah b Sa'ad, the Governor of Egypt, the taxes were most oppressive, and while the she camel had been forced to give more milk its young ones had been starved. Muhammad b Abu Bakr had personal grievances against Uthman, and he condemned Uthman's Government for its inefficiency. 'Ammar b Yasir had at the outset supported the candidature of Ali for the caliphate, and he was a bitter critic of the administration of Uthman. It cannot be said why Uthman chose to send him to Egypt to inquire into the affairs of the province when it was known that he was prejudiced against the caliphate of Uthman. Perhaps Uthman considered that a report by a person who did not belong to his camp was likely to be more assuring 'Ammar b Yasir, however, did not submit any report. Instead in Egypt he joined with the malcontents, and carried on propaganda against Uthman. When 'Ammar returned to Madina he did not see Uthman. Instead he became active in creating unrest in Madina.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Marwan a cousin of Uthman acted as his Secretary. Another cousin of Uthman acted as the Superintendent of the markets in Madina. Uthman paid them for their services from the Baitul Mall This was made the subject of criticism. Uthman gave some gifts from the Baitul Mal to Zubair b Awwam and Talha b 'Ubaidah. It is not known what exactly was the occasion for the grant of such gifts but presumably such gifts were made because of their services. Criticism against Uthman took over a virulent form. People began to talk freely as to who would be the next Caliph. Many doggerals were composed supporting the candidature of Ali, Zubair and Talha as the next Caliph.\\n   </p>"

Many things are being said against you, but I do not know how I should tell you what they say. I cannot think of any matter about which I can advise you, nor do I know of anything more than what you know. You are aware of all this. How should I give you any information, for I am not better informed than you, nor anything has been said in secret, about which I know but you do not. We are all nothing in front of you. You have seen the Holy Prophet; heard him; and lived in close companionship with him. Neither Abu Bakr, nor Umar were superior to you in any way. In relationship to the Holy Prophet you were closer to him than all of us. The position attained by you was gained by none else. Under your caliphate the community has come to be faced with some problems. O Caliph, invoke God's help in solving these problems. I need offer you no' advice. Take heed and remember that the nearest to God is a Caliph who is just and upholds the covenant of Allah as revealed to the Holy Prophet and discards all that was discarded by him. The worst man on earth is the Imam who is cruel and one who has gone astray himself, and makes others go astray, who revives the discarded vices and discards virtues. All these things are clear to you. Right and wrong are far apart. I have myself heard the Holy Prophet say that on the Day of Judgment, a tyrant Imam will be friendless and sent down to hell. He would revolve around it like a grinder and then be plunged into the bottomless pit. I want to remind you of God's powers, and His revenge. His punishment is severe and powerful. Be careful that you do not become the murdered Imam for the flock for it is said that one of the Imams would be killed who would open door to dissension within the community. Things would come to such a pass that the Muslims would be divided into various sections. Falsehood would gain such ascendancy that people would forget what is right.\"\\n   </p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n    On the following Friday, Uthman addressed the congregation in the Prophet's mosque. After praising God and the Holy Prophet, Uthman said:\\n   </p><p>\\n    \"It has come to my notice that many false things are being said against me and my administration. You know after the Holy Prophet, Abu Bakr became the Caliph and after him Umar became the Caliph. I served both of them, and they were happy with me. After Umar I was chosen as the Caliph. I swear\\n   </p><p>\\n    by Allah that I did not covet the office. You know I was already very rich and the office of the Caliph could not be a matter of any material advantage for me. You know Umar was harsh and stern. He was not hard with the people alone; he was hard with his own person. May God bless him. His services to the cause of Islam cannot be forgotten. When I became the Caliph, I felt that the people wanted some change in policies. I consequently followed liberal policies and relaxed some of the harsh measures that had been in force in the time of Umar. I increased the stipends of the people. I withdrew the restraints that had been imposed in the time of Umar. The rule of any Imam is to be judged on the basis of the prosperity of the people. Look around you and say honestly whether you are not more prosperous today than what you were at the time of my succession. The Muslim dominions today are much more extensive than what they were twelve years ago. The people now are wealthier and richer than what they were before. As a result of military operations there has been much of booty. All such booty has been distributed among the people according to the formula laid down by the Holy Prophet. After such distributions there are ample funds in the Baitul Mal to meet our future needs. I have served the people to the best of my ability. It is however a matter of regret to note that instead of appreciating the good that I have done, a malicious propaganda is being carried out in some quarters to malign me. I chose to be kind and liberal. I tried to be a benevolent ruler. It is very unfortunate that undue advantage has been taken of my liberality and my kindness has been mistaken for my weakness. It is given out that I am weak and fickle, that I am led by others around me. It is true that I have some persons around me who help me in State affairs, but it is not correct that I play into their hands. I take all decisions myself. It is said that such and such persons are my evil genius who are leading me on the wrong path. Every person has the right to choose his own advisers, and if I have to my own satisfaction chosen certain persons as my advisers, it is not for any one to say that I should not have appointed such and such a person as my adviser. You merely cavil at persons; you do not bring out in specific terms what wrong has been done. You take pleasure in distorting facts. You give currency to rumors and do not care to verify facts. You say that I gave one lakh dirhams to Harith b Hakam out of the Baitul Mall I have married my son to his daughter and I gave him this money out of my pocket for financing the marriage. The money was not paid out of the Baitul Mall You say that I gave one lakh dirhams to Marwan b Hakam out of the Baitul Mall This is sheer falsehood. I have married my daughter to a son of Marwan and I gave one lakh dirhams in dowry. This money was paid out of my pocket and not from the Baitul Mall It is said that I paid Abdullah b Khalid 3 lakh dirhams from the Baitul Mall He has taken this money as a loan from the Baitul Mal and he will repay it according to the terms of the loan. It is said that I deposed Abdullah b Arqam from his office of the custodianship of the Baitul Mal because he had protested against my grants from the Baitul Mall There is no truth in this allegation. Abdullah b Arqam had held this office for the last twenty-five years, and being old he has retired of his own freewill. Again it is said that I have diverted funds from the Baitul Mal for the construction of private property. This is a tissue of falsehood. I have constructed my private property with my own money, and all know that I have ample resources of my own. It is alleged that I have gifted the entire surplus money in the Baitul Mal to Zaid b Thabit the new Treasurer. This is again a sheer lie. After distributing the money in the Baitul Mal, there was a surplus amount of 1,000 dirhams in the Baitul Mall I asked Zaid b Thabit to utilize this amount for some public purpose, and he utilized this amount for the repair of the \\n   </p><p>\\n    Prophet's mosque.\\n   </p><p>\\n    O people I exhort you to fear God, and not to indulge in false propaganda. All the Muslims are one community. Do not create dissension among the Muslims. If you are tired of me, you may rest assured that being an old man, I do not have long to live. If you want me to abdicate, let you know that this is duly assigned to me by God, and I would never run away from duty whatever the pressure used against me. If you think of employing any force against me, you should be beware that I have my supporters who will support me through thick and thin. I appeal to you not to be misled by false rumors. I assure you of full justice. I expect justice from you. Do not be unnecessarily critical. If you have any legitimate grievance I will certainly redress it; if you are swayed by imaginary grievances, that would lead to mere confusion \"\\n   </p>"

As the conspiracy against him was deep rooted there was no diminution in the virulence of the campaign against him. That was because the agitation against Uthman was not being led on the basis of any principles; it was prompted by ulterior motives to overthrow his Government. In Madina, Muhammad b Abu Bakr, 'Aamir b Yasir, and 'Amr b Al 'Ass whipped up the vilification campaign against Uthman, and fed the people on false tales about the atrocities committed on the people of Egypt.

On hearing of the revolt in Egypt, Abdullah hastened back to Egypt. Uthman was not in the position to give him any military assistance. Abdullah b Sa'ad accordingly failed to recapture power in Egypt. He was warned by Muhammad b Abu Hudhaifa not to enter Fustat. Failing to muster sufficient support, Abdullah b Sa'ad retired to Ramlah where he died two years later.\\n   </p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n    With the capture of power by Muhammad b Abu Hudhaifa in Egypt the stage was set for an open revolt against the caliphate of Uthman. In Kufa though Abu Musa Ashtari, as Governor, paid nominal allegiance to Uthman, he was really a nominee of the rebels, and could not go against their wishes. In Basra the Governor Abdullah b 'Aamir left for Hajj, and in his absence the affairs of the province fell into a state of confusion. Thus the three main provinces of Egypt, Kufa, and Basra came to be cut off from the caliphate of Uthman, and became the center of revolt.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In the month of Shawwal, a contingent of about 1,000 persons was sent from Egypt to Madina. These persons traveled in four separate groups, and gave out that they were going to perform the Hajj. They were fully armed, and their instructions were to overthrow the government of Uthman, and to murder him. The contingent was led by Amir Ghafqi b Harb. Ibn Saba accompanied the contingent as their general adviser.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Similar contingents marched from Kufa and Basra to Madina. The Kufa contingent was led by Ashtar Nakh'i while the contingent from Basra was led by Hakim b Jabala.\\n   </p><p>\\n    All these contingents converged on Madina according to a pre-arranged plan. Reaching the neighborhood of Madina the contingent from Egypt encamped at Dhil Marwah. The contingent from Basra encamped at Dukhshab, while the contingent from Kufa encamped at Ahwas. From these camps the contingents sent their representatives to one another for mutual consultation. They also sent their representatives to Madina to contact the leaders of public opinion The representatives of the contingent from Egypt waited on Ali, and offered him the caliphate in succession to Uthman. Ali turned down their offer. The representatives of the contingent from Kufa waited on Zubair, while the representatives of the contingent from Basra waited on Talha, and offered them their allegiance as the next Caliph. These offers were turned down. This move on the part of the rebels neutralized the bulk of public opinion in Madina. Madina could no longer offer a united front; it became a divided house. Uthman could enjoy the active support of the Umayyads, and a few other persons in Madina. The rest of the people of Madina chose to be neutral and help neither side. That was a big gain for the rebels. After surveying the situation in Madina, the rebels felt satisfied that the circumstances were favorable to the launching of their campaign for overthrowing the government of Uthman.\\n   </p>"

The usual version is that Uthman appealed to Ali to intervene and use his influence with the rebels to prevail upon them to withdraw from Madina. It is related that Ali was critical of the conduct of Uthman, and Uthman gave a solemn undertaking that in future he would be guided by the counsels of Ali. It is said that Ali met the rebels, and prevailed upon them to retire from Madina. They agreed to do so, in case formal orders were passed by the Caliph for the deposition of Abdullah b Sa 'ad from the governorship of Egypt. Had rat Uthman passed the orders for the deposition of Abdullah b Sa'ad, and the appointment of Muhammad b Abu Bakr as the Governor of Egypt.\\n   </p><p>\\n    It is stated that on the demand of Ali, Uthman addressed the people in the Prophet's mosque; admitted his mistakes; prayed for the forgiveness of Allah and the people; and undertook to make amends within three days. It is said that on this occasion Uthman wept and the audience wept with him. The accounts continue that under the influence of Marwan b Hakam Uthman retracted from his repentance, and did not make any amends. Uthman and Ali had another meeting at which Ali accused Uthman of breach of faith. Ali felt deeply annoyed, and said that that was the parting of ways between them.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The accounts that have come down to us continue that when the rebels from Egypt proceeded a few stages from Madina they came across a slave of Uthman who was carrying a letter of Uthman to the Governor of Egypt commanding him not to give effect to the orders regarding his deposition, arrest the rebels and execute them. That made the rebels return to Madina. The rebels from Kufa and Basra returned likewise. It is stated that the rebels brought this breach of faith on the part of Uthman to the notice of the leaders of public opinion in Madina and invoked their assistance. Uthman admitted that the letter bore his official seal, but he denied all knowledge about the contents of the letter. It was contended that the letter was in the handwriting of Marwan. Marwan was however never confronted with the letter, and the accounts recorded in histories leave the matter about the contents of the letter unresolved.\\n   </p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n    If the accounts contained in the histories are analyzed we arrive at the conclusion that such accounts do not bear the test of subjective scrutiny. These accounts Paint Uthman as a fickle old man with no will of his own, who is apt to be led by other persons. This does not appear to be a true picture of the character and personality of Uthman, and the accounts are obviously biased and prejudiced. Uthman was a man of great intelligence. He was one of the richest persons in Arabia and he could not have amassed such riches if he were not a good judge of men and matters around him.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The accounts that Uthman asked Ali to intervene and he did so on Uthman giving the assurance that he would make amends, and would in future be guided by the advice of Ali do not appear to be correct. We have an alternative version in Tabari that the rebels met Uthman himself in a village outside Madina, and after hearing him they felt satisfied and returned to Egypt.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The story that Uthman offered repentance, admitted his faults, and promised to make amends does not make sense. In his speech at Makkah on the occasion of the pilgrimage, and thereafter in his speech at Madina, Uthman had offered full defense and had justified his conduct. It is plain common sense that in the face of such defense wherein he had categorically refuted all charges against him he could not turn a somersault, and admit his faults. It has also to be borne in mind that in case Uthman admitted that he had made mistakes he forfeited the right to the caliphate. It is plain common sense that if a person in high office admits his mistake the only honorable course for him is to resign, for a man who has made mistakes cannot be allowed another lease of life in office to make more mistakes. The irresistible conclusion to which we are forced is that the story that Uthman admitted his mistakes is an invention of partisan writers whose aim was to present Uthman in false colors.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The story that Uthman had repented, and that he fumed a somersault at the instance of Marwan is too crude to be correct. The sorry was given currency by the enemies of Uthman whose aim was to present Uthman as a man unfit to hold the high office of the caliphate for he had no will of his own, and was apt to play in the hands of others. Nothing could be farther from the truth. History has done great injustice to Uthman by suppressing the true facts, and narrating only such distorted facts that suited the enemies of Uthman.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Again the story of the forged letter that the Egyptians are said to have intercepted has no legs to stand upon. It may be recalled that at that time Muhammad b Abi Hudhaifa was in control of Egypt and Uthman could not write to him who was hostile to him to arrest the persons who were his own men.\\n   </p><p>\\n    It has also to be borne in mind that the rebels had been commissioned to prevail on Uthman to abdicate or to murder him in the event of refusal. These rebels could, therefore, not return to Egypt merely by securing an order for the deposition of Abdullah b Sa'ad, particularly when he was no longer in office, and had retired to Ramlah.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The truth of the matter appears to be that there was no intenention on the part of Ali; there was no repentance on the part of Uthman; the Egyptians did not return to Egypt; and there was no interception of any letter, forged or otherwise. What happened actually was merely this that the rebels studied the position in Madina, and when they felt satisfied that the people of Madina would not offer them any resistance, they entered the city of Madina and laid siege to the house of Uthman. The rebels declared that no harm from them would come to any person who did not choose to resist them. The advised the people of Madina to remain in their homes. Most of the people of Madina left for their gardens in the suburbs. Those who did not leave Madina remained confined to their houses. Only some persons, mostly the Umayyads gathered in the house of Uthman, but they were instructed by Uthman to refrain from violence.\\n   </p>"

Those who rebel against authority incur the wrath of God.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Allah said, \"They who pledge allegiance to you pledge allegiance to Me. On them is My Hand.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    In the light of these verses from the Holy Quran bear in mind that Allah is pleased with those who obey authority and who stand for unity and solidarity. Allah has condemned dissension and discord. He has brought home this point to us by narrating the stories of previous communities. Therefore act according to the injunctions of God, and be afraid of His punishment. If you ponder over history, it will be revealed to you that the previous communities were destroyed because they became victims of dissension. For the good of a people, there is no way other than this that they should have a head, in whose obedience they should be united. If you follow the way of discord and dissension, your community would disintegrate, and the enemy would come to dominate over you.\\n   </p><p>\\n    If all this comes to pass, then the religion of God would receive a set back, and the community would disintegrate into a number of sects. Allah told the Holy Prophet, \"Have no concern with the people who have broken their unity and disintegrated into sects. Leave them to God. God will take them to task for their misdeeds \"\\n   </p><p>\\n    I offer you the same advice as God has offered. I ask you to fear his punishment. Shuaib had told his people, \"O people beware lest my opposition leads you to the same end as befell the communities of Noah, Hud, or Salih.\" Since some time past, some people from amongst us have tried to present themselves as the apostles of truth, who are not interested in the affairs of the world, and who have no axe to grind. But when they were presented with reality, some of them accepted the truth, but some o them disputed the truth. Some of them stood for falsehood, but they posed as if the truth lay with them. Such persons feel upset at my longevity. They covet power. They long for an immediate revolution. Such persons have written to you that they are waging the struggle against me to get their rights. I do not know of which rights I have divested them, which they now demand from me. They demanded that no one should be above the law. I told them that I fully agreed with them. I asked them to bring all cases to my notice and I assured them that the law would be enforced against all, high or low without any distinction. But they could bring no case to my notice where any person had defied the law and proper action had not been taken against him. They said that the injunctions of the Quran should be followed. I said that I wholeheartedly agreed with the demand but would not permit any innovation or deviation. The people demanded that the poor should get bread, the laborer should get his wages. I said that I was at one with them, and it is open to them to make their suggestions in the matter. They demanded that, in the matter of Sadaqa and Khums the right of early one should be protected. I said that I agreed with the demand and they were welcome to make their suggestions in that behalf. I saw the wives of the Holy Prophet, and agreed to act according to their advice. I have accepted all legitimate demands, but in spite of that I am being oppressed and harassed. I have been prevented from leading the prayers in the Prophet's mosque. The rioters have established their full control over Madina.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The rioters have put three alternatives before me. They demand Qasaas from me for all grievances that any person may have suffered because of any verdict passed by me as Caliph. Their other alternative is that I should abdicate so that they might choose another Caliph. The third alternative is that they should assemble the people who support them, and then repudiate the allegiance to my caliphate.\\n   </p><p>\\n    All these demands are preposterous. There have been rulers and Caliphs in history who had been vested with the authority to pass judgments. The judgments might be right or worn\", but no body has the right to sit over such judgment and demand compensation. Such a demand is against all principles of jurisprudence. As regards the demand for abdication I hold myself responsible to God, and I cannot abandon my post at the behest of any one. The third alternative is ridiculous. No ruler in his senses would provide facilities to the rioters to rebel against him.\\n   </p><p>\\n    These people are apparently after my life, and their sole object appears to be to murder me. I have advised my supporters not to use any force. I do not want that the Muslim community should fall a victim to civil war. I will watch developments with due patience, and would await the decision of God. If I have to give my life in the way of Allah I would have no hesitation in making the sacrifice. I know that as Caliph I have done nothing wrong. Nevertheless I seek the forgiveness of Allah. May Allah forgive us all. May Allah have mercy on the Muslims.\\n   </p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n    If this somewhat lengthy letter is studied analytically it will be seen that Uthman did not appeal to the Muslims to come to his aid. There is nothing in the letter to incite the Muslims to violence against the rioter. Uthman merely apprised the people of the situation. He was averse to civil war, and did not want any blood to be shed. He resigned himself to the will of God, and prepared himself to meet eventualities with a smiling face. It appears that the object of the letter was merely to exhort the Muslims to do their duty to Islam. The Muslims were required to fear God, to hold fast to the cord of Allah, to maintain unity in their ranks, to take lesson from history, to obey Allah, His Messenger and those in authority, and to suppress evils, discord and dissension. It appears that Uthman was concerned more with the welfare of the Islamic community than with his personal safety. The letter was read by Abdullah b Abbas at the time of the pilgrimage. It is not known what was the reaction of the people to the letter. It seems that as no attempt was made to rally any support for Uthman, the people dispersed after hearing the letter. By the time Abbas returned from the pilgrimage to Madina, all was over, and Uthman was dead.\\n   </p>"

We were fortunate to be favored with Islam. Islam welded us into a single community. Islam gave us the message of unity. The Holy Prophet passed away after fulfilling his mission. After him his mission was carried by Abu Bakr and then by Umar. After Umar I was chosen as the Caliph. I never coveted the office, but when the people took the oath of allegiance to me, I felt myself under an obligation to administer the affairs of the State to the best of my ability. I performed the duties of my office conscientiously and during the earlier part of my rule, the people were satisfied. I allowed the people greater freedom, and more privileges. That was done in the best interests of the people. During my caliphate the people have become more prosperous. Instead of being grateful to me for my services to the cause of Islam, some people for some unknown reason have resorted to false propaganda and poisoned the atmosphere. I have made every possible effort to redress the legitimate grievances of the people. It is unfortunate that the malcontents do not come forward with any specific grievance. They make one demand today and make a contrary demand the following day without advancing any reason or argument. I have dealt with these people with due patience and forbearance, but their aim appears to be to subvert Islam by promoting disunity. I warn the Muslims in general against the activities of these persons who wish to weaken Islam as a social and political force. In this crisis in the affairs of the Muslims I seek the cooperation of all who are devoted to Islam. He who can side with us may do so.\"\\n   </p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n    If this letter is studied analytically, it will be seen that the letter is coached in general terms. There is nothing therein calling upon the supporters of Government to muster in strength and come to Madina for relief. In the accounts that have come down to us it appears that the Governors of Syria and Basra sent some relief forces, but that when they were a few stages from Madina they came to know that Uthman had been assassinated, and on coming to know of this tragedy they returned to their provinces. If these forces had come to fight for Uthman, there is no reason why they should have returned on coming to know of the tragedy. On the other hand such tragedy should have spurred them to violent action against the rioters. Apparently they had come in aid of maintaining law and order. When the Caliph had been killed it implied that thc law and order situation had become grave. In such context the responsibility of these forces was to rush to Madina to preserve law and order, and take the law breakers to task. The ttruth of the matter is that no force came from any of the provinces because Uthman wanted to avoid a civil war. It may be recalled that when Muawiyah had offered to send a contingent from Syria to act as a guard, Uthman had not accepted the offer, because he did not want any blood to be shed in the city of the Holy Prophet. It may also be recalled that when the slaves of Uthman volunteered to take up arms he restrained them from such action, and said, \"He who does not take up arms is free\". When Imam Hasan and some other persons sought the permission of Uthman to fight against the rebels, Uthman did not permit them to do so and asked them to retire to their houses. In this crisis, Uthman set the noble example of resignation to the will of God. He preferred to sacrifice his own life, rather than lead the people to civil war. The story that the provincial forces came late and returned when they came to know of the assassination of Uthman appears to have been invented by the party opposed to Uthman to create the impression that Uthman had become unpopular even in provinces where his relatives were the Governors. The memory of Uthman deserves to be cherished as a great soul who sacrificed his life in vindication of the principles for which he stood. May God have mercy on the soul of Uthman.\\n   </p>"

He was not a father to me alone, he was a father to the entire Muslim community. Alas, those whom he regarded as his sons have murdered him.\\n   </p><p>\\n    O ye murderers of Uthman bear in mind that we all are the creatures of God, and all of us have to return to Him. How deplorable that in the sacred city of the Holy Prophet, a person so close and dear to the Holy Prophet was murdered in cold blood. Even after his assassination, the murderers created difficulties in the burial of his dead body.\\n   </p><p>\\n    O God, if the murdered Caliph had chosen to exercise his authority many persons would have arisen to defend him. Truth and justice were on his side, and God fearing people would have certainly taken up cudgels on his behalf. In that case the rioters would have been shot at, their heads would have been cut off, and there would have been lot of bloodshed. But that was not the way of Uthman. What you considered right he held it to be wrong. He was against any bloodshed. He preferred to give up his own life rather than resort to measures which were likely to promote civil war.\\n   </p><p>\\n    O ye murderers, as Muslims you had to be loyal and faithful to your Caliph at whose hands you had taken the oath of allegiance. By murdering your Caliph you have betrayed Islam; you have proved false even to yourself. You let loose a flood of false propaganda against him, and made allegations against him which were groundless. He refuted all such allegations in categorical terms, but you persisted in your evil design. You have murdered an innocent man, and his blood cries for vengeance.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Father, may Allah have mercy on you. You resigned yourself to the will of God as a true Muslim. In the midst of trials and tribulations you exhibited patience, and bore all hardships without complaint. You met your death with a smiling face. You are martyr in the cause of Allah. In the heavens your place is now in the company of the Holy Prophet.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Now dissension have broken up among your enemies, and they are quarrelling among themselves. Mischief is abroad, and tyrannies of your enemies are now becoming manifest. Now the veil of their hypocrisy is being turn, and they have begun to indulge in conspiracies against one another.\\n   </p><p>\\n    O the murderers of Uthman, how cruel and unjust you have been. You were actuated by extraneous considerations, and you raised preposterous demands. Uthman merely followed in the footsteps of his predecessor. Why did you not raise any demand in the time of Umar. He was harsh, and you did not raise a voice against him as you were afraid of him. On the contrary Uthman treated you kindly. You took undue advantage of his kindness, and instead of appreciating his kindness and mildness you indulged in a vilification campaign against him. That was ingratitude of the worst type. Ingratitude is a great crime before man and God. Ungrateful persons have never prospered. Know that history would never forgive you for your betrayal and ingratitude. Also know that in the world to come severe punishment awaits those who are unjust. Hell will be their abode.\\n   </p><p>\\n    You may recall that the caliphate of Umar was a period of great trial for you. You lived in an atmosphere of awe and fear. He imposed restrictions on your movements. He curtailed your liberties. You submitted to him without raising any protest. You could not dare speak before him, you could not criticize him. He was the Caliph who always carried a whip in his hand. He treated you as dumb cattle and you submitted to this fate. Uthman treated you as men. He allowed you full liberties. He removed all the restrictions on your movements. He increased your stipends, and looked after your welfare in every way. You have recompensed him by murdering him. That is very strange. You have falsified all Islamic values. You have repaid good with evil. Today the Grace of God has been estranged from you. You have been guilty of a great crime. Know that evil cannot hold for long. Ultimately truth will triumph, you will be called to account for your misdeeds. I have perfect faith in God, and I am sure God will duly avenge the murder of Uthman. May the soul of Uthman rest in eternal peace in the heaven! He has been the victim of grave injustice in this world, I am sure Allah will duly compensate him in the next world.\"\\n   </p>"

He enlarged and embellished the Prophet's mosque. He constructed numerous wells to provide adequate supply of water to you. In the time of famines he distributed large stocks of grain purchased by him out of his own money, in the way of Allah.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman was the first citizen of your city. He did much for you, but, you did little for him. He was assassinated by rioters in front of you, but you remained confined to your houses. Every murder is heinous, but the murder of Uthman is the most heinous and most grievous of ail murders in history. The murder of their Caliph by the people is a betrayal of Islam. He was assassinated in the sacred city of Madina and that was a great sacrilege. He was murdered during the sacred month of the Hajj, and thereby the sanctity of the sacred month was violated.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Islam came as a great blessing to mankind. Islam stood for a complete break with the age of ignorance. The brutal murder of Uthman amounts to the revival of the age of ignorance. His murder has opened the door of dissension among the Muslims. With his death the process of our conquests will come to standstill. Henceforward the Muslims instead of fighting against the non-Muslims will fight among themselves. I see dark days ahead for the Muslims. May God have mercy on us! May He have mercy on Uthman and assign him a fitting abode in the paradise!\"\\n   </p>"

By way of your relationship with him, the responsibility to avenge his blood devolves on you. It is the command of Allah that if there is bloodshed between two groups of Muslims you should strive for peace among them, but, if any group transgresses, take action against the rebels and kill them.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Some people rebelled against Uthman without just cause. You know what high position Uthman commanded in Islam. He was very close and dear to the Holy Prophet. He never coveted the caliphate. He was chosen as the Caliph by the people. During the twelve years of his office he worked day and night for the welfare of the people. During his caliphate extensive conquests were made. Immense wealth flowed into the public treasury. The stipends of the people were increased. The people became more prosperous. Instead of appreciating the benefits of his rule some miscreants because of ulterior considerations conspired against him. Uthman could have suppressed such agitation with force, but he refrained from using force against his people. As a true Muslim he resigned himself to the decree of God.\\n   </p><p>\\n    He satisfactorily explained all the allegations that were levelled against him. During the twelve years of his caliphate he did' not charge any thing for his emoluments from the public treasury. He spent large amounts from his own resources for public benefit. He was the richest man in Arabia at the time of becoming the caliph; after becoming the caliph his assets steadily diminished. False and frivolous charges of nepotism were levelled against him, he was a good judge of men and matters, and he appointed only such persons who enjoyed his confidence, and who could be expected to carry forward his policies.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The revolt against Uthman was the result of some antinational conspiracy. Some extraneous forces pulled the wires. Jealous of the triumphs of Islam they conspired to subvert Islam from within. What is regrettable is that even some eminent Companions played into the hands of these conspirators, and lent them their indirect support.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The rioters besieged the house of Uthman. They stood at the door fully armed. They did not allow any food or water to enter the house. We were denied the use of water from the well which Uthman had purchased with his own money. The rebels accepted the lead of Ali, Muhammad b Abu Bakr, Talha and Zubair in all matters. Among the rioters were the tribes of Khuza'ah, Sa'ad b Bakr, Hudhail, Jahina, and the Muzina They also included contingents from\\n   </p><p>\\n    Basra and Kufa In the siege the rioters wounded Uthman with arrows. These persons killed some persons who wanted to fight against them in defense of the Caliph. The Caliph looked around him, but he could see no person in Madina from whom he could expect justice.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The rioters penetrated into the house. They burnt the gate, broke 'tine windows and looted property. Muhammad b Abu Bakr pulled the beard of the Caliph. Then one of the rioters struck Uthman on the head and he fell down unconscious. The rioters wanted to cut off his head. I and Bint Shiba threw ourselves on the body of Uthman. They pulled us away and robbed us of our ornaments.\\n   </p><p>\\n    I am sending you along with this letter the blood stained clothes of the Caliph. Please see that his blood does not go unavenged. May Allah have mercy on the soul of Uthman! May the curse of God be on his murderers!\"\\n   </p>"

The Umayyads established the monarchical order in order to avoid the conflict and bloodshed which were likely to engulf the Muslim community on the occasion of every new succession.

The revolts in both the cases were anti-Umayyad in character. In the revolt against Uthman, the main point of the agitation against him was that he had appointed the Umayyads to high offices. In the case of the Karbala tragedy the stand of Imam Hussain was that the Umayyads had converted the caliphate into hereditary monarchy, and that Yazid in view of his notorious character was not fit to be the Caliph.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In the case of Uthman the authority vested in him, and the rioters demanded his deposition. Had-at Uthman refused to abdicate because he held that he could not resign from an office which he held on behalf of God on account of any pressure from the public. He gave his life but did not agree to abdicate. According to his way of thinking that was the only way to resolve the deadlock. Thus he preferred the cause of Islam to his life, and he died as a martyr. In this case the truth and justice were on the side of Uthman, while the rioters had no just cause to agitate.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Hussain stood for the integrity of the caliphate. His objection was against the transformation of the caliphate into royalty. There was also much force in his objection against the character of Yazid.

    "text": "<p>\\n    On the death of Umar, there was again a crisis in the matter of the election of the Caliph. In the matter of the election of the Caliph there was a tie between Ali and Uthman. Abdur Rahman b Auf who was virtually acting as the Chairman of the Board of Electors gave his verdict in favor of Uthman and Uthman accordingly became the Caliph. Ali did not feel happy at being passed over. Ali continued to be a member of\\n   </p><p>\\n    Majlis-i-Shura, but it appears the Majlis-i-Shura was not very active in the time of Uthman. During his caliphate Uthman had to depend on advice from other sources as well.\\n   </p><p>\\n    From the accounts that have come down to us, it appears that Ali played no conspicuous role in the early years of the caliphate of Othrnan. During the early years of his caliphate, Uthman enjoyed considerable popularity with the people, and Ali had practically no part to play. In the later part of the caliphate of Uthman, when agitation began against Uthman, Ali came into the picture.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Unfortunately the accounts which have come down to us in this respect are colored, and prompted by partisan interests. Ali played the role of a mediator, but it is not clear what exactly was the nature of the part that Ali played. According to the most common account it appears that Ali arrived at some terms with the rioters, which Uthman undertook to fulfil, but that Uthman went back on such undertaking. Thereupon Ali is reported to have parted company with Uthman for his breach of faith. These accounts are obviously the work of such persons who somehow or the other justify the assassination of Uthman. According to my research, there was no understanding between the rioters and Ali. Uthman gave no undertaking, and as such there was no breach of faith on the part of Uthman.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ali commanded respect with the rioters, but it is not correct that they were under his command or they obeyed him in all matters. Ali posted his sons Hasan and Hussain to stand guard at the house of Hadrat\\n   </p><p>\\n    Uthman. That shows that there was no straining of relationship between Ali and Uthman because of an alleged breach of faith on the part of Uthman. As a matter of fact it was when Hasan was wounded in the defense of Uthman that the rioters decided to hurry up with the murder of Uthman, lest the Hashimite might come to fight to help the cause of Hasan. It appears that Ali had no control over the rioters. What happens in such cases of mob revolt, scenes of perfect rowdyism prevailed and this was something beyond the control of Ali. Both Ali and Uthman were great souls. They were most eminent Muslims and may God bless their souls. It is unfortunate that some writers because of partisan considerations have tried to create the impression that there were strained relations between Ali and Uthman and they worked in opposite camps. That is far from the truth There was no love lost between Uthman and Ali, but unfortunately things got out of control and neither Uthman, nor Ali could avert the crisis. It may be recalled that Ali had no political power; he could exercise moral pressure only, and in a crisis when a mob is a victim of rowdyism, moral pressure cannot go a long way in making the people see the light of reason.\\n   </p><p>\\n    My analysis of the situation is that in this crisis, Ali did not play any active role. His role was of peripheral character. The version that Ali commanded any influence with the rioters is not correct. The rioters were in no mood to follow reason and as such they could not be under the influence of a man like Ali.\\n   </p>"

He deposed most of the Governors not because of any lapse on their part, but because he did not want them to become more powerful. He deposed Khalid b Walid from the supreme command of the Muslim army, lest the people should have an impression that all their victories were because of the genius of Khalid b Walid. Umar was not only harsh with other people; he was harsh even with himself and his family members. As such even when the people felt bitter at the harshness of Umar they could not dare complain.

    "text": "<p>\\n    Uthman was temperamentally democrat, kind, liberal and generous. He could not therefore maintain the autocratic policies followed by Umar. Uthman relaxed most of the restrictions that had been imposed on the people by Umar. He allowed the Companions to leave Madina at their discretion. He allowed the Arabs to acquire lands in conquered territories. Uthman removed the restrictions on trade. Consequently the Quraish amassed considerable fortune. With such fortune the Quraish acquired large estates in Iraq. That caused some discontentment among the Iraqis. Realizing the importance of agricultural lands, the army raised the demand that the lands in the conquered territories should be distributed among them. Uthman deposed some Governors because of the requirements of the State. Profiting from the kinds nature of Uthman the deposed functionaries collected groups of people round them, and they began to indulge in the criticism of Uthman. Availing of the freedoms that had been allowed under Uthman some movements were launched. e.g. the movement of Ibn Saba which aimed at the subversion of Islam from within.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Under Uthman, the people became economically more prosperous and on the political plane they came to enjoy a larger degree of freedom. No institutions were devised to channelize political activity, and in the absence of such institutions, the pre-Islamic tribal jealousies and rivalries which had been suppressed under Islam erupted once again. The people ceased to see things from the higher Islamic point of view; they came to be prompted by personal and parochial considerations. Differences between the Quraish and the Ansar grew sharper. While the older generation among the Ansar preferred to remain quiet, the younger generation among the Ansar became restive, and they felt dissatisfied at the dominance of the Quraish. Among the Quraish, the differences between the Umayyads and the Hashimite became threatening in character. The Bedouin Arabs chafed at the centralization of power at Madina. With the extension in conquests, population grew, and then on Arabs joined the fold of Islam in large numbers. Differences grew between the Muslims and the non-Muslims, the Arabs and the non-Arabs. With the growth of population and economic prosperity cities grew. The unscrupulous elements made the cities the hot beds of sedition and discontentment. Under Uthman Fustat, Kufa, and Basra became the three principal centers from where revolt was led against Uthman.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In view of the democratic and liberal policies adopted by Uthman the liberties allowed to the people soon degenerated into licence, and such licence became a headache for the State which culminated in the assassination of Uthman. Uthman fell a victim to the tyrannies of his people not because his rule was tyrannical or unjust, but because in advance of his time, he aspired to be kind and liberal in an age suited for an autocratic rule alone. When the caliphate later gave place to a hereditary monarchical order that was a confession of the fact that in that age of autocracy the caliphate system based on the principles of democracy and liberalism could not prosper.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Nothing succeeds like success and nothing fails like failure. As the caliphate of Uthman ended with his assassination we are precluded from concluding that Uthman's policies were successful. The blame for the failure of such policies, however, does not lie on Uthman. He was a well meaning noble hearted Muslim, and he acted in the best interests of Islam and the State. If in spite of his good intentions he failed as a ruler that was due to the fact that he was in advance of the times and was too democrat, too liberal, and too virtuous.\\n   </p>"

To his recension of the Quran we owe the present correct edition of the Book. On account of a verse in the Holy Quran he considered it a sacred duty to help his relatives. He put them in important public offices and gave them large sums of money out of the public treasury. Taking advantage of his kind and mild nature his unworthy relatives, several of whom were Governors of provinces, committed acts of high handedness end injustice which caused discontent. Being faced by strong and even armed opposition he would at times consent to their dismissal, though not convinced of the necessity of the step. As soon as such opposition ceased he would withdraw his consent. He was however willing to punish those responsible for specific complaints though he declined to dismiss them wholesale or to deliver them to blind fury. With equal magnanimity he declined to employ force against the malcontents and cause unnecessary bloodshed among Muslims, but with awful coolness, uncommon courage and exemplary self-sacrifice he laid down his own life to allay the fury of the rebels. But for his mildness which leaned to the virtue's side, he would have been an ideal ruler of men. As a private individual his character was simply adorable.\"\\n   </p>"

These writers have purposely or otherwise projected the view that Uthman was himself virtuous and honest and the Umayyads who were close to Uthman were his evil genius, Sir William Muir's view is that such allegations are frivolous, and are merely due to party calumny.\\n   </p><p>\\n    We do not have many books about the biography of Uthman. In Pakistan only two books in Urdu are available on the subject. One is a book by Raza Misri and the other is a book by Taha Hussain. Taha Hussain has not furnished much of biographical details about Uthman. A greater part of the book is devoted to the justification of the agitation against Uthman.

As the caliphate of Uthman came to an end in chaos and confusion culminating in his assassination, we cannot regard his rule as a Caliph to be a success. As a man Uthman was not liable to any reproach; he was an embodiment of all the good qualities that a good Muslim should have. He was, however, not successful as a ruler. That was not so because of any lapse or weakness on his part; that was so because he was ahead of the times. Umar, his predecessor, ruled with a strong hand, and in this way, he kept the democratic tendencies of the Arabs under control. Uthman tried to rule as a democrat, and in the absence of any safeguards to restrain the people from indulging in false propaganda, the liberties of the people degenerated into licence, and brought the Muslim polity to grief. Uthman did not succeed as the Caliph not because he was weak or he favored his relatives, but because he was kind to the people, and the people took undue advantage of his kindness.\\n   </p>"

Uthman did not yield to such pressure and remained firm and steadfast in his faith in Islam. When in his last days, Uthman was besieged by the rioters in his house at Madina he was assured that if he abdicated no physical harm would come to him. He refused to abdicate because he held that he could not divest himself of the robe with which God had vested him. He preferred to lay down his life rather than compromise with the principles for which he stood.\\n   </p>"

The caliphate of Uthman is a crucial period in the history of early Islam, and we have to reflect why in spite of the eminence of Uthman, his caliphate was not as successful as it should have been, and why it culminated in the tragedy of the assassination of the Caliph?\\n   </p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n    In this connection the fIrst point to be considered is, whether Uthman is to be blamed in any way for the sins of omission or commission that led to the tragedy. In the earlier part of this book I have referred to all the allegations that were levelled against Uthman. Uthman in his address delivered on the occasion of the Hajj in 655 C.E. dealt with all such allegations, and refuted them with due argument. The explanation offered by Uthman is most convincing, and must be accepted by every person who studies these events objectively. It may also be recalled that when Uthman made a liberal contribution towards the financing of the expedition to Tabuk, the Holy Prophet said that Uthman was not to be judged for anything thereafter. This does not mean that Uthman had been given the licence to indulge in any sins of omission and commission and was to be immune to judgement. This merely meant that whatever Uthman did later, no blame was to rest on him. In view of this verdict of the Holy Prophet, it does not lie in the mouth of any Muslim writer to pass any judgment on the alleged sins of omission and commission on the part of Uthman, I am aware of the fact that apart from the Shia writers, even the Sunni writers have found fault with Uthman in some way or the other. I am of the confirmed view that in view of what the Holy Prophet said, no Muslim, writer has the authority to impute any blame to Uthman for his alleged sins of omission or commision. As such it must be held that in the crisis that overwhelmed the Muslim community during the caliphate of Uthman, no blame rested on him.\\n   </p>"

Surprisingly in all the accounts that have come down to us, there is no mention of such demands in specific terms. The agitators made vague, confusing, and conflicting demands. If the available accounts are analyzed, it appears that the main demand was about the deposition of the Governors. In Egypt the demand was that Abdullah b Sa'ad should be deposed. No specific allegations were made against him. When it was pointed out that under him the revenues of the province had been increased, it was observed that the young ones of the she camel had been starved, which implies that the process of tax collection had been oppressive. It was, however, never brought out where lay the oppression. When the rule of Abdullah b Sa'ad came to an end in Egypt with the capture of power by Muhammad b Abu Hudhaifa, the agitation did not subside; on the other hand it burst into armed revolt.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In Kufa, the people demanded that Saeed b A1 'Aas  should be deposed, and Abu Musa Asha'ari be appointed as the Governor. Uthman accepted the demand. l he new Governor secured an undertaking from the people that they would no longer indulge in agitation. In spite of that they continued their agitation. This shows that the real object of the agitators was not to secure the deposition of Governors, their main purpose was to create unrest and confusion.\\n   </p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n    When what happened in Kufa is studied analytically we get some idea as to what was at the bottom of the agitation. When Saeed b A1 'Aas  was the Governor of Kufa he held a gathering at his house every night which was attended by the principal citizens. At one of the meetings some one expressed the wish that certain lands in Iraq were assigned to Saeed b A1 'Aas  so that he could indulge in charity. This was apparently an innocent wish, but it led to violence and exchange of blows. This shows that the people of Kufa were very sensitive in the matter of the ownership of land in conquered territories.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The background of the matter is that the soldiers demanded that like other booty, lands should also be distributed among the soldiers of the conquering army. Umar did not accept the proposal. He laid down that the land left by the non-Muslims should become State property. Uthman followed the policy laid down by Umar. Umar had laid down restrictions on the purchase of such property. Uthman relaxed those restriction, and any one could purchase such land. Most of the land in Iraq had been purchased by the Quraish and that led Saeed b Al 'Aas to observe that Sawad was the garden of the Quraish. That was resented by the people of Kufa and they resorted to agitation. When the matter was reported to Uthman he directed that the ring leaders be sent to Syria. In his book Uthman, Taha Hussain has found fault with this order of Uthman. He has held that the punishment of exile was severer than imprisonment and the cutting of hands and feet. I fail to understand the logic in the argument of Taha Hussain. It is not understood how the sending of certain agitators from one part of the country to another as a corrective measure could be severer than imprisonment and even the cutting of hands and feet. In Syria Amir Muawiyah tried to make these people see the light of reason but he failed. Then they were sent to \"Jazira\". Abdur Rahman the ruler of Jazira dealt with these people harshly, and they repented. Ashtar, their leader, next went to Madina where he repented before Uthman. Uthman allowed him to return to Kufa. What these people really wanted was that lands in conquered territories should be distributed among the soldiers of the conquering army. When they repented, this implied that they had withdrawn their demand. Thus when in 656 C.E., the people from Kufa marched to Madina to put pressure on Uthman, they had no demand to present; they were merely agitating for the sake of agitation.\\n   </p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n    In his book on Uthman, Taha Hussain has quoted a letter addressed by Ashtar, the rebel of Kufa, to Uthman. On the strength of this letter, Taha Hussain argues that the rebels did not deny the authority of Uthman; they merely wanted the government to be just and fair.\\n   </p><p>\\n    This letter is quoted hereunder: \"From Malik b Harith (Ashtar) to the Caliph who is guilty and blameworthy; who has strayed from the path of the Holy Prophet, and who has neglected the Holy Quran.\\n   </p><p>\\n    We have read your letter. Your rulers should refrain from being tyrannical. They should not exile the citizens. We agree to be loyal to you. You are under the impression that we have acted unjustly. This is your misconception that has hurled you in the precipice, whereby tyranny appears as justice to you, and falsehood looks as the truth to you. Refrain from being unjust to our people; do not exile them from their cities, and do not appoint your favorites as our Governors. Repent before God and appoint Abdullah b Qais, or Abu Musa Asha'ari, or Hudhaifa as our Governor. We are happy with these persons. Save us from your Walid, your Saeed, and other men of your family.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    It is very strange that on the basis of this letter. Taha Hussain supports the stand of the rebels, and finds fault with Uthman. This is most unfair and uncharitable. A mere glance at the letter will show that it is coached in most disrespectful language. At the outset, Ashtar has expressed in very strong terms his want of confidence in Uthman by referring to him as guilty, blameworthy, one who has strayed from the right path, and one who has neglected the Quran. Nothing could be more disrespectful to the authority of the Caliph, and after expressing such no-confidence it was preposterous to hold that they were loyal to him. The trend of the letter clearly betrays that the rebels were bent on mischief, and they wanted to create disorder on one pretext or the other.\\n   </p><p>\\n    After reading the above letter I have arrived at the conclusion that the rebels had no real grievance against the Government; they were merely spearheading a subversive movement, at the instance of powers hostile to Islam. Those who raised the bogey of tyranny and injustice on the part of Uthman or his Government were merely playing in the hands of the enemies of Islam.\\n   </p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n    We have next to ask the question: if the agitation against Uthman was a conspiracy against Islam why did Uthman not take steps to crush it with force? No hard and fast answer can be given to this question but some probabilities can be attempted. At that stage of the history of Islam, the State was organized to deal with the enemy from without; it lacked the organization to deal with the enemy from within. Within the country the State rested on the moral authority of Islam and even no Police had been organized. The State had armed forces, but the task of the army was to fight the non-Muslims, across the border. Uthman was averse to use the army for the purposes of civil war amongst the Muslims. Uthman did all he could to use the moral force at his disposal. He explained his position at great length. He categorically refuted all the allegations levelled against him. When in spite of that the agitation persisted, Uthman willingly offered his own life rather than summon any force to his aid and thereby involve the people in bloodshed and civil war. This is a unique case in history. No other ruler in history ever refused to use force for self-defense. In refusing the use of force for self-defense, Uthman set up admirable example of self-sacrifice. This trait of the character of Uthman has not been fully brought out in the accounts that have come down to us. It is necessary that this aspect of the character of Uthman should be understood in proper perspective, and Uthman should be honored as one of the greatest heroes of Islam. He sacrificed his life for he did not like to shed the blood of other Muslims merely to protect him. This assures for Uthman a high ranking place among the great Muslims.\\n   </p>"

The Arabs were individualists and highly democratic. Democracy unless effectively controlled is apt to degenerate into licence. That was exactly the position in the pre-Islamic era of ignorance. The Holy Prophet introduced a new order, \"hereunder the democratic urges of the people were effectively controlled by the moral injunctions of Islam, and the exemplary character of the Holy Prophet. After the death of the Holy Prophet, the moral influence of the Holy Prophet was no longer available. The Holy Prophet was succeeded by Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr was known as a kind hearted man' but as Caliph he followed a stern line of action. Even when men like Umar advised that the offer of the tribes not to pay Zakat be accepted, Abu Bakr took the stand that if Zakat was withheld, he would fight. That saved the situation. The apostasy campaigns were over within a year, and the whole of Arabia was won back for Islam. Umar who followed Abu Bakr was already known for his hot temper. He kept the people under strict control, and as such during his caliphate the democratic urges of the people could not degenerate into a licence. Uthman was liberal, soft spoken and kind hearted. Under Uthman there was a relaxation of control, and because of such relaxation, the democratic urges of the people degenerated into licence, and there was a recrudescence of the values of the days of ignorance which Islam had taken pains to suppress.\\n   </p>"

We cannot impute any blame to Uthman in this behalf for the simple reason that this issue has not been satisfactorily resolved during the last fourteen hundred years, and the dilemma of democracy continues to be as serious and grave today as it was in the time of Uthman.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The dilemma of democracy is that while at individual level the Muslims are the most democratic people in the world, at the collective level democracy has practically failed in almost all the Muslim countries in the world. In the course of Islamic history when there was a strong ruler he maintained law and order and kept the democratic urges of the people under control. This evoked reaction and the people led the struggle for the restoration of liberties. - With the restoration of liberties, democratic urges of the people once again degenerated into licence. Things have thus moved in a vicious circle, and history has witnessed a succession of dictatorships, and loose democratic rule creating problems of law and order.\\n   </p><p>\\n    It is unfortunate that we have so far not evolved a political system \"hereunder a proper balance could be maintained between the democratic urges of the people, and the requirements of law and order. This unsatisfactory state of affairs is not peculiar to Islam; it applies to secular orders as well. As a matter of fact the so called democracy of the western pattern is a spent force. The need of the day is to evolve a new political system based on the principles of Islam. In the Holy Quran, Allah has referred to the Muslim community as the best community among mankind. The lesson that is brought out by the life story of Uthman is that we should create a new political order \"hereunder proper balance is maintained between liberty and authority according to the principles of Islam. I visualize that the day is not far when the Muslims would once again assume the leadership of the world, and sponsor a political system which is a happy synthesis of liberty and authority.
