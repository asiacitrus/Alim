Al-Fatiha teaches that the best thing for a man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis to pray for \"Guidance towards the Right Way\" and to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstudy the Qur'an with the mental attitude of a seeker of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruth, and to recognize that the Rabb of the Universe is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe source of all knowledge.

Al-Fatiha\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the prayer from the devotee and the rest of the Qur'an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the answer from Allah. The devotee prays to Allah to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshow the \"Right Way\" and Allah places the whole of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an before him in answer to his prayer, as if to say:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"This is the Guidance that you have asked for\".\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

concerning social, cultural,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teconomic, political and legal issues through addressing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Jews who were acquainted with the Unity of Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood, Revelation, the Hereafter and angels. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJews professed to believe in the law which was revealed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Allah to their Prophet Moses (pbuh), and in principle,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir religion was the same (Islam) that was being taught\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the Prophet Muhammad ( pbuh). Although they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toriginally Muslims, they had swerved from the real Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand made innovations and alterations to their religion.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs a result they had fallen victims to hair splitting and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsectarianism, so much so that they had even given up\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir original name \"Muslim\" and adopted the name \"Jew\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstead, and made religion the monopoly of the children\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Israel. This was their religious condition when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet went to Al-Madinah and invited the Jews to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTrue Religion. More than one third of this Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taddresses to the Children of Israel. A critical review of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir history, moral degeneration and religious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperversions has been made, to draw clear lines of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemarcation between the essentials and nonessentials of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe True Religion. The Jews are warned not to mix up the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTruth with Falsehood.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDuring this period, a new type of Muslim called\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Munafiqin\" (hypocrite), had emerged. There were some who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad entered the fold of Islam merely to harm it from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithin. There were others who were surrounded by Muslims,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand had become \"Muslims\" to safeguard their worldly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterests. They, therefore, continued to have relations\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the enemies so that if the latter became successful,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir interests would remain secure. Allah has,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore, briefly pointed out the characteristics of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites in this Surah. Later on when their mischievous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeeds became manifest, detailed instructions were given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Surah Al-Taubah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah is an invitation towards the Divine Guidance.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAll of its stories, examples and incidents revolve round\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis central theme. This Surah particularly addresses the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJews and cites many events from their history to admonish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand advise them that accepting the Guidance revealed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is to their own advantage.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey should, therefore, be the first to accept it because\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Message is basically the same as that revealed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet Musa (Moses) pbuh.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Similarly, in this Surah, the Christians\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare admonished to give up their erroneous beliefs and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept the guidance of the Qur'an. At the same time, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims are instructed to nourish the virtues that may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenable them to carry out their obligation of spreading\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Divine guidance.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe believers had met with all sorts of trials and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thardships about which they were forewarned in Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Baqarah. Though they had come out victorious in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBattle of Badr, they were not out of danger yet. Their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvictory had aroused the enmity of all those powers in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia which were opposed to the Islamic movement.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThreatening events had begun to appear on all sides and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims were in a perpetual state of fear and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanxiety. This state of emergency was also adversely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffecting its economy which had already been badly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisturbed by the influx of Muslim refugees from other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplaces.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Jewish clans, who lived in the suburbs of Al-Madinah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstarted discarding the treaties of alliance which they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad made with the Prophet at his arrival from Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey had discarded the treaties to the extent that during\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Battle of Badr, these \"People of the Book\" sided with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mushrik Qureysh (in spite of the fact that their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfundamental Articles of Faith - such as Oneness of Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood and life after death - were the same as those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Muslims). After the Battle of Badr, they openly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegan to approach various Arab clans against the Muslims.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe magnitude of the peril may be judged from the fact\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat even the life of the Prophet himself was always in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdanger. His Companions used to sleep in their armor and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkeep watch at night to guard against any sudden attack.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhenever the Prophet happened to be out of sight even for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta short while, they would at once set out in search of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJews even approached the Qureysh and challenged their ego\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto avenge the defeat they had suffered at Badr and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpromised to help them from within. As a result the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh marched against Al-Madinah with an army of 3000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twarriors and a battle took place at the foot of mount\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUhud. The Prophet started out of Al-Madinah with one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthousand men to fight the enemy. While they were marching\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the battlefield, three hundred hypocrites deserted the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarmy and returned to Al- Madinah to discourage the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers. A small band of hypocrites, however, remained\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the seven hundred who accompanied the Prophet. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplayed their part and did their best to create mischief\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand chaos in the ranks of the Believers during the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbattle. This was the first clear indication of the fact\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat within the fold of the Muslim community there was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquite a large number of saboteurs who were always ready\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto conspire with the external enemies to harm their own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrethren.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese devices of the hypocrites played a major role in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe setback at Uhud, even though the weaknesses of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims also contributed to it. The Muslims were a new\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommunity, formed on a new ideology and had not as yet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgotten thorough moral training. Naturally in this second\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thard test of their physical and moral strength, some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tweaknesses came to the surface. That is why a detailed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcritical review of the Battle of Uhud is made in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah which was needed to warn the Muslims of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshortcomings and to issue instructions for their reform.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatus of women in the society is determined and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeclaration about the rights of orphans is made. Laws and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregulations are laid down for the distribution of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinheritance. Instructions are given to reform the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teconomic system. The foundation of criminal laws is laid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown. Drinking is prohibited. Instructions are given for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcleanliness and purification. The Muslims are taught what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkind of relations they should have with their Rabb and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith their fellow human beings. Instructions are given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the maintenance of discipline in the Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommunity.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe moral and religious condition of the People of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBook is reviewed to teach lessons to the Muslims, and a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twarning is given to refrain from following in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfootsteps. The distinctive features of hypocrisy and true\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaith are clearly marked for easy identification between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe two. The setback in the Battle of Uhud had enabled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mushrik Arab clans, the neighboring Jews, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites in Al-Madinah to threaten the Muslims from all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsides. At this critical stage, Allah's grace filled the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims with courage and gave them the necessary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstructions during that period. In order to counteract\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fearful rumors that were being spread by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites, they were asked to make a thorough inquiry\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout their accuracy and then inform the appropriate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleadership. Muslims were experiencing difficulties in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffering their Salah during the expeditions when water\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas not available to perform ablution. In such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcircumstances Allah granted a permission to make Tayammum\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(purification with clean earth), and to shorten the Salah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor to offer the \"Salat-ul-Khauf,\" when they were faced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith danger. Instructions were also given to those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims who were living in the enemy camps that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould migrate to Al-Madinah, the Islamic State.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tClear instructions are also given regarding the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites and nonbelligerent clans. On one hand, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuperiority of Islamic morality and culture is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablished over that of the Jews, Christians and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmushrikin; on the other hand, their incorrect religious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcepts, immorality, and evil actions are criticized to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprepare the ground for inviting them to the Right Way.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Now Islam was not merely a creed which ruled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover the minds and hearts of the people, but had also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome a State which was regulating the lives of people.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, there was a need to formulate Islamic civil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand criminal laws in detail and enforce them through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic courts. New and reformed ways of trade and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommerce were needed to replace the old. Likewise,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic laws of marriage and divorce, segregation of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsexes, and punishment for adultery, were needed to mold\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe social life of Muslims. This Surah provided the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguidelines to the believers in some of these aspects of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir lives so that their social behavior, conversation,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdress, way of life and culture could take a definite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshape of its own. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe treaty of Hudeybiyah was also signed in the same year\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich gave the Muslims not only peace in their own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterritory but, also respite to spread the Message of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam in the surrounding territories. The Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrote letters to the rulers of Iran, Egypt, and Rome and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Chiefs of Arabia, inviting them to Islam. At the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame time the missionaries of Islam spread among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclans and tribes and invited them to accept the Divine\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessage of Al-Islam.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow that the Muslims had become a ruling body, it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfeared that power might corrupt them. At this period of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreat trial, Allah had admonished them over and over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagain to stick to justice and to guard against the wrong\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehavior of their predecessors, the People of the Book.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBelievers are enjoined to remain steadfast to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCovenant of Obedience to Allah and His Rasool.

However, the Muslims had not yet had an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topportunity to demonstrate practically the blessings of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe system of life based on Islam. There was neither any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic culture, nor any social, economic or political\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsystem; nor were there any established principles of war\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand peace. Therefore the Muslims had no opportunity for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemonstrating those moral principles on which they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintended to build their entire system of life; nor had it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen proved on the touchstone of trial that the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas a community were sincere in their proclamation of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage. Allah created opportunities for making up these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeficiencies in Al-Madinah. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe people of Makkah had realized that Muhammad (pbuh),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho had a great personality and possessed extraordinary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabilities, was going to gain a strong footing in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah. This would help integrate his followers -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhose constancy, determination, and unwavering fidelity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Al-Islam had been tried - into a disciplined community\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunder his wise leadership and guidance. They knew that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis would spell death for their old ways of life. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso realized the strategic importance of Al-Madinah to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir trade, which was their main source of livelihood.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Muslims could strike at the caravans travelling on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe trade route between Yaman and Syria, and thus strike\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat the root of their economy. The value of the trade done\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the people of Makkah on this route amounted to about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo hundred thousand dinars annually. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Sh'aban, 2 A. H. (February or March, 623 A. D.) a big\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade caravan of the Qureysh , on its way back from Syria\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcarrying goods worth over 50,000 dinars with a guard of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthirty to forty men, reached the territory from where it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould be easily attacked from Al-Madinah. As soon as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaravan entered the dangerous territory, Abu Sufyan, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaravan's leader, despatched a camel rider to Makkah with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta frantic appeal for help. This caused great excitement\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand anger at Makkah. An army of approximately 1000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twarriors with great pomp and show marched towards\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah. They intended not only to rescue the caravan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut also to put an end to the rising power of the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand overawe the clans surrounding the route so as to make\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit absolutely secure for future trade. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Prophet, who always kept himself well informed, felt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the hour had come to take a bold step; otherwise the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic Movement would become lifeless with no chance to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trise again. The condition of the Muslim community was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstill very shaky because the Muslim immigrants from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah (Muhajirin) had not been able to stabilize their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teconomy; their helpers from the natives of Madinah, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecame Muslims after the Prophet and his followers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmigrated there from Makkah (the Ansar), had not yet been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttried; and the neighboring Jewish clans could not be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrusted. Above all, the surrounding clans lived in awe of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qureysh and had all their religious sympathies with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem. Therefore, the consequences of the coming attack\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould not be favorable to the Muslims. A careful study of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe situation indicated to the Prophet that he should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttake a decisive step and go into the battle with whatever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrength he could muster and demonstrate whether the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim community had the ability to survive or was doomed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto perish.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Holy Prophet's analysis of the situation was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupported by Divine inspiration, therefore, he called the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhajir and the Ansar to a meeting and placed the whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsituation, without any reservation, before them, saying:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Allah has promised that you will confront one of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo, the trade caravan coming from the north or the army\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Qureysh marching from the south. Now, tell me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich of the two you would like to confront!\" The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmajority of the people replied that they should go for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe caravan. When the Prophet repeated the same question,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMiqdad bin 'Amr, a Muhajir, stood up and said: \"O Rasool\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah! Please march in the direction which Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommands you; we will accompany you wherever you go. We\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill not say like the Israelites: 'Go you and your Rabb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand fight, we will wait.' In contrast to them we say:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Let you and your Rabb decide; we will fight by your side\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto our last breath.'\" Even then, he did not announce any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecision, but waited for a reply from the Ansar who had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot yet taken any part in any confrontation for Islam. As\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis was the first opportunity for them to prove that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were ready to fulfill their promise of fighting for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe cause of Islam, he repeated the question without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdirectly addressing them. At this, Sa'ad bin Mu'az, an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnsar, stood up and said: \"O Rasool of Allah, it appears\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat you are addressing this question to us.\" When the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet said, \"Yes,\" he replied, \"We have believed in you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand confirmed that what you have brought is the truth,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand have made a solemn pledge with you that we will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlisten to you and obey you. Therefore, O Rasool of Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo whatever you intend to do. We swear by Allah Who has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsent you with the truth that we are ready to accompany\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou to the seashore and if you enter it, we will plunge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto it. We assure you that not a single one of us will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremain behind or forsake you, for we will not hesitate at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall to go to fight, even if you should lead us to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbattlefield tomorrow. We will, Insha Allah (Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twilling), remain steadfast in the battle and sacrifice\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tour lives for Islam. We do hope that by the grace of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah our behavior will gladden your heart. So, trusting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Allah's blessing, take us to the battlefield.\" After\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis it was decided that they would march towards the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarmy of the Qureysh and not towards the trade caravan. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe number of people who came forward to go to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbattlefield was only a little more than three hundred (86\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhajirin, 62 from Aus, and 170 from Khazraj). Over and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove that, this little army was ill-armed and hardly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tequipped for battle. Only a couple of them had horses to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tride and the others had to take their turn in threes or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfours on camel back. They had a total of 70 camels. Above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall, they did not even have enough weapons for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbattle; only 60 of them had armor. They marched straight\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the southwest, wherefrom the army of the Qureysh was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcoming. This is also an indication that, from the very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeginning, they had gone out to fight with the army and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot to plunder the caravan. If they had aimed at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplundering the caravan they would have taken the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnorth-westernly direction rather than the southwest. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo parties met in combat at Badr on the seventeenth day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Ramadhan. When the two armies confronted each other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Prophet noticed that the Qureysh army outnumbered\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims by three to one and was much better equipped,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the raised his hands up in supplication and made this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearnest prayer with great humility: \"O Allah! Here are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qureysh proud of their war material: they have come\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto prove that Your Rasool is false. O Allah! Now send the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelp that You have promised me. O Allah! If this little\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarmy of Your devotees is destroyed, then there will be no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone left in the land to worship You.\" \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this combat the emigrants from Makkah were put to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thardest test because they had to fight against their own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelatives, putting to the sword their fathers, sons,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrothers, and uncles. It is obvious that only such people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould do this who had accepted the truth sincerely and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcut off all relations with falsehood. Similarly, the test\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto which the Ansar were put was not less hard. So far the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnsar had only alienated the powerful Qureysh and their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallies by giving shelter to the Muslims against their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twishes but now, for the first time, they were going to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgive fight to them and to sow the seeds of a long and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbitter war with them. This meant that a small town of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfew thousand inhabitants was going to wage a war with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole of Arabia. It is obvious that only such people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould take a stand who believed in the Truth of Islam so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirmly that they were ready to sacrifice every personal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterest for its sake. Allah accepted these sacrifices of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muhajirin and the Ansar because of their true faith,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand rewarded them with His help through angels.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe proud, well-armed Qureysh were defeated by these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\till-equipped devotees of Islam. Seventy men of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh army were killed and seventy captured as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprisoners of war. Their arms and equipment came into the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thands of the Muslims as spoils of war. All their big\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchiefs, who were their best soldiers and who had led the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topposition to Islam, were killed in this battle. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecisive victory made Islam a power to be reckoned with.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

A decree was issued to crush the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnon-Muslim powers and force them to accept the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsovereignty of the Islamic State. The object of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJihad was not to coerce them to accept Islam, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were free to accept or not accept it. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tobject was to allow them the freedom to remain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmisguided, if they chose to be so, provided that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthey paid Jizya, the protection tax (v. 29), as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsign of their subjugation to the Islamic State.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTo ensure the stability of the Islamic State,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgangs of the hypocrites who were being tolerated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin spite of their flagrant crimes, were crushed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Muslims were enjoined to treat them openly as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers (v. 73).

The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvitation is to accept the Message of Allah, obey the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet of Allah, discard shirk, and worship Allah alone.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLive your life in this world keeping in mind that you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshall be held accountable for all of your actions on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDay of Judgement. The admonition is given through the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texample of those people who put their faith in and used\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir efforts for this worldly life and rejected the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage of the Prophets. As a result, they met the evil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequences of their rejection. Therefore, people are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadvised to think seriously about whether or not they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould follow the way of the arrogant, which history has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproved to be the way to destruction. The warning is given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the disbelievers that they should not be deluded by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe delay in the punishment of their misdeeds. The delay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis only because of the respite that Allah has granted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem, by His grace, to mend their ways. If they do not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake use of this opportunity, they shall be inflicted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith an inevitable punishment that will destroy all of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem except the believers. Al-Qur'an has used the stories\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the people of Nuh, Hud, Saleh, Lut, Shu'aib and Musa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto achieve this purpose. The most prominent feature of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese stories is to spell out how Allah passes His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjudgement on the people, He does not spare any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbeliever even if he/she may be a nearest relative of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet of the time. The stories of Nuh and Lut clearly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttell that even the Prophet's own son and wife were not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspared for being disbelievers. Therefore, the believers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould remember that real relationship is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelationship of faith.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

It was a time when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh were considering the question of killing,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texiling, or imprisoning him. The Jews instigated the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunbelievers to test the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) by asking\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim: \"Why did the Israelites go to Egypt?\" The history of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Israelites was not known to the Arabs, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet had no means knowing their traditions. Therefore,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey thought that the Prophet would not be able to give a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsatisfactory answer, and thus, would be totally exposed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut, contrary to their expectations, the tables were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tturned on them, when Allah revealed the whole story of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) then and there. To their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tastonishment, the Prophet recited it to them on the spot.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis put the Qureysh in a very awkward position because,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit not only ruined their scheme, but also warned them by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapplying the example of Yusuf's brothers to their case,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas to say, \"As you are behaving towards this Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texactly in the same way the brothers of the Prophet Yusuf\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehaved towards him; therefore, you should expect to meet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the same end.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Major Issues, Divine Laws, and Guidance</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAll Rasools were human beings.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYusuf's prayer to live and die as a Muslim.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe faith of Prophets Ibrahim (Abraham), Ishaq (Isaac),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYa'qoob (Jacob) and Yusuf (Joseph), may Allah's peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tupon them all, was the same as that of the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad (pbuh) and they invited the people to the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMessage to which Muhammad (pbuh) was inviting them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCharacters moulded by Islam (based on the worship of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah and accountability in the hereafter) are compared\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto characters moulded by disbelief and ignorance (based\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ton the worship of false gods and the material world).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThen the addressees are asked to decide for themselves\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween these two patterns.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is made clear that, whatever Allah wills, He fulfills\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tit, and no one can defeat His plan or prevent it from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thappening.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe believers are advised to remain within the limits\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprescribed by Divine Law while pursuing their aims,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause success and failure are entirely in the hands of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe believers are advised to exert their efforts towards\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Truth and put their trust in Allah.

The marvellous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\texample of the Prophet Yusuf shows how a man of high and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpure character comes out successful even under the most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tadverse circumstances.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMoreover, the revelation of this Surah accomplished the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowing two objectives: \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt provided proof of Muhammad's (pbuh)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood, and that his knowledge was not based\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ton mere hearsay, but was gained through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt applied the theme of this story to the Qureysh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand warned them that ultimately the conflict\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween them and the Prophet would end in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tvictory over them. As is stated in verse 7:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Indeed there are signs in this story of Yusuf\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand his brothers for the inquirers from among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn fact, by applying this story to the conflict between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet and the Qureysh, the Qur'an had made a bold\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand clear prophecy which was fulfilled literally by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevents that happened in the succeeding ten years. Hardly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo years had passed after its revelation when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh, like the brothers of the Prophet Yusuf,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconspired to kill the Prophet forcing him to emigrate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Makkah to Al-Madinah, where he gained power similar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto that gained by the Prophet Yusuf in Egypt. Again, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe end, the Qureysh had to humble themselves before him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjust as the brothers of the Prophet Yusuf humbly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trequested, \"Show mercy to us for Allah rewards richly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who show mercy,\" (Verse 88) and the Prophet Yusuf\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgenerously forgave them - though he had complete power to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinflict his vengeance upon them. He said: \"Today no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpenalty shall be inflicted on you. May Allah forgive you.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe is the greatest of all those who forgive.\" (Verse: 92)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe same story of mercy was repeated when, after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconquest of Makkah, the defeated Qureysh stood meekly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), who had full power to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinflict his vengeance upon them for each and every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcruelty committed by them. But instead, he merely asked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem: \"What treatment do you expect from me?\" They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied, \"You are a generous brother and the son of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgenerous brother.\" At this, the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforgave them very generously, saying: \"I am giving the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame answer to your request that Yusuf gave to his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrothers: \"Today, no penalty shall be inflicted upon you:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou are forgiven.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Allah not only provided a complete answer to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir questions but also explained the three stories to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe disadvantage of the opponents of Islam.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe questioners were told that the Companions of the Cave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieved in the same doctrine of Tawhid (Oneness of God)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich was being put forward in the Qur'an and that their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition was similar to the condition of the persecuted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims of Makkah. On the other hand, the persecutors of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Companions of the Cave had behaved in the same way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttowards them as the disbelieving Qureysh were behaving\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttowards the Muslims. Besides this, the Muslims have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaught that even if a believer is persecuted by a cruel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsociety, he should not bow down before falsehood, rather\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the should migrate from that place if needed. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers of Makkah were told that the story of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Companions of the Cave was a clear proof about the life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thereafter. Allah has the power to resurrect after a long\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsleep of death as He did in case of the Companions of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCave.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe story of the Companions of the Cave is also used to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twarn the chiefs of Makkah who were persecuting the newly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformed Muslim community. At the same time, the Prophet is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing instructed that he should in no case make a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompromise with the persecutors nor should he consider\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem to be more important than his poor followers. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstory is also meant to comfort and encourage the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toppressed Muslims and relate to them how righteous people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the past saved their Faith. On the other hand, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchiefs of Qureysh are admonished that they should not be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpuffed up with this transitory life that they are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoying; rather they should seek the excellence of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thereafter which will be permanent and eternal.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

The most pitiful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvictims of their persecution were the poor people and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslaves.

You should remain there till Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovides a remedy for your affliction.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTaking advantage of this permission, eleven men and four\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen immediately left for Habash. The Qureysh pursued\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem to the coast but fortunately they escaped by getting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton a boat leaving for Habash at the seaport of Shu'aibah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter a few months, other people followed suit and their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnumber rose to eighty-three men and eleven women from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh and seven from other clans. Only forty Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere left with the Prophet at Makkah. This migration\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstarted a great hue and cry in Makkah, for there was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thardly any family of the Qureysh which did not lose a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tson, a son-in-law, a daughter, a brother or a sister.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese included the near relatives of Abu Jahl, Abu Sufyan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand other chiefs of the Qureysh who were notorious for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir persecution of the Muslims. As a result, some of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem became more bitter in their enmity toward Islam,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhile others were so moved by this that they embraced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Qureysh held a meeting and decided to send Abdullah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Abi Rabiy'ah, the half brother of Abu Jahl, and Amr\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin A's with some precious gifts to the king of Habash\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand persuade him to send the migrants back to Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSayyidah Umme Salmah, who became a wife of the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlater on and was among the migrants, related their story\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin detail. She says: \"When these two clever statesmen of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qureysh reached Habash, they distributed the gifts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the courtiers of the king and persuaded them to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupport their request to send the migrants back. Then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey approached Negus, the king of Habash, presented the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpensive gifts, and said: \"Some headstrong brats of our\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcity have come to your land so our chiefs have sent us to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou with the request that you kindly send them back.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese brats have forsaken our faith, have not embraced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyours, and have invented a new faith.\" As soon as they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade their request, all the courtiers supported their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcase, saying: \"We should send such people back. It is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproper for us to keep them here.\" At this the king, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgot annoyed, said: 'I am not going to send them back\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout proper enquiry. Since those people have put their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrust in us through coming and taking shelter in my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountry rather than going to some other country, I will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot betray them. I will send for them and investigate the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallegations these people have made against them. Then I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill make my final decision.'\" So the king sent for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timmigrants to come to his court.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the immigrants received the summons from the king,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey held a meeting and after lengthy discussions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecided: 'We shall present the teachings of the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the king without adding anything to or withholding\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything from it regardless of whether he lets us remain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\there or turns us out of his country.' When they came to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe court, the king put this question abruptly: 'I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstand that you have given up the faith of your own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople and have neither embraced my faith nor any other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texisting faith but have invented a new faith. I would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike to know what your new faith is.' At this, J'afar bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbi Talib responded on behalf of the immigrants, in these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords: 'O king! We were sunk deep in ignorance and had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome very corrupt; then Muhammad (pbuh) came to us as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah and reformed us, but these Qureysh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegan to persecute us, so we have come to your country in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe hope that here we will be free from persecution.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHearing this statement, the king asked: 'Please recite a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpiece of the Revelation which your Prophet has received\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Allah.' (In response, Sayyiduna J'afar recited a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tportion of this Surah which relates to the story of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphets Yahya (John) and Isa (Jesus) may peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem.) When the king listened, he started weeping and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twept so much that his beard became wet with tears. When\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSayyiduna J'afar finished the recital, he said: 'Most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurely this Revelation and the Message brought by Jesus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave come from the same source. By God, I will not put\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou in the hands of these people.'\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNext day Amr bin A's made another attempt. He went to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tking and said: 'Please send for them again and ask them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerning the belief they hold about Jesus, for they say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta horrible thing about him.' The king again sent for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timmigrants, who had already learned about the scheme of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmr. They again held a meeting to discuss the answer they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould give to the king if he should ask about the belief\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they hold about Prophet Jesus. It was a very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcritical situation and all of them were uneasy about it;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, they decided that they would just say what Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand His Rasool had said about Jesus. The next day, when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey went to the king's court, he asked them the question\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat had been suggested by Amr bin A's.

These memories grieved them to think that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mushrikin Qureysh had debarred them from visiting the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSacred Mosque. Therefore, they might have been praying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor and expecting Divine permission to wage war against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose tyrants who had expelled them from their homes and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevented them from visiting the House of Allah. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah specifies the purpose for which the Ka'bah was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbuilt and clearly states that Hajj (pilgrimage) was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoined for the worship of the One God (Allah). But it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis an irony that it had been dedicated to the rituals of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshirk, the worship of 360 idols and the real worshippers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof One God (Allah) had been debarred from visiting it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThrough this Surah, Allah also granted the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermission to wage war against the tyrant mushrikin in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torder to oust them and establish the righteous way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife. According to Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Urwah bin Zubair,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZaid bin Aslam, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Qatadah and other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreat commentators, v. 39 is the first verse that granted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims permission to wage war. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah has also addressed the mushrikin of Makkah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe wavering Muslims, and the true believers as follows: \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe mushrikin are warned in a forceful manner in these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords: \"You have persisted in your ignorance and trusted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour deities instead of Allah, though they possess no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpower to protect you.\" They are also admonished time and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagain for their creed of shirk through providing sound\\n\\t\\t\\t\\targuments in favor of Tawhid (Oneness of God) and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe wavering Muslims, who had embraced Islam but were not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprepared to endure any hardship in its way, have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmonished in these words: \"What is this faith of yours?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYou are ready to believe in Allah and become His servants\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovided you are given peace and prosperity, but if you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeet with afflictions and hardships in His Way, you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscard Allah and cease to remain His servants. You\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould bear in mind that this wavering attitude of yours\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot avert those misfortunes and losses which Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tordained for you.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe true believers are told that the mushrikin of Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave no right to debar them from visiting the Ka'bah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey have no right to prevent anyone from performing Hajj\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause the Ka'bah is not their private property. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobjection acted as an effective political weapon against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qureysh because it posed this question: \"Are the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh mere attendants of the Ka'bah or its owners? This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestion implied that if the Qureysh succeeded in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdebarring the Muslims from Hajj without any protest from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers, they would feel encouraged in the future to debar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers who happened to have strained relations with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh. In order to emphasize this point, the history of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Ka'bah's construction is cited to show that it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbuilt by the Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) by the command of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah and he had invited all of mankind to perform Hajj.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThat is why people coming from outside Makkah had enjoyed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tequal rights with the local people from the very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeginning. It is also made clear that the House had not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen built for the rituals of shirk but for the worship\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof One Allah. Thus it was sheer tyranny that the worship\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah was being forbidden there while the worship of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tidols enjoyed full licence.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Both the parties understood well, that the war\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof aggression which the unbelievers had been waging\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst Muslims for several years, had come to an end. On\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat occasion the Prophet himself said to the believers:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"After this year, the Qureysh will not be able to attack\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou; you will take the offensive against them.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter the defeat in the Battle of the Trench the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunbelievers realized that the Muslims could not be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefeated on the battlefield and that the rise of Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas not due to the numerical strength of the Muslims nor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto their superior arms and material resources, since the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims were fighting against fearful odds on all these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfronts. Their success was due to their moral superiority.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe pure and noble qualities of the Prophet and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowers were capturing the hearts of the people, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere also binding them together into a highly disciplined\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommunity. As a result, they were defeating the mushrikin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Jews both, therefore, they chose the moral front\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto carry on the conflict.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey got the first opportunity when in Dhul-Qa'dah 5 A.H.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet married Zainab (abph), the divorced wife of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this adopted son, Zaid bin Harithah (abph). The Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarried Zainab in accordance with the commandment of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah to put an end to a custom of ignorance, which had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven the same status to the adopted son as that of a son\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom one's own loins. The hypocrites, the Jews, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmushrikin considered it a golden opportunity to exploit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe situation to vilify the Prophet and to ruin his high\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treputation with a malicious slander through concocting a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstory in the following words: \"One day Muhammad (pbuh)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappened to see the wife of his adopted son and fell in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlove with her; he maneuvered her divorce and married\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther.\" Though this was an absurd fiction, it was spread\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith such skill and cunning that it succeeded in its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurpose to the extent that some Muslim commentators also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave cited some parts of it in their writings, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torientalists have wilfully exploited it to vilify the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet. The fact is that Zainab (abph) was never a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstranger to the Prophet. She was his first cousin, being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe daughter of his real paternal aunt, Umaimah, daughter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Abdul Muttalib, his real grand father. He had known\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther from her childhood to her youth. Just one year before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis incident, he himself had persuaded her to marry Zaid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(abph), who was a slave and to whom the Prophet had freed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand then adopted as his son, this was to demonstrate that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Islam, even a freed slave has rights equal to that of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh. But Zainab (abph) could not reconcile her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpsychological reservation about marriage with a liberated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave. Therefore, she and her husband could not continue\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttogether for long, which inevitably led to their divorce.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe second slander was made on the honor of Sayyidah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAeysha (abph), a wife of the Prophet, in connection with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan incident which occurred while he was returning from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Campaign against the Bani Al-Mustaliq. This attack\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas even more severe than the first one and was the main\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason for the revelation of this Surah. The mischief\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat was engineered by Abdullah bin Ubayy through this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslander was to attack the honor of the Prophet and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSayyiduna Abu Bakr Siddiq (abph), who was the father of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSayyidah Aeysha (abph), to undermine the high moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuperiority which was the greatest asset of the Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMovement and to ignite civil war between the Muhajirin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Ansar, and between Aus and Khazraj, the two clans\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Ansar.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Laws &amp; Guidance</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah was revealed to strengthen the moral fiber of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslim society, which had been shaken by the slander\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst Sayyidah Aeysha.

But the greatest hindrance for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman's following this way, is the denial of the Hereafter.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor it makes him irresponsible, selfish, and greedy in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis worldly life, which in turn, makes it impossible for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim to submit himself to God and to accept the moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trestrictions on his lusts and desires.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this introduction, three types of character have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen presented: Examples of the first type are Fir'on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Pharaoh), his chiefs, the nation of Thamud and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of Prophet Lut (pbuh) who were all heedless of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter and consequently had become the slaves of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdesires. That's why they did not believe even after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseeing miracles. Rather, they turned against those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvited them to goodness and piety. They persisted in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir evil ways, which were abhorred by every sensible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson. They did not heed the admonition even moments\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore they were overtaken by the scourge of Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn example of the second type is Prophet Sulaiman\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Solomon) (pbuh), who had been blessed by Allah with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twealth, kingdom and grandeur far greater than the chiefs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the disbelievers of Makkah. But, since he regarded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself answerable before Allah and recognized that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhatever he had was only due to Allah's bounty, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadopted righteousness and the attitude of obedience.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn example of the third type is the Queen of Sheba, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\truled over the most wealthy and well-known people in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory of Arabia. She possessed all those means of life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich could cause a person to become proud and arrogant.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHer wealth and possessions far exceeded the wealth and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossessions of the Qureysh. She professed shirk, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas not only an ancestral way of life for her, but she\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad to follow it in order to maintain her position as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\truler. Therefore, it was much more difficult for her to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgive up shirk and adopt the way of Tawhid than it could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe for a common mushrik. But when the Truth became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevident to her, nothing could stop her from accepting it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHer deviation was, in fact, due to her being born and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrought up in a polytheistic environment, not because of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther being a slave to her lusts and desires. Her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconscience was not devoid of the sense of accountability\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe theme of the second discourse is to draw the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattention of the people to some of the most glaring and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvisible realities of the universe by asking questions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch as: \"Do the realities of the universe testify to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreed of shirk which you are following, or to the truth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Tawhid to which the Qur'an invites you?\" After this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe real malady of the disbelievers is pointed out,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying, \"The thing which has blinded them and made them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinsensitive to every reality is their denial of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter. This same thing has rendered every matter and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffair of life non-serious for them. For, according to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem, when ultimately everything has to become dust, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe whole struggle of existence is to enjoy this worldly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife then the truth and falsehood are equal and alike.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, the question of whether one's system of life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis based on right or wrong foundations becomes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaningless.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, the invitation of the Qur'an to serve One\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod (Allah) is presented in a concise but forceful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanner, and the people are admonished to accept this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvitation as being to their advantage and rejection will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe to their disadvantage. For if they deferred their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaith before they saw those signs of Allah, after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappearance of which they would be left with no choice but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto believe and submit. Then they should know that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieving at that time will be of no avail.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Then the story\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Prophet Musa (pbuh) is related to emphasize that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah is All-Powerful and can provide the means for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhatever He wills to do. He arranged for the child Musa,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough whom Fir'on was to be removed from power, to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrought up in Fir'on's own house thus Fir'on would not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknow whom he was fostering.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe unbelievers wondered about Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thow he could be blessed with Prophethood all of a sudden.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is explained through the example of the Prophet Musa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(pbuh) who was given the Prophethood unexpectedly during\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta journey, while he himself did not know what he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoing to be blessed with. In fact, he had gone to bring a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpiece of fire, but had returned with the gift of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe unbelievers were wondering why Allah would assign the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Muhammad (pbuh) this mission without any special\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelp or supernatural forces to aid him. Again, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texample of the Prophet Musa (pbuh) is used to explain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat a person from whom Allah wants to take some service\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talways appears without any apparent helper or force\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehind him, yet he can put up with much stronger and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetter-equipped opponents. The contrast between the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrengths of Musa (pbuh) and those of Fir'on is far more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textreme than that between Muhammad (pbuh) and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh; yet the whole world knows who came out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvictorious in the end and who was defeated.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe unbelievers were referring to the Prophet Musa (pbuh)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagain and again, saying: \"Why has Muhammad not been given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same which was given to Musa (pbuh)?\" That is to say,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe miracles of the Staff and the Shining Hand; as if to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuggest that they would readily believe only if they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshown the kind of the miracles that Musa (pbuh) showed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFir'on. The disbelievers are admonished, that those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere shown those miracles did not believe even after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseeing the miracles. Instead they said: \"This is nothing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut magic,\" for they were full of stubbornness and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thostility to the Truth just like the disbelievers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah. Then a warning is given by citing the fate of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who disbelieved after witnessing those miracles.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis was the background against which the story of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Musa was narrated and a perfect analogy is made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin every detail between the conditions prevailing then in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah and those which were existing at the time of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Musa (pbuh).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, the disbelievers of Makkah are admonished\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor mistreating those Christians who came to Makkah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tembraced Islam after hearing the verses of the Qur'an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the Prophet. Instead of learning a lesson from their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacceptance of Islam, the Makkans leader, Abu Jahl,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thumiliated them publicly. Then the real reason for not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieving in the Prophet is mentioned. The disbelievers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere thinking, \"If we give up the polytheistic creed of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Arabs and accept the doctrine of Tawhid (Oneness of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod), it will be an end to our supremacy in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligious, political and economic fields. As a result,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tour position as the most influential tribe of Arabia will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe destroyed and we shall be left with no refuge anywhere\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the land.\" This was the real motive of the chiefs of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qureysh for their antagonism towards the Truth, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir doubts and objections were only a pretence invented\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto deceive the common people.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Research Scholar Abul A'la\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMaududi narrated the historical background relevant to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah as follows:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Eight years before the Prophet's advent as a Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Byzantine Emperor Maurice was overthrown by Phocus,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho captured the throne and became king. Phocus first had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Emperor's five sons executed in front of him, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen had the Emperor killed and hung their heads in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthoroughfare in Constantinople. A few days after this, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad the empress and her three daughters also put to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath. The event provided Khusrau Parvez, the Sassani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tking of Persia; a good moral excuse to attack Byzantine.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmperor Maurice had been his benefactor; with his help he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad got the throne of Persia. Therefore, he declared that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the would avenge his godfather's and his children's murder\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon Phocus, the usurper. So, he started a war against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Byzantines in 603 A. D. and within a few years,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tputting the Phocus armies to rout in succession, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treached Edessa (modern, Urfa) in Asia Minor, on the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfront, and Aleppo and Antioch in Syria, on the other.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the Byzantine ministers saw that Phocus could not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsave the country, they sought the African governor's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelp, who sent his son, Hercules, to Constantinople with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta strong fleet. Phocus was immediately deposed and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHercules was made emperor. He treated Phocus as he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreated Maurice. This happened in 610 A. D., the year the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet was appointed to the Prophethood.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe moral excuse for which Khusrau Parvez had started the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twar was no more valid after the deposition and death of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPhocus. Had the object of his war really been to avenge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe murder of his ally on Phocus for his cruelty, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould have come to terms with the new Emperor after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath of Phocus. But he continued the war, and gave it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe color of a crusade between Zoroastrianism and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChristianity. The sympathies of the Christian sects (i.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\te. Nestorians and Jacobians, etc.) which had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcommunicated by the Roman ecclesiastical authority and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttyrannized for years also went with the Magian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Zoroastrian) invaders, and the Jews also joined hands\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith them; so much so that the number of Jews who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenlisted in Khusrau's army rose to 26,000.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHercules could not stop this storm. The very first news\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he received from the East after ascending the throne\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas that of the Persian's occupation of Antioch. After\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis, Damascus fell in 613 A. D. Then in 614 A.D., the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPersians occupying Jerusalem, played havoc with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChristian world. Ninety thousand Christians were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmassacred and the Holy Sepulchre was desecrated. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginal Cross on which, according to Christian beliefs,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJesus had died, was seized and carried to Mada'in. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchief priest Zacharia was taken prisoner and all the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant churches of the city were destroyed. How puffed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tup was Khusrau Parvez at this victory can be judged from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe letter that he wrote to Hercules from Jerusalem. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrote: \"From Khusrau, the greatest of all gods, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaster of the whole world : To Hercules, his most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twretched and most stupid servant: 'You say that you have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrust in your Lord. Why didn't then your Lord save\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJerusalem from me?\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWithin a year after this victory, the Persian armies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toverran Jordan, Palestine and the whole of the Sinai\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPeninsula and reached the frontiers of Egypt. In those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvery days, another conflict of a far greater historical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequence was going on in Makkah. The believers in One\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod, under the leadership of the Prophet Muhammad (may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace be upon him), were fighting for their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texistence against the followers of shirk under the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommand of the chiefs of the Qureysh, and the conflict\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad reached such a stage that in 615 A. D., a substantial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnumber of the Muslims had to leave their homes and take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefuge with the Christian kingdom of Habash, which was an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tally of the Byzantine Empire. In those days the Sassani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvictories against Byzantine were the talk of the town,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the pagans of Makkah were delighted and were taunting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims to the effect: \"Look the fire worshippers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPersia are winning victories and the Christian believers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Revelation and Prophethood are being routed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teverywhere. Likewise, we, the idol worshippers of Arabia,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill exterminate you and your religion.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese were the conditions when this Surah of the Qur'an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas sent down, and in it a prediction was made, saying:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Romans have been vanquished in the neighboring land\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand within a few years after their defeat, they shall be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvictorious. And it will be the day when the believers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill rejoice in the victory granted by Allah.\" It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontained not one but two predictions: First, the Romans\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshall be Victorious; and second, the Muslims also shall\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twin a victory at the same time. Apparently, there was not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta remote chance of the fulfillment of the either\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprediction in the next few years. On the one hand, there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere a handful of the Muslims, who were being beaten and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttortured in Makkah, and even till eight years after this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprediction there appeared no chance of their victory and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdomination. On the contrary, the Romans were losing more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand more ground every next day. By 619 A. D. the whole of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEgypt had passed into Sassani hands and the Magian armies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad reached as far as Tripoli. In Asia Minor they beat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand pushed back the Romans to Bosporus, and in 617 A. D.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey captured Chalcedony (modern, Kadikoy) just opposite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConstantinople. The Emperor sent an envoy to Khusrau,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpraying that he was ready to have peace on any terms, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the replied, \"I shall not give protection to the emperor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuntil he is brought in chains before me and gives up\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobedience to his crucified god and adopts submission to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fire god.\" At last, the Emperor became so depressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby defeat that he decided to leave Constantinople and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshift to Carthage (modern, Tunis). In short, as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBritish historian Gibbon says, even seven to eight years\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter this prediction of the Qur'an, the conditions were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch that no one could even imagine that the Byzantine\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmpire would ever gain an upper hand over Persia, not to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspeak of gaining domination. No one could hope that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmpire, under the circumstances, would even survive.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen these verses of the Qur'an were sent down, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers of Makkah made great fun of them, and Ubayy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Khalaf bet Sayyiduna Abu Bakr ten camels that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRomans would not be victorious within three years. When\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet came to know of the bet, he said, \"The Qur'an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas used the words bid-i-sinin, and the word bid in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabic applies to a number up to ten. Therefore, make the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbet for ten years and increase the number of camels to a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thundred.\" So, Sayyiduna Abu Bakr spoke to Ubayy again and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbet a hundred camels for ten years.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn 622 A. D., when the Prophet migrated to Madinah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmperor Hercules set off quietly for Trabzon from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConstantinople via the Black Sea and started preparations\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto attack Persia from rear. For this he asked the Church\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor money, and Pope Sergius lent him the Church\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcollections on interest, in a bid to save Christianity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Zoroastrianism. Hercules started his counter attack\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin 623 A. D. from Armenia. Next year, in 624 A. D., he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentered Azerbaijan and destroyed Clorumia, the birthplace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Zoroaster, and ravaged the principal fire temple of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPersia. Great are the powers of Allah, this was the very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyear when the Muslims achieved a decisive victory at Badr\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the first time against the mushrikin. Thus, both the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpredictions made in Surah Rum were fulfilled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimultaneously within the stipulated period of ten years.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Byzantine forces continued to press the Persians hard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand in the decisive battle at Nineveh, (627 A.D.) they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdealt them the hardest blow. They captured the royal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresidence of Dast-Gerd, and then pressing forward,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treached right opposite to Ctesiphon, which was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcapital of Persia in those days. In 628 A. D., in an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinternal revolt, Khusrau Parvez was imprisoned and 18 of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this sons were executed in front of him and a few days\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlater, he himself died in prison. This was the year when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe peace treaty of Hudeybiyah was concluded, which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an has termed as \"the supreme victory\", and in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvery year Khusrau's son, Qubad II, gave up all the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccupied Roman territories, restored the True Cross and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade peace with Byzantine. In 628 A. D., the Emperor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself went to Jerusalem to instal the \" Cross\" in its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplace, and in the same year the Prophet entered Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the first time after the Hijrah to perform the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUmra-tul-Q'adah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, no one could have any doubt about the truth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the prophecy of the Qur'an, with the result that most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Arab polytheists accepted Islam. The heirs of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUbayy bin Khalaf lost their bet and had to give a hundred\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcamels to Sayyiduna Abu Bakr Siddiq. He took them before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet, who ordered that they be given away in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharity, because the bet had been made at a time when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgambling had not yet been forbidden by the Shari'ah; now\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit was forbidden. Therefore, the bet was allowed to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccepted from the belligerent disbelievers, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstruction given that it should be given away in charity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand should not be brought in personal use\".\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

The Prophet sent an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarmy of 150 warriors under the command of Sayyiduna Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSalmah (the first husband of Sayyidah Umme Salmah). This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarmy took Bani Asad by surprise and made them run in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpanic leaving all their possessions behind. After this,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBani An-Nadhir, a Jewish tribe, plotted to kill the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet but their plot was discovered in time. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet ordered them to leave Madinah within ten days and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twarned that anyone who remained behind after that would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe put to death.

Thus, the entire suburbs of the city,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich were inhabited by the Bani An-Nadhir, their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgardens, their fortresses and other properties fell into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe hands of Muslims.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, the Prophet received information that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribe of Bani Ghatfan was preparing for a war against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah.

H. 4, the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twent to the place of Badr with 1500 Muslims to fight\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst Abu Sufyan, who had challenged the Prophet and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims at the end of the Battle of Uhud, saying: \"We\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshall again meet you in combat at Badr next year.\" The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet accepted his challenge. From the other side, Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSufyan left Makkah with an army of 2,000 men, but did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave the courage to march beyond the town of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMarr-Az-Zahran, now known as Wadi Fatimah. The Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twaited for him at Badr for eight days; the Muslims during\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese days did profitable business with a trading\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaravan. This incident helped in restoring the image of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims that had been tarnished at Uhud. It also made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe whole of Arabia realize that the Qureysh alone could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno longer resist Muhammad (pbuh).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>The Battle</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe leaders of the Bani an-Nadhir, who had settled in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhayber after their banishment from Madinah, went around\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Qureysh, Ghatfan, Hudhail and many other tribes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trequesting them to gather all their forces and attack\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah jointly. Thus, in Shawwal, A. H. 5, a very large\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarmy of the Arab tribes marched against the small city of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah. From the north came the Jews of Bani an-Nadir\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Bani Qainuqah. From the east advanced the tribes of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGhatfan, Bani Sulaima, Fazarah, Murrah, Ashja, S'ad,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAsad, etc. and from the south the Qureysh along with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlarge force of their allies numbering from ten to twelve\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthousand warriors. Had it been a sudden attack, it would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been disastrous. Before the enemy could reach\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah, the Prophet got a trench dug on the northwest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Madinah in six days and took up defensive positions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith 3,000 warriors. Mount Salat was at their back, thick\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpalm tree gardens were on their south, therefore, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenemy could not attack from those sides. The same was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcase on the east side where there were lava rocks which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere impassable for a large army to cross. The same was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe case with the south- western side. The attack,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore, could be made only from the eastern and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twestern sides of the Uhud mountain, which the Prophet had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecured by digging a trench. The disbelievers were not at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall aware that they would have to encounter a trench\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toutside Madinah. This kind of a defensive stratagem was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunknown to the Arabs. Thus, they had to lay a long siege\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduring winter for which they had not been prepared.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe only alternative that remained for the disbelievers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas to incite the Jewish tribe of Bani Quraizah, who were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tliving in the southeastern part of the city to rebel. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet had a treaty with them that in case of an attack\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton Madinah they would defend the city along with them. As\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta result, the Prophet had made no defensive arrangement\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin that area and had even sent Muslim families to take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshelter in the forts situated on that side of the city.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe invaders perceived this weakness in the defenses of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslim army. They sent a Jewish leader of the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn-Nadhir to the Bani Quraizah and induced them to break\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe treaty and join the war against the Muslims. In the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeginning, they refused saying that they had a treaty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith Muhammad (pbuh) who had faithfully abided by it and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven them no cause for complaint. But, when Ibn Akhtab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid to them, \"Look, I have summoned a united force of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentire Arabia against him. This is a perfect opportunity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto get rid of him, if you lose it, you will never have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother opportunity,\" thus, the anti-Islamic mind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevailed over every moral consideration and they agreed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto violate the treaty.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the Prophet received this news, he at once asked the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchiefs of the Ansar, to go and find out the truth. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadvised them that if they found Bani Quraizah still loyal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the treaty, they should return and say so openly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the Muslim army; however, if they found that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere bent upon treachery they should only inform him so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the common Muslims would not panic. When inquired,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBani Quraizah openly told the chiefs: \"There is no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagreement and no treaty between us and Muhammad.\" At this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey returned and submitted their report to the Prophet.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter ascertaining verification, the Prophet, at that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcritical moment, initiated peace negotiations with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twarrior tribe of Bani Ghatfan offering them one third of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fruit harvest of Madinah in lieu of their withdrawal.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut when he asked S'ad bin Ubadah and S'ad bin Muadh,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchief of the Ansar for their opinion about the conditions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof peace, they asked, \"O Rasool of Allah: Is it your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonal wish that we should agree on these conditions,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor is it Allah's Command that we have no option but to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept it, or, are you proposing this only to save us\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the enemy?\" The Prophet replied, \"I am proposing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis only to save you: I see that the whole of Arabia has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformed a united front against you. I want to divide the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenemy.\" At this, the two chiefs protested saying, \"Your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thonor, if you want to conclude this pact for our sake,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplease forget it. These tribes could not subdue us under\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribute when we were polytheists. Now that we have the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thonor of believing in Allah and His Rasool, will they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake us sink to this depth of ignominy? Let the sword be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe arbiter till Allah passes His judgement between them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand us.\" With these words, they tore up the draft for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreaty which had not yet been signed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the meantime Nu'aim bin Mas'ud, a member of the Ashja\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbranch of the Ghatfan tribe, became a Muslim and came\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the Prophet and submitted, \"No one as yet knows\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat I have embraced Islam: You can take from me whatever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tservice you please.\" The Holy Prophet replied: \"Go and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsow the seeds of discord among the enemy.\" So, first of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall, Nu'aim went to the tribe of Quraizah with whom he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas on friendly terms, and said to them, \"The Qureysh and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Ghatfan can become wearied of the siege and go back,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand they will lose nothing, but you have to live here\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the Muslims. Just consider what your position will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe if the matter turns out that way. Therefore, I would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadvise you not to join the enemy until the outsiders\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould send some of their prominent men as hostages to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou.\" This had the desired effect upon the Bani Quraizah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand they decided to demand hostages from the united front\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the tribes. Then he went to the chiefs of the Qureysh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Ghatfan and said to them, \"The Bani Quraizah seem\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto be slack and irresolute. They may demand some men as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thostages from you and then hand them over to Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be Allah's peace) to settle their affair with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim. Therefore, be very firm and cautious in your dealing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith them.\" This made the leaders of the united front\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuspicious of Bani Quraizah, and they sent them a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage, saying, \"We are tired of the long siege; let\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere be a decisive battle; let us, therefore, make a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeneral assault simultaneously from both the sides.\" The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBani Quraizah sent back the word, saying, \"We cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafford to join the war unless you hand over some of your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprominent men to us as hostages.\" The leaders of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunited front became convinced that what Nu'aim had said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas true. They refused to send hostages. And the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraizah, on the other side, also felt that Nu'aim had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven them the correct counsel. Thus, the strategy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworked: it divided the enemy against itself.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Victory granted by Allah without fight</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe siege was prolonged for more than 25 days. It was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twinter, and supply of food and water and forage was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecoming more and more scarce. Division in the camp was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso a great strain on the state of morale of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbesiegers. Then, suddenly one night, a severe windstorm\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccompanied by thunder and lightning hit the camp. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadded to the cold and darkness. The wind blew over the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttents and put the enemy in disarray. They could not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithstand this severe blow of nature. They left the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbattleground during the night and returned to their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thomes. When the Muslims awoke in the morning, there was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot a single enemy soldier to be seen on the battlefield.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Prophet, finding the battlefield completely empty,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: \"The Qureysh will never be able to attack you after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis: now you will take the offensive.\" This was a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorrect assessment of the situation. Not only the Qureysh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut the united front of all the enemy tribes had made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir final assault against Islam and had failed. Now\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey could no longer dare invade Madinah; now the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere on the offensive.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Raid on Bani Quraizah</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the Prophet returned from the Trench, angel Gabriel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame to him in the early afternoon with the Divine\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCommand; the Muslims should not lay aside their arms\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout dealing with the Bani Quraizah. On receipt of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Command, the Prophet made the announcement:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Everyone who is steadfast in obedience should not offer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this 'Asr Prayer till he reaches the locality of the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraizah.\" Immediately after this, he despatched\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSayyiduna Ali with a contingent of soldiers as vanguard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttowards the Quraizah. When they reached there, the Jews\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclimbed on to their roof tops and started hurling abuses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the Prophet and the Muslims, but their invectives\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould not save them from the consequences of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreachery. They had committed a breach of the treaty at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe most critical moment of the war, joined hands with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe invaders and endangered the entire population of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah. When they saw the contingent of Sayyiduna Ali,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey thought that they had come only to overawe them. But\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen the whole Muslim army arrived under the command of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet himself and laid siege to their quarters,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were very frightened. They could not stand the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseverity of the siege for more than two or three weeks.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt last, they surrendered themselves to the Prophet on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe condition that they would accept whatever decision\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSayyiduna S'ad bin Muadh, the chief of the Aus, would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgive. They had accepted Sayyiduna S'ad as their judge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause, in the pre-Islamic days, the Aus and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraizah had been confederates. They hoped that in view\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof their past ties, the people of the Aus also wished\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Sayyiduna S'ad would treat their previous allies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleniently. But Sayyiduna S'ad had just experienced and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseen how the two Jewish tribes, who had been allowed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleave Madinah previously, had instigated the other tribes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tliving around Madinah and summoned a united front of ten\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto twelve thousand men against the Muslims. He was also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taware how treacherously this Jewish tribe had behaved on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe occasion when the city was under attack threatening\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe safety of its entire population. He, therefore,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecreed that all the male members of the Quraizah should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe put to death, their women and children taken prisoners\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand their properties distributed among the Muslims. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsentence was carried out. When the Muslims entered their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrongholds they found that these treacherous tribe had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcollected 1,500 swords, 300 coats of mail, 2,000 spears\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand 1,500 shields in order to join the war. If Allah had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot helped the Muslims, all this military equipment would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been used to attack Madinah from the rear at a time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen the polytheists were making preparations for a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeneral assault on the Muslims after crossing the Trench.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this disclosure, there remained no doubt that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecision of Sayyiduna S'ad concerning those people, was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe right decision.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Social Reforms</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this Surah, the Islamic laws pertaining to marriage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand divorce were complemented; the law of inheritance was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintroduced, drinking and gambling were prohibited, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnew laws and regulations concerning economic and social\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife were enacted. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Status of adopted children</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe question concerning adoption was also addressed in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah. An adopted son was regarded as their own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffspring by the Arabs at that time: he was entitled to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinheritance; he was treated like a real son and real\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrother by the adopted mother and the adopted sister; he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould not marry the daughter of his adopted father or his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twidow after his father's death. And the same was the case\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif the adopted son died or divorced a wife. The adopted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfather regarded the woman as his real daughter-in-law.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis custom clashed in every detail with the laws of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarriage and divorce and inheritance enjoined by Allah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs Al-Baqarah and An-Nisa'. It made a person who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould get no share in inheritance, entitled to it at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpense of those who were really entitled to it. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprohibited marriage between the men and the women who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould enter into the contract of marriage. And, above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall, it helped spread the immoralities which the Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLaw wanted to eradicate. For a real mother, a real sister\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand a real daughter cannot be like the adopted mother,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe adopted sister and the adopted daughter. When\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tartificial relations endowed with customary sanctity are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallowed to mix freely like the blood relations, evil is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toften the result. That is why the Islamic law of marriage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand divorce, the law of inheritance and the law\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprohibiting adultery require that the concept and custom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof regarding the adopted son as a real son should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teradicated. This concept however could not be uprooted by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmerely passing a legal order because centuries old\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprejudices and superstitions could not be changed by mere\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tword of mouth. Therefore, a little before the Battle of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Trench, the Prophet was asked by Allah to marry\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSayyidah Zainab, the divorced wife of his adopted son,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZaid bin Harithah (may Allah be pleased with him). The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet acted on this Commandment during the siege\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Bani Quraizah. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Defamatory remarks by the Jews, Pagans and Hypocrites</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs soon as the marriage was contracted, there arose a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstorm of propaganda against the Prophet. The polytheists,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe hypocrites and the Jews all were burning with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjealousy at the Prophet's triumphs which followed one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the other. The way they had been humbled within two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyears after Uhud, in the Battle of the Trench, and in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffair of the Quraizah, had made them sore at heart. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad also lost hope that they could ever subdue him on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbattlefield. Therefore, they seized the question of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarriage as a godsend blessing for them and thought they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould put an end to his moral superiority, which was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecret of his power and success. Therefore, stories were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcocted that Muhammad, God forbid, had fallen in love\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith his daughter-in-law, and when his son had come to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknow of this, he divorced his wife, and the father\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarried his daughter-in-law. The propaganda, however, was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsurd on the face of it. Sayyidah Zainab was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's first cousin. He had known her from childhood\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto youth. So, there could be no question of his falling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin love with her at first sight. Then he himself had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarranged her marriage with Sayyiduna Zaid under his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonal influence, although her whole family had opposed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit. They did not like that a daughter of the noble\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh should be given in marriage to a freed slave.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSayyidah Zainab herself was not happy at this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarrangement. But everyone had to submit to the Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommand. The marriage was solemnized and a precedent was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tset in Arabia that Islam had raised a freed slave to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatus of the Qureyshite nobility. If the Prophet had in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treality any desire for Sayyidah Zainab, there was no need\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin marrying her to Sayyiduna Zaid. He himself could have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarried her.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>The Laws of Hijab </div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe fact that the tales invented by the enemies of Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso became topics of conversation among the Muslims, was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta clear sign that the element of sensuality in society\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad crossed all limits. If this malady had not existed,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit was not possible that people would have paid any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattention whatever to such absurd stories about such a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trighteous and pure person like the Prophet.

On the one hand, there were the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphets David and Solomon, who had been blessed by Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith great powers and such grandeur and glory as had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgranted to hardly any one of the like before them. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspite of this, they were not proud and arrogant, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremained grateful servants of their Rabb. On the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thand, were the people of Saba, who, when blessed by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, became proud, and were consequently so thoroughly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestroyed and dispersed that they were remembered only in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmyths and legends. With these precedents in view, you may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsee and judge for yourselves as to which type of life is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetter: the one which is built on belief in Tawhid, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter and the attitude of gratefulness to Allah, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe one which is based on disbelief, shirk, denial of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter and the worship of materialism.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYa-Sin has been called the throbbing heart of the Qur'an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause it presents the message of the Qur'an in a most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforceful manner which breaks the inertness and stirs the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspirit of man to action.

In view of this, it would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdesirable that, along with the recitation of the Surah Ya\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSin, its translation is also read for the benefit of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson who does not know Arabic so that the purpose of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe admonition is duly fulfilled.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

After describing the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstories of nine Prophets, one after the other, Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temphasized the point that His law of justice is impartial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand that only the people of right attitude are acceptable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Him, that He calls to account and punishes every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrongdoer whoever he be, and likes only those people who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo not persist in wrongdoing but repent as soon as they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare informed about it, and pass their life in the world\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkeeping in mind their accountability to Allah in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, mention has been made of the story of Adam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Iblees (Shaitan), which is meant to tell the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelieving Qureysh that the same arrogance and vanity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich was preventing them from bowing before Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(pbuh) had prevented Iblees also from bowing before Adam.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIblees felt jealous of the high rank that Allah had given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Adam and was cursed when he disobeyed His Command.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLikewise, \"You, O people of Qureysh, are feeling jealous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the high rank that Allah has bestowed on Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(pbuh) and are not prepared to obey him whereas Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappointed him as His Rasool.

What he says is not new or strange, nor anything\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnovel, which is being presented for the first time in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory: that Revelation should come down to a man from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod and he should be given instructions for the guidance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof mankind. Allah has been sending similar Revelations\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith similar instructions to former Prophets. It is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurprising that the Owner of the Universe should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacknowledged as the Deity and Ruler, but what is strange\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis that one should accept another as divine and deity in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspite of being His subject and slave. You are being angry\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith him who is presenting Tawhid before you, where as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe shirk that you are practicing with regard to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMaster of the Universe is such a grave crime as may cause\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe heavens to break asunder. The angels are amazed at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis boldness of yours and fear that the wrath of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmight descend on you any moment.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, the people have been told that a person's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing appointed to the Prophethood and his presenting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself as a Prophet does not mean that he has been made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaster of people's destinies and he has come to the world\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith that very claim. Allah has kept destiny in His own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thands. The Prophet has come only to arouse the heedless\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand guide the strayed ones to the Right Path. To call to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccount those who do not listen to him and to punish or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot to punish them is Allah's own responsibility and not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta part of the Prophet's work. Therefore, they should take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit out of their head that the Prophet has come with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclaim similar to those that are made by their so called\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligious guides and saints to the effect that he who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould not listen to them, or would behave insolently\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttowards them, would be burnt to death: In this very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconnection, the people have also been told that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet has not come to condemn them but he is their well\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twisher; he is warning them that the way they are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowing will only lead to their own destruction.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen an answer has been given to the question: Why didn't\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah make all human beings righteous by birth, and why\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid He allow the difference of viewpoint owing to which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople start following each other in thought and action?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, it has been explained that the way of life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresented by the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is that Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAlmighty is the Creator, Master and real Patron of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUniverse and Man. He Alone is Man's Ruler, He Alone has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe right to give Man Faith (Din) and Law (system of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelief and practice) and judge the disputes of man and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttell what is Truth and what is falsehood. No other being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas any right whatever to be man's lawgiver. In other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords, like natural sovereignty, the sovereignty with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregard to lawmaking also is vested only in Allah. No man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor creature, apart from Allah, can be the bearer of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsovereignty. And if a person does not recognize and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept this Divine rule of Allah, it is merely futile for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim to recognize the natural sovereignty of Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn this very basis has Allah ordained a Din (True\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tReligion) for Man from the very beginning. It was one and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same Religion that was vouchsafed in every age to all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophets. No Prophet ever founded any separate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligion of his own. The same one Religion has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoined by Allah for all Mankind since the beginning of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreation, and all the Prophets have been following it and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinviting others to follow it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Religion and Creed was not sent so that man may rest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontentedly only with believing in it, but it was sent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the purpose and intention that it alone should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintroduced, established and enforced in the world, and no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman made religion should prevail in Allah's earth apart\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom His Religion. The Prophets had not been appointed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly to preach this Religion, but to establish it in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis same religion is the original religion of mankind,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut after the death of the Prophets, selfish people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreated new creeds by creating schisms for vested\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterests due to self-conceit, vanity and ostentation.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAll the different religions and creeds found in the world\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoday have resulted from corruption of the original\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDivine Truth.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow, the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace,)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been assigned to present before the people the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand original Religion in place of the various practices\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand artificial creeds and man made religion, and may try\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto establish the same. Of this, if instead of being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrateful, you feel angry and come out to fight him, it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour folly; the Prophet will not abandon his mission only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause of your foolishness. He has been enjoined to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadhere to his faith at all costs and to carry out the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmission to which he has been appointed. Therefore, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople should not cherish any false hope that in order to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplease you he would cater to the same whims and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuperstitions of ignorance which has corrupted Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tReligion before.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat the Prophet was wholly unaware of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconcept of the \"Book\" or the True Faith during\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe first forty years of his life and then his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsudden appearance before the people with those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo things, is a manifest proof of his being a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHis presenting his own teaching as the teaching\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof God does not mean that he claims to have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tspoken to God, face to face, but God has conveyed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto him this Guidance, as in the case of all other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphets, in three ways: He speaks to His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphets either through Revelation, or from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbehind a veil, or He sends an angel with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage. This thing was clarified so that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\topponents of the message did not have an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\topportunity of accusing the Prophet of claiming\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto have spoken to God, face to face, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlovers of the truth should know by what methods\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah gave instruction to the man whom He had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tappointed to the mission of Prophethood.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

They believed that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe angels were goddesses; they had carved their images\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas females; they adorned them with female dresses and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tornaments, and called them daughters of Allah: they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworshipped them and invoked them for the fulfillment of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir needs. They had no answer to the question as to how\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo they knew that the angels were female?

The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh and the other tribes had continued their boycott\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Bani Hashim and the Muslims for three years and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet and the people of his family and companions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlay besieged in Shi'b Abi Talib. The Qureysh had blocked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tup this area from all sides so that no supplies of any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkind could reach the besieged people. Only during the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj season were they allowed to come out and purchase\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome articles of necessity. But even at that time,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhenever Abu Lahab noticed any of them approaching the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarketplace or a trading caravan he would call out to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmerchants exhorting them to announce forbidding rates of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir articles for them, and would pledge that he himself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould buy those articles so that they did not suffer any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tloss. This boycott which continued uninterrupted for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree years had broken the backs of the Muslims and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBani Hashim; so much so that at times, they were forced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto eat grass and the leaves of trees. At last, when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsiege was lifted, Abu Talib, the Prophet's uncle, who had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen shielding him for ten long years, died. Hardly a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmonth later his wife, Sayyidah Khadijah, who had been a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsource of peace and consolation for him ever since the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeginning of the call, also passed away. Because of these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttragic incidents which closely followed each other, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet used to refer to this year as the year of sorrow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand grief.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter the death of Sayyidah Khadijah and Abu Talib, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers of Makkah became even bolder in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcampaign against the Prophet. The Prophet decided to go\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Ta'if and approach the chiefs and nobles of the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThaqif. But, not only did they refused to listen to him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey asked him to leave. When he was leaving, the chiefs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Thaqif sent their slaves and scoundrels after him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey screamed at him, abused him and pelted him with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstones for most of the way from both sides of the road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuntil he broke down, wounded bleeding. The degree of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinjuries were such that his shoes were filled with blood.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWearied and exhausted, he took shelter in the shade of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twall of a garden outside Ta'if, and prayed:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"O Allah, to You I complain of my weakness, little\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresource, and lowliness before men. O Most Merciful, You\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare the Rabb of the weak, and You are my Rabb. To whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill You confide me? To the one who will misuse me, or to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan enemy to whom You have given power over me? If You are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot angry with me, I care not. Your favor is wide for me.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI take refuge in the light of Your countenance by which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe darkness is illuminated, and the things of this world\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the next are rightly ordered, lest Your anger\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescends upon me or Your wrath lights upon me. It is for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYou to be satisfied until You are well pleased. There is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno power and no might except Yours.\" (Ibn Hisham: A.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGuillaume's Translation, p. 193).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGrief stricken and heart broken when he returned near\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQarn al-Manazil, he felt as though the sky was overcast\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby clouds. He looked up and saw Gabriel in front of him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho called out: \"Allah has heard the way your people have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponded. He has, therefore, sent this angel in-charge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the mountains. You may command him as you please.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen the angel of the mountains greeted him and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubmitted:\" If you like, I will overturn the mountains\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom either side upon these people.\" The Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied : \"No, but I expect that Allah will create from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir seed those who will worship none but Allah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOne.\" (Bukhari, Dhikr al Mala'ikah; Muslim: Kitab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Maghazi; Nasa'i :Al-Bauth). One night when he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treciting the Qur'an in Prayer, a group of the jinn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappened to pass by and listened to the Qur'an, believed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin it, and returned to their people to preach Islam.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThus, Allah gave His Prophet the good news that, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople were running away from his invitation, there were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmany jinn, who had become believers, and they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspreading the message among their own kind. Anyone who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkeeps this background in view, and studies this Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill have no doubt left in his mind that this is not at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall the composition of Muhammad (pbuh), but \"a Revelation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the All Mighty, All Wise Allah.\" For nowhere in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah, from the beginning to end, does one find even a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttinge of the human feelings and reactions, which are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnaturally produced in a man who is passing through such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thard conditions. Considering the Prophet's prayer that is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcited above which contains his own language, one can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclearly note that its every word is saturated with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfeelings that he had at the time.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

In A.H. 6, the Prophet saw a dream\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he went to Makkah with his Companions and had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformed Umrah. Obviously, the Prophet's dream could not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe a mere dream and fiction for it is a kind of Divine\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinspiration as Allah Himself has confirmed in verse 27.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhere He said that He Himself had shown that dream to His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRasool. It was not merely a dream but a Divine\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinspiration which the Prophet had to obey and follow.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, the Prophet informed his Companions of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdream and began to make preparations for the journey.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmong the tribes living in the suburbs he had the public\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tannouncement made that he was proceeding for Umrah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people could join him. About 1,400 of the Companions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjoined him on this highly dangerous journey.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>History</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey set off from Madinah in the beginning of Dhil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQ'adah, A. H. 6. At Dhul Hulaifah they put on pilgrims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trobes with the intention of performing Umrah, took 70\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcamels with collars round their necks indicating that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were sacrificial animals; and kept only a sword each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin sheaths, which the pilgrims to the Ka'bah were allowed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto carry according to the recognized custom of Arabia.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey carried no other weapons. Thus, the caravan set out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the Ka'bah, the House of Allah, in Makkah, chanting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe prescribed slogan of \"Labbaik, Allahumma labbaik.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Holy Prophet despatched a man of the Bani Ka'b as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecret agent so that he may keep him informed of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintentions and movements of the Qureysh. When the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treached Usfan, he brought the news that the Qureysh had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treached Dhi Tuwa with full preparations and they had sent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhalid bin Walid with two hundred cavalry towards\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKura'al-Ghamim to intercept him. The Qureysh wanted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomehow to provoke the Prophet's companions to fight so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they could tell the Arabs that the Muslims had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactually come to fight and had put on the pilgrim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgarments only to deceive others. Upon receiving this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinformation, the Prophet immediately changed his route\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand following a very rugged, rocky track, reached\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHudeybiyah, which was situated right on the boundary of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sacred Makkan territory. Here, he was visited by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBudail bin Warqa, the chief of the Bani Khuza'ah along\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith some men of his tribe. They asked what he had come\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor. The Prophet replied that he and his companions had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcome only for pilgrimage to the House of Allah. The men\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Khuza'ah went and told this to the Qureysh chiefs and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcounselled them not to interfere with the pilgrims.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Qureysh sent Urwah bin Mas'ud Thaqafi who held\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlengthy negotiations with the Prophet and persuaded him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto give up his intention to enter Makkah. But the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgave him the same reply that he had given to the chief of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Khuza'ah. Urwah went back and said to the Qureysh: \"I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been to the courts of the Caesar, the Khosroes and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Negus but, by God, never have I seen any people so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdevoted to a king as are the companions of Muhammad. If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad makes his ablutions they would not let the water\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfall thereof on the ground but would rub it on their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbodies and clothes. Now you may decide as to what you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould do.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Prophet sent Sayyiduna Uthman (may Allah be pleased\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith him) as his envoy to Makkah with the message that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey had come only for pilgrimage and had brought their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrificial camels along, and that they would go back\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter performing the rite of pilgrimage and offering\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrifice. But the Qureysh did not agree and withheld\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSayyiduna Uthman in the city. In the meantime a rumor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspread that Sayyiduna Uthman had been killed. Since he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid not return in time, the Muslims took the rumor to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrue. Now they could show no more forbearance because\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir ambassador was put to death. The Muslims had no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talternative but to prepare for war. Therefore, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet summoned all his companions and took a solemn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpledge from them that they would fight to death. It was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot an ordinary undertaking. The Muslims were only 1400\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand had come without any weapons. They were camping at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe boundary of Makkah, which was 250 miles away from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir own city. The enemy could attack them in full\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrength and could surround them with its allies from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadjoining tribes as well. In spite of this, none from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaravan except, one man, failed to give his pledge to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfight to death, and there could be no greater proof of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir dedication and sincerity to the cause of Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis pledge is well known in the history of Islam and is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcalled the Bait-e-Ridwan.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Terms of Treaty</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater on they came to know that the news about Sayyiduna\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUthman was false. He return with a deputation under the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleadership of Suhail bin 'Amr from the Qureysh to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnegotiate peace with the Prophet. The Qureysh insisted no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore in disallowing the Prophet and his companions to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenter Makkah. However, in order to save face, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinsisted only that they should return that year and come\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tback the following year to perform Umrah.

But, if a companion of Muhammad were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto defect to the Qureysh, there will be no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trequirement for his return.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEvery Arab tribe would have the option to join\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\teither side as its ally and enter the treaty.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad and his men would go back that year and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcould come the following year for Umrah and stay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin Makkah for three days, provided that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbrought only one sheathed sword each, and no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tother weapon of war. In those three days, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkans would vacate the city for them (so that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthere was no chance of conflict), but they would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnot be allowed to take along any Makkan on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treturn.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Reaction to the Treaty</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe disbelieving Qureysh looked at this treaty as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvictory and the Muslims were upset considering this as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thumiliation in accepting these conditions. When the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdocument was finished, the Prophet asked his companions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto slaughter their sacrificial animals at that very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplace, shave their heads and put off the pilgrim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgarments, but no one moved. The Prophet repeated the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torder thrice but the companions were so much in shock,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdepression and dejection that they did not comply. During\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this entire period of Risalat (Prophethood) on no occasion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad it ever happened that he (Prophet Muhammad) command\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this companions to do something and they did not hasten to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomply. This caused him a great shock. Returning to his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttent he expressed his grief to his wife, Sayyidah Umme\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSalamah. She said, \"You shall quietly go and slaughter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour own camel and call the barber to have your head\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshaved. After that, the people will automatically do what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou did and will understand that whatever decision you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave taken will not be changed.\" That is what precisely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappened. The people slaughtered their animals, shaved\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir heads or cut their hair short and put off the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpilgrim garb. Nevertheless their hearts were still\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafflicted with grief.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater, when this caravan was returning to Madinah, this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah was revealed, telling the Muslims that the treaty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they were regarding as their defeat was in fact a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreat victory. The Holy Prophet summoned the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttogether and said: \"Today such a thing has been sent down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto me which is more valuable to me than the world and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat it contains.\" Then recited this Surah. The believers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecame satisfied when they heard this Divine Revelation.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe advantages of this treaty began to appear one after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe other which proved that this peace treaty indeed was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta great victory. Salient features of this treaty were as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollows:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis treaty acknowledged the existence of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic State in Arabia. Prior to this, the Arabs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconsidered the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions as rebels and outlaws. By concluding\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthis agreement, the Qureysh themselves recognized\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet's sovereignty over the territories of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Islamic State and opened the way for the Arab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttribes to enter into treaties of alliance with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\teither one of the powers.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Qureysh acknowledged the Muslim's right of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpilgrimage to the House of Allah. They admitted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Islam was not an antireligious creed, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlike the other Arabs, its followers also had the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tright to perform the rites of Hajj and Umrah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis diminished the hatred in the Arab's hearts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcaused by the propaganda made by the Qureysh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst Islam and its followers.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe no-war pact for ten years provided full peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Muslims, and they were able to preach\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam in such a way that within two years after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHudeybiyah, the number of the people who embraced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam far exceeded those of the past 19 years. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twas due to this treaty that two years later, when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin consequence of the Qureysh's violating the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttreaty, the Prophet invaded Makkah. He was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccompanied by an army 10,000 strong, whereas on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe occasion of Hudeybiyah, only 1,400 men had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tjoined him in the march.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe suspension of hostilities provided the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet an opportunity to establish and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tstrengthen Islamic rule and turn the Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsociety into a full-fledged civilization and way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof life through practicing the Islamic law. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tis that great blessing about which Allah says in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tverse 3 of Surah Al-Ma'idah: \"Today I have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tperfected your Religion for you and completed My\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tblessing on you and approved Islam as the Way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLife for you.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe balance of power in Arabia changed within two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tyears after this treaty was signed and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tstrength of the Qureysh and other pagan tribes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdiminished and the domination of Islam became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcertain. One provision of this treaty which had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdisturbed the Muslims most was the condition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tabout the fugitives from Makkah and Madinah, that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe former would be returned and the latter would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnot be returned. But not much longer afterwards\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthis condition also proved to be disadvantageous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the Qureysh. The experience revealed what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfar-reaching consequences the Prophet had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tforeseen and why he accepted it. A few days after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe treaty a Muslim of Makkah, Abu Basir, escaped\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the Qureysh and reached Madinah. The Qureysh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdemanded him back and the Prophet returned him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir men who had been sent from Makkah to arrest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thim. But while on the way to Makkah, he again\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfled and sat on the road by the Red Sea shore,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhich the trade caravans of the Qureysh took to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSyria. After that, every Muslim who succeeded in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tescaping from the Qureysh would go and join Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBasir instead of going to Madinah, until 70 men\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgathered there. They would attack any Qureysh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcaravan that passed that way cutting it to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpieces. At last, the Qureysh themselves begged\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet to call those men to Madinah, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition relating to the return of the fugitives\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\titself became null and void.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBeing assured of peace from the south, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims overpowered all the opposing forces in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe north and central Arabia easily. Just three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmonths after Hudeybiyah, Khayber, the major\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tstronghold of the Jews, was conquered and after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tit the Jewish settlements of Fadak, Wad-il-Qura,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTaima and Tabuk also fell to the Muslims one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the other. Then, all other tribes of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcentral Arabia which were bound in alliance with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Jews and Qureysh, came under the sway of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

A\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twoman named Umme Hisham bin Harithah, who was a neighbor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Prophet, said that she was able to commit Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQaf to memory only because she often heard it from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet in the Friday sermons. According to some other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditions, he often recited during Fajr Prayer. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmakes it abundantly clear that this was an important\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah in the sight of the Prophet. That is why he made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsure that its contents reached as many people as possible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover and over again.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe reason for its importance can be easily understood by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcareful study of the Surah. The theme of the entire Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the Hereafter. When the Prophet started preaching his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage in Makkah, what surprised the people most was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnews that people would be resurrected after death, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey would have to render an account of their deeds. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah, arguments are given for the possibility and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurrence of the hereafter in a brief way, in short\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsentences, and the people are warned, as if to say:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Whether you express wonder and surprise, or you regard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit as something remote from reason, or deny it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taltogether, in any case it cannot change the truth. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsolute, unalterable truth is that Allah knows the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhereabouts of each and every particle of your body that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas decomposed in the earth, and knows where and in what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate it is. Allah's one signal is enough to make all the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecomposed particles gather together again and to make\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou rise up once again as you had been created in your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearthly life. Likewise, the idea that you have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreated alone in the world and that you are not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanswerable to anyone, is no more than a misunderstanding.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe fact is that not only is Allah Himself directly aware\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof each act and word of yours; even of the ideas that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpass in your mind, but His angels also are attached to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teach one of you and are recording whatever you do and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tutter. On the Day of Judgment you will come out of your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgraves at one call just as the young shoots of vegetable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsprout up from the earth after the first rain shower.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, this heedlessness which obstructs your vision will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe removed and you will see with your own eyes all that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou are denying today. At that time, you will realize\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat you have not been created to be irresponsible in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis world but accountable for all your deeds and you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill be awarded paradise as a reward or hell as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunishment. The paradise and the hell which you regard as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timpossible and imaginary things will, at that time,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome visible realities. In consequence of your enmity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand opposition to the truth, you will be cast into the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame hell which you deny today and those who fear Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand adopt the path of righteousness, will be admitted to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same paradise at the mention of which you express\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twonder and surprise.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

It would mean that man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould remain involved in grave misunderstanding, his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole life passing in heedless, error, and after death,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould suddenly meet with a situation for which he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade no preparation at all.

The discourse starts by saying: \"Muhammad is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneither deluded nor gone astray, as you are telling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers in your propaganda against him, nor has he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfabricated this teaching of Islam and its message, as you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseem to think he has. In fact, whatever he is presenting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis nothing but Revelation which is sent down to him. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverities that he presents before you, are not the product\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his own surmise and speculation but realities of which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the himself is an eye witness. He has himself seen the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAngel through whom this knowledge is conveyed to him.

You\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tregard the angels as the daughters of Allah. You\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthink that these deities of yours can influence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah in your favor, whereas the fact is that all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe angels together, who are stationed closest to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, cannot influence Him even in their own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfavor. None of beliefs that you have adopted is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbased on knowledge and reason, but are wishes and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdesires for the sake of which you have taken some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhims as realities.

These\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tare the same fundamental truths which the former\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphets of Allah have always been presenting in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir respective ages.

They have not left\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany writings of their own in the form of a book or a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttablet which might shed light on their past, nor have the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJewish historians and writers of the non-Arab world made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany mention of them. The reason being that after their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettlement in the Arabian peninsula, they had detached\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves from the main body of the Jewish nation, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Jews of the world did not count them among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves. They had given up the Hebrew culture and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlanguage, even the names, and adopted Arabism instead. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttablets that have been unearthed in archaeological\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresearch in the Hijaz, no trace of the Jews is found\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the first century of the Christian era, except for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta few Jewish names. Therefore, the history of the Arabian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJews is based mostly on the verbal traditions prevalent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the Arabs most of which bad been spread by the Jews\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Jews of the Hijaz claimed that they had come to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettle in Arabia during the last stage of the life of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Moses (peace be upon him). They said that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Moses had despatched an army to expel the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmalekites from the land of Yathrib and had commanded it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot to spare even a single soul of that tribe. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIsraelite army carried out the Prophet's command, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspared the life of a handsome prince of the Amalekite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tking and returned with him to Palestine. By that time the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Moses had passed away. His successors took great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texception to what the army had done, for by sparing the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife of an Amalekite, it had clearly disobeyed the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet and violated the Mosaic law. Consequently, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcluded the army from their community, and it had to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn to Yathrib and settle there forever. (Kitab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Aghani, vol. xix, p. 94). Thus the Jews claimed that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey had been living in Yathrib since about 1200 B.C.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut, this had in fact no historical basis. The Jews\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprobably had invented this story in order to overawe the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabs into believing that they were of noble lineage and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe original inhabitants of the land.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe second Jewish immigration, according to the Jews,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttook, place in 587 BC. when Nebuchadnezzer, the King of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBabylon, destroyed Jerusalem and dispersed the Jews\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthroughout the world. The Arab Jews said that several of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir tribes at that time had come to settle in Wadi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Qura, Taima, and Yathrib. (Al-Baladhuri, Futuh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Buldan). But this too has no historical basis. By this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey also might have wanted to prove that they were the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toriginal settlers of the area.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs a matter of fact, in A. D. 70 the Romans massacred the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJews in Palestine, and then in A. D. 132 expelled them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom that land, many of the Jewish tribes fled to find an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasylum in the Hijaz, a territory that was contiguous to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPalestine in the south. There they settled wherever they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfound water springs and greenery, and then by intrigue\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand through money lending business gradually occupied the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfertile lands. Ailah, Maqna, Tabuk, Taima, Wadi al Qura,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFadak and Khayber came under their control in that very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod, and Bani Quraizah, Bani al-Nadhir, Bani Bahdal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Bani Qainuqa also came in the same period and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccupied Yathrib.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmong the tribes that settled in Yathrib the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn-Nadhir and the Bani Quraizah were more prominent for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey belonged to the Cohen or priest class. They were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlooked upon as of noble descent and enjoyed religious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleadership among their co-religionists. When they came to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettle in Madinah there were some other tribes already\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tliving there. They subdued them and became the owners of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis green and fertile land. About three centuries later,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin A. D. 450 or 451, the great flood of Yaman occurred\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich has been mentioned in vv. 16-17 of Surah Saba. As a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresult of this, different tribes of the people of Saba\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere compelled to leave Yaman and disperse to different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparts of Arabia. Thus, the Bani Ghassan went to settle in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSyria, Bani Lakhm in Hirah (Iraq), Bani Khuza'ah between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJeddah and Makkah and the Aus and the Khazraj went to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettle in Yathrib. As Yathrib was under Jewish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdomination, they at first did not allow the Aus and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhazraj to gain a footing and the two Arab tribes had to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettle on lands that had not yet been brought under\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcultivation. There they could hardly produce enough to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenable them to survive. At last, one of their chiefs went\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Syria to ask for the assistance of their Ghassanide\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrothers; he brought an army from there and broke the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpower of the Jews. Thus, the Aus and the Khazraj were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\table to gain complete dominance over Yathrib, with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresult that two of the major Jewish tribes, Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan-Nadhir and Bani Quraiza were forced to take quarters\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toutside the city. Since the third tribe, Bani Qainuqa,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas not on friendly terms with the other two tribes, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstayed inside the city as usual, but had to seek\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprotection of the Khazraj tribe. As a counter measure to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis, Bani an-Nadhir and Bani Quraizah took protection of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Aus tribe so that they could live in peace in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuburbs of Yathrib.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBefore the Prophet's arrival at Madinah and until his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temigration, the following were the main features of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJews position in Hijaz in general and in Yathrib in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticular\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the matter of language, dress, civilization\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand way of life they had completely adopted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArabism, even their names had become Arabian. Of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe 12 Jewish tribes that had settled in Hijaz,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnone except the Bani Zaura retained its Hebrew\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tname.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBecause of this Arabism, the western orientalists\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thave been misled into thinking that perhaps they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twere not really Israelites but Arabs who had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tembraced Judaism, or that at least a majority of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthem were Arab Jews. But there is no historical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tproof to show that the Jews ever engaged in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpropagation of Judaism in Hijaz, or that their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trabbis invited the Arabs to embrace Judaism like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Christian priests and missionaries. On the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcontrary, they prided themselves upon their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIsraelite descent and racial prejudices. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcalled the Arabs Gentiles, which did not mean\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tilliterate or uneducated, but savage and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tuncivilized people. They believed that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGentiles were not entitled to any human rights,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthese were reserved only for the Israelites, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore, it was lawful and right for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIsraelites to defraud them of their properties by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tevery means.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEconomically they were much stronger than the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArabs. Since they had emigrated from the more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcivilized and culturally advanced countries of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPalestine and Syria, they knew many such arts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat were unknown to the Arabs; they also enjoyed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade relations with the outside world. Hence,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthey had captured the business of importing grain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin Yathrib and the upper Hijaz and exporting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdried dates to other countries. Poultry farming\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand fishing also were mostly under their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcontrols. They excelled at cloth weaving as well.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Jews had also set up wine shops in different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tareas, where they sold wine which was imported\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Syria.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThey would not allow the Arabs to be united and,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore, kept them fighting and entrenched\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst each other. They knew that whenever the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArab tribes united, they would not allow the Jews\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto remain in possession of their large\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tproperties, gardens and fertile lands, which they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thad come to own through their profiteering and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmoney lending businesses. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSuch were the conditions when Islam came to Madinah, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tultimately an Islamic State came into existence after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's (upon whom be Allah's peace) arrival there. One\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the first things that he accomplished was unification\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Aus, the Khazraj and the Emigrants into a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrotherhood. The second was that he concluded a treaty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween the Muslims and the Jews on definite conditions,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin which it was pledged that neither party would encroach\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the rights of the other, and both would unite in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjoint defence against the external enemies. Some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant clauses of this treaty are as follows. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclearly show what the Jews and the Muslims had pledged to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadhere to in their mutual relationship:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Jews must bear their expenses and the Muslims their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpenses. Each must help the other against anyone who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattacks the people of this document. They must seek\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmutual advice and consultation, and loyalty is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprotection against treachery. They shall sincerely wish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone another well. Their relations will be governed by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpiety and recognition of the rights of others, and not by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsin and wrongdoing. The wronged must be helped. The Jews\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmust pay with the believers so long as the war lasts.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYathrib shall be a sanctuary for the people of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdocument. If any dispute or controversy likely to cause\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrouble should arise, it must be referred to God and to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad the Apostle of God; the Qureysh and their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelpers shall not be given protection. The contracting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparties are bound to help one another against any attack\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton Yathrib. Every one shall be responsible for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefense of the portion to which he belongs.\" (Ibn Hisham,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvol. ii, pp. 147 to 150)\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis was on absolute and definitive covenant to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions of which the Jews themselves had agreed. But\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot very long after this they began to show hostility\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttowards the Prophet of Allah (upon whom be Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace). Islam and the Muslims, and their hostility and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperverseness continued increasing day by day. Its main\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcauses were the following three:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst, they envisaged the Prophet (upon whom be Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) merely as a chief of his people, who should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontent to have concluded a political agreement with them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand should only concern himself with the worldly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterests of his group. But they found that he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textending an invitation to believe in Allah, His Rasool\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Book (which also included belief in their own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphets and scriptures).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe was urging the people to give up disobedience of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand adopt obedience to the Divine Commands and abide by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe moral laws of their own prophets. This they could not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagree with. They feared that if this universal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tideological movement gained momentum, it would destroy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir rigid religiosity and wipe out their racial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnationhood.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSecond, when they saw that the Aus, the Khazraj and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmigrants were uniting into a brotherhood and the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the Arab tribes of the surrounding areas, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentered Islam, were also joining this Islamic Brotherhood\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Madinah and forming a religious community. They feared\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the selfish policy that they had been following of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsowing discord between the Arab tribes for the promotion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof their own well being and interests for centuries,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould not work in the new system. They knew that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould inevitably face a united front of the Arabs against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich their intrigues would not succeed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThird, the work that the Messenger of Allah (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace) was carrying out of reforming the society\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand civilization included putting an end to all unlawful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmethods in business and mutual dealings. Moreover, he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeclared the taking and giving of usury as impure and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunlawful earning. This caused them the fear that, if his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trule became established in Arabia, he would declare\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterest legally forbidden. In this they saw their own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teconomic disaster and death.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor these reasons they made resistance and opposition to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet their national ideal. They would not hesitate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto employ any trick, any device and cunning, to harm him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey spread every kind of falsehood so as to cause\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistrust against him in the people's minds. They created\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery kind of doubt, suspicion and misgiving in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thearts of the new converts so as to turn them back from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam. They would resort to every kind of deceit and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfraud in order to harm the Muslims economically. Whenever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone with whom they had business dealings with would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept Islam, they would do whatever they could to cause\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim financial loss. If he owed them something, they would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfret and harass him by making repeated demands, and if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey owed him something, they would withhold the payment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand would publicly say that, at the time the bargain was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade, he professed a different religion, and since he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchanged his religion, they were no longer under any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligation to repay him. Several instances of this nature\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare cited in the commentaries by Tabari, Nisaburi,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTabrizi and in Ruh al Ma'ani relating to verse 75 of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Al-Imran.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey had adopted this hostile attitude against the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcovenant even before the Battle of Badr. But when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and the Muslims won\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta decisive victory over the Qureysh at Badr, they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfilled with grief, anguish, malice and anger. Ka'b bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAshraf, the chief of the Bani an-Nadhir, cried out: \"By\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod, if Muhammad has actually killed these nobles of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia, the earth's belly would be better for us than its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tback.\" Then he went to Makkah and incited the people to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvengeance by writing and reciting provocative elegies for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qureysh chiefs killed at Badr. Then he returned to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah and composed lyrical verses of an insulting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnature about Muslim women. At last, enraged with Ka'b Bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAshraf's mischief, the Prophet (pbuh) sentenced him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath. (Ibn Sad, Ibn Hisham, Tabari).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe first Jewish tribe which, after the Battle of Badr,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topenly and collectively broke their covenant were the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBani Qainuqa. They lived in a locality inside the city of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah. As they practised the crafts of the goldsmith,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblacksmith and vessel maker, the people of Madinah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvisited their shops fairly frequently. They were proud of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir bravery and velour. Being blacksmiths by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprofession, even their children were well armed. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould instantly muster 700 fighting men from among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves. They were also arrogantly aware that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoyed relations of confederacy with the Khazraj and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdullah bin Ubayy, the chief of the, Khazraj, was their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchief supporter. At the victory at Badr, they became so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovoked that they began to trouble and harass the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims; Muslim women in particular, who visited their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshops. By and by things came to such a pass that one day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta Muslim woman was stripped naked publicly in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbazaar. This led to a brawl in which a Muslim and a Jew\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere killed. The Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself visited the local Jewish tribe, got them together\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand counselled them on decent conduct. But the reply that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey gave was; \"O Muhammad, you perhaps think we are like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qureysh; they did not know fighting; therefore, you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toverpowered them. But, when you come in contact with us,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou will see how men fight.\" This was in clear words a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeclaration of war. Consequently, the Prophet (upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe Allah's peace) laid siege to their quarters in A. H.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t2. The siege had hardly lasted for a fortnight when they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurrendered and all their fighting men were bound and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken prisoners. Abdullah bin Ubayy came up in support of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem and requested that they should be pardoned. The Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet conceded his request and decided that the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQainuqa would be exiled from Madinah leaving their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperties, armor and tools of trade behind. (Ibn Sa'd,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Hisham, Tarikh Tabari).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor some time after these punitive measures (i. e. the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbanishment of the Qainuqa and killing of Ka'b bin Ashraf\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t) the Jews remained so terror stricken that they did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdare commit any further mischief. But later in Shawwal,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA. H. 3 the Qureysh, in order to avenge themselves for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe defeat at Badr, marched against Madinah with great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreparations. The Jews saw that only one thousand men had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarched out with the Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin comparison to three thousand men of the Qureysh. To\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake matter worse 300 hypocrites initially joined the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, deserted and returned to Madinah. At this point,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey committed the first and open breach of the treaty by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefusing to join the Prophet in the defense of the city\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven though they were bound to it by the agreement. Then,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen in the Battle of Uhud the Muslims suffered a set\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tback, they were further emboldened. So much so that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBani an-Nadhir made a secret plan to kill the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(pbuh). The plan, however, failed before it could be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texecuted.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs a result, there was no question of showing them any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfurther concession. The Holy Prophet at once sent to them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe ultimatum that the treachery they had meditated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst him had come to his knowledge. Therefore, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere to leave Madinah within ten days. If anyone of them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas found staying behind in their quarters, he would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tput to the sword. Meanwhile, Abdullah bin Ubayy sent them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe message that he would help them with two thousand men\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand that the Bani Quraizah and Bani Ghatfan would also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcome to their aid. Therefore, they were to stand firm and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot go. On this false assurance, they responded to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's ultimatum saying that they would not leave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah and that he could do whatever was in his power.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConsequently, in Rabi-al-Awwal, A. H. 4, the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(pbuh) laid siege to them, and after a few days of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsiege they surrendered on the condition that they could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttake their personal property, except the armor, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould be carried on three camels. Thus, Madinah was rid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof this second mischievous tribe of Jews. Only two of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBani an-Nadhir embraced Islam and stayed behind. All of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe others went to Syria and Khayber.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

He had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttried to inform the enemy of a very important war\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsecret of the Prophet (upon whom be Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) only for the sake of safe guarding his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfamily. This would have caused great bloodshed at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe conquest of Makkah had it not been made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tineffective in time. It would have cost the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims many precious lives; many of the Qureysh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twould have been killed, many of whom would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trendered great services to Islam afterward; the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgains which were to accrue from conquering Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeacefully would have been lost.

The incident\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat occurred on this occasion was not a chance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappening, but had a whole series of events behind it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall of which ultimately led up to it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBefore the Prophet's migration to Madinah the tribes of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Aus and the Khazraj, fed up with their mutual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trivalries and civil wars, had almost agreed on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleadership of one man and were making preparations to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcrown him their king. This was Abdullah bin Ubayy bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSalul, the chief of the Khazraj. Muhammad bin Ishaq has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstated that among the people of Khazraj his authority was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnever contested and never had the Aus and the Khazraj\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trallied to one man before this.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the Prophet arrived in Madinah, Islam had so deeply\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpenetrated every house of the Ansar that Abdullah bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUbayy became helpless and did not see any other way to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsave his leadership than to become a Muslim himself. So,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the entered Islam along with many of his followers from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the chiefs and leaders of both the tribes although\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir hearts were burning with rage from within. Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUbayy in particular was filled with grief, for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (pbuh) had deprived him of his kingship. For\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseveral years his hypocritical faith and grief of being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeprived of his kingdom manifested itself in different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tways. On the one hand, when on Fridays the Prophet (pbuh)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttook his seat to deliver the Sermon, Abdullah bin Ubayy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould stand up and say \"O people, the Rasool of Allah is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresent among you, by whom Allah has honored you;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore, you should support him, listen to what he says\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand obey him.\" (Ibn Hisham, vol. III, p. 111). On the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother, his hypocrisy was being exposed day by day and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrue Muslims were realizing that he and his followers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbore great malice against Islam, the Prophet and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Summary of the hypocrites behavior:</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOnce when the Prophet was passing along the way,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdullah bin Ubayy spoke to him in harsh words.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the Prophet complained of it to Sayyiduna\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSa'd bin Ubadah, he said: \"O Rasool of Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdon't be hard on him, for when Allah sent you to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tus we were about to crown him, and, by God, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthinks that you have robbed him of his kingdom.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Ibn Hisham vol: II, pp. 237-238).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter the Battle of Badr when the Prophet (pbuh)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinvaded the Jewish tribe of Bani Qainuqa for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreaking their agreement and unprovoked revolt,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthis man stood up in support of them, and holding\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet by his armor, said: \"These 700\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfighters have been helping and protecting me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst every enemy; would you cut them down in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tone morning? By God, I will not leave you until\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tyou pardon my clients.\" (Ibn Hisham, vol. III,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpp. 5l-52)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the occasion of the Battle of Uhud this man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcommitted open treachery and withdrew from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbattlefield with 300 of his companions. One\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tshould note that at this critical moment when he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tso acted, the Qureysh had marched upon Madinah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twith 3,000 troops and the Prophet had marched out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twith only 1,000 men to resist them. Of these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1,000 this hypocrite broke away with 300 men and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet was left with only 700 men to meet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t3,000 troops of the enemy on the field. After\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthis incident the common Muslims of Madinah came\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto realize that he was certainly a hypocrite and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tso were his companions. That is why when on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tvery first Friday, after the Battle of Uhud, this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tman stood up as usual to make a speech before the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's Sermon, the people pulled at his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgarment, saying \"Sit down you are not worthy to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsay any thing.\" That was the first occasion in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah when this man was publicly disgraced.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThereupon he was so filled with rage that he left\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mosque jumping over the heads of the people.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAt the door of the Mosque some of the Ansar said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto him, \"What are you doing? Go back and ask the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (upon whom be Allah's peace) to pray for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tyour forgiveness.\" He retorted \"I do not want him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto pray for my forgiveness.\" (Ibn Hisham, vol.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIII, p. 111)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn A. H. 4 the Battle of Bani an-Nadir took\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tplace. On this occasion he and his companions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsupported the enemies of Islam even more openly.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the one side, the Prophet (pbuh) and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdevoted companions were preparing for war against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir enemy, the Jews, and on the other, these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites were secretly sending messages to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJews to the effect: \"Stand firm we are with you:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif you are attacked, we will help you, and if you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tare driven out, we too will go out with you.\" The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsecret of this intrigue was exposed by Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHimself, as has been explained in Surah Al-Hashr\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tverses 11-17. Inspite of being so exposed the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treason why the Prophet (pbuh) was still treating\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thim kindly was that he had a large band of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites behind him. Many of the chiefs of both\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Aus and the Khazraj were his supporters. At\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tleast a third of the population of Madinah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconsisted of his companions, as became manifest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ton the occasion of the Battle of Uhud. Under such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions it was not prudent to wage a war with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthese internal and external enemies combined. On\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthis very account, inspite of being fully aware\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof their hypocrisy, the Prophet for a long time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinued to deal with them according to their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tapparent profession of faith.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen Abdullah bin Ubayy, and like minded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites, got an opportunity to accompany the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (pbuh) in his campaign against the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAl- Mustaliq, they engineered two great mischiefs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhich could shatter the Muslim unity to pieces.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, by virtue of the wonderful training in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscipline that the Muslims had received through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe pure teaching of the Qur'an and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanionship of the Prophet (pbuh) both\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmischiefs were stopped in time, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites themselves were disgraced instead. One\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof these was the mischief that is mentioned in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah An-Nur, and the other in this Surah. These\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tincidents are related by Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmed,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNasai, Tirmidhi, Baihaqi, Tabari, Ibn Marduyah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdur Razzaq, lbn Jarir Tabari, Ibn Sa'd and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad bin Ishaq through many reliable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tchannels.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

A minor incident experienced by an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tordinary man in his life may not be of any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequence, but it assumes the status of law\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhen experienced by a Prophet. That is why the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlives of the Prophets have been kept under close\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsupervision by Allah so that none of their acts,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnot even a most trivial one, may deviate from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDivine Will.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Prophet (pbuh) was checked on a minor thing,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhich was not only corrected but also recorded.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt gives us complete satisfaction that whatever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tactions, commands and instructions we now find in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe documented life of the Prophet concerning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhich there is nothing on record in the nature of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcriticism or correction from Allah. We can trust\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they are wholly based on truth, are in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplete conformity with Divine Will and that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tguidance can be drawn from them with full\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconfidence and peace of mind.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt has been stated in this Surah that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, whose reverence and respect Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHimself has enjoined as a necessary part of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfaith of His servants, once during his sacred\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlife made a thing declared lawful by Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tunlawful for himself only to please his wives.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah severely reproved of their errors, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twives of the Prophet whom Allah Himself has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdeclared as mothers of the faithful; worthy of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe highest esteem and honor. Further, this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcriticism of the Prophet and the administration\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof the warning to his wives was made not secretly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbut included in the Book, which the entire Ummah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thas to read and recite forever. Obviously, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tintention of making mention of this instance in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Book of Allah was not, nor could it have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen, that Allah wanted to degrade His Rasool and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Mothers of the Faithful in the eyes of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers. It is also obvious that no Muslim has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlost respect for them after reading this Surah of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qur'an. There cannot be any other reason of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioning this instance in the Qur'an other than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Allah wants to acquaint the believers with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe correct manner of reverence for their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonalities. A Prophet is a Prophet, not God,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand he may commit error. Respect of the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thas not been enjoined because he is infallible,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbut because he is a perfect representative of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDivine Will, and Allah has not permitted any of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\this errors to pass unnoticed. This gives us the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsatisfaction that the noble pattern of life left\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tby the Prophet wholly and fully represents the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWill of Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is made explicitly clear that Allah's religion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tis absolutely fair and just. It has for every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tperson just the recompense of which he becomes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tworthy of on the basis of his faith and works. No\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trelationship or connection, even with the most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trighteous person or the most evil person, can be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbeneficial for him in any way. In reference to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthis, three kinds of women have been cited as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\texamples before the the Prophet's wives in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tparticular.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol type='A'>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOne example is of the wives of the Prophets Noah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Lot, who, if they had believed and cooperated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twith their illustrious husbands, would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\toccupied the same rank and position in the Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcommunity which is enjoyed by the wives of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Muhammad (pbuh). Since they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers, however, their being the wives of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophets did not save them from hell.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe second example is of the wife of Pharaoh, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin spite of being the wife of a staunch enemy of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGod believed and chose a path of action separate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom that followed by the Pharaoh's people. Her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing the wife of a staunch disbeliever did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcause her any harm, and Allah made her worthy of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tParadise.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe third example is of Sayyidah Maryam (Mary)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon her), who attained to her high\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trank because she submitted to the severe test\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah decided to put her too. Apart from Maryam,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tno other chaste and righteous woman in history\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thas been put to such a difficult test. In spite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof being unmarried she was miraculously made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpregnant by Allah's command and informed of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tservice her Rabb willed to take from her. When\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSayyidah Maryam accepted this decision, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tagreed to bear, like a true believer, everything\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat she inevitably had to bear in order to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfulfil Allah's Will, then did Allah exalt her to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe noble rank of \"Sayyidahtu an-Nisa''\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFil-Jannah (Leader of the women in Paradise).\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Musnad Ahmed).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWe also learn from this Surah that the Prophet (pbuh) did\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot receive from Allah only that knowledge which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincluded and recorded in The Qur'an, but was additionally\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven information about other things also by revelation,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich was not recorded in The Qur'an. Clear proof of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis found in verse 3 of this Surah. In it we are told that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet (pbuh) confided a secret to one of his wives,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand she told it to another. Allah informed the Prophet of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis secret. Then, when the Prophet warned his particular\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twife on this mistake of disclosure she said: \"Who has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinformed you of this mistake of mine?\" He replied: \"I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been informed of it by Him Who knows everything and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis All Aware.\" The question is where in the Qur'an is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse in which Allah has said \"O Prophet, the secret that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou had confided to one of your wives has been disclosed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby her to another person?\" There is no such verse in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an. This is an express proof of the fact that some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttimes revelation thet descended on the Prophet was not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincluded in the Qur'an, and refutes the claim of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeniers of Hadith, who allege that nothing was sent down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Prophet (pbuh) apart from the Qur'an.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

All of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe powers of controlling, administering and ruling it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare also entirely in Allah's hands . This system is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreated without purpose and people have been sent here\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor a test. In this test they can succeed only by their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trighteous deeds and conduct. Then the dreadful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequences of disbelief which will appear in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter, are mentioned. The people are told that Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby sending His Prophets, has forewarned them of these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequences.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmphasis is made on the fact that the Creator is aware of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teach open and hidden secret of men, even the innermost\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tideas of their hearts. The right basis of morality is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat man should avoid evil and fear the accountability by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Rabb. Those who adopt such conduct will deserve\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforgiveness and a rich reward in the Hereafter. Reference\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis made to those common truths of daily occurrence to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich man does not pay much attention. He is told that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe earth on which he moves about with full satisfaction\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand peace of mind, and from which he obtains his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsustenance, is subdued for him by Allah. This earth might\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat any time start shaking suddenly so as to cause his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestruction, or a typhoon might occur, which may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tannihilate him completely. Look at the birds that fly in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe air: it is Allah Who is sustaining them in the air.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen man is reminded: \"Look at your own means and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresources. If Allah wills to inflict you with a scourge,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnone can save you from it; and if Allah wills to close\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe doors of sustenance on you, none can open them for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou. These things are there to make you aware of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruth, but you see them like animals, which are unable to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdraw conclusions from observations, and you do not use\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour sight, hearing and minds which Allah has bestowed on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou as men. You have to ultimately appear before your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRabb. It is not for the Prophet to tell you the exact\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime and date of that event. His only duty is to warn you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeforehand of its inevitable occurrence.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFinally a response is given to what the disbelievers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah said against the Prophet (pbuh) and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions. They cursed the Prophet and prayed for his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the believers destruction. To this it has been said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Whether those who call you to the right way are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestroyed, or shown mercy by Allah, how will their fate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchange your destiny? You should look after yourselves and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsider who would save you if you were overtaken by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscourge of Allah? You regard those who believe in Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand put their trust in Him as the misguided. A time will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcome when it will become evident as to who was really\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmisguided.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, the people are asked this question and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleft to ponder over it, \"if the water which has come out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the earth at some place in the desert or hill\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountry of Arabia and upon which depends your whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife's activity, should sink and vanish underground, who,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbesides Allah, can restore this life giving water to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou?\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topinion is not based on the realities and truths about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe universe and they have no direct knowledge that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjinn do not exist nor can they claim to possess any such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknowledge. They have assumed, without reason and proof,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat nothing exists in the universe except what they can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsee, whereas the sphere of human perception in accordance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the vastness of this great universe is not even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomparable to a drop of water in the oceans. The person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho thinks that what he does not see, does not exist, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat exists must necessarily be perceived, in fact,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovides a proof of the narrowness of his own mind. With\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis mode of thought, not to speak of the jinn, man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot even accept and acknowledge any reality which he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot directly experience and observe, thus he cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmit the existence of God, not to say admitting any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother unseen reality.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThose Muslims who have been influenced by such opinions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave given strange interpretations of the clear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatements of the Qur'an about the jinn, Iblees and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSatan. They say that the word jinn does not refer to any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thidden creature, which may have its own independent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texistence, but it sometimes implies man's own animal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforces, which have been called Satanic, and it sometimes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timplies savage and wild mountain tribes, and to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople who used to listen to the Qur'an secretly. But the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatements of the Qur'an in this regard are so clear and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplicit that these interpretations bear no relevance.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Qur'an frequently mentions the jinn and the men in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanner as to indicate that they are two separate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreations. For example:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Al-A'raf: 12, Al Hijr : 26-27 and Ar-Rahman :\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t14-19, expressly state that man was created out of clay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand jinn out of fire.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Al Hijr: 27, states that the jinn had been created\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore man. The same thing is testified by the story of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAdam and Iblees, which has been cited at seven different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplaces in the Qur'an, and at every place it confirms that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIblees was already there at the creation of man.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Al-K'ahf: 50, states that Iblees was a jinn. Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-A'raf: 27, states in clear words that the jinn see\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thuman beings, but human beings do not see them.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Al-Hijr: 16-l8, Surah As-Saffat: 6-10 and Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Mulk: 5, state that the jinn can ascend to the heavens\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut they cannot exceed a certain limit; if they try to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tascend beyond that limit and try to hear what goes on in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe heavens, they will not be allowed to do so. If they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttry to eavesdrop they will be driven away by meteorites.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBy this, the belief of the polytheistic Arabs that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjinn possess knowledge of the unseen, or have access to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDivine secrets, has been refuted.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Saba: 14 affirms the same facts.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs Al-Baqarah: 30-34 and Al-K'ahf: 50 state that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah has entrusted man with the vicegerency of the earth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand that mankind are superior to the jinn. Although the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjinn also have been given certain extraordinary powers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand abilities, an example of which is found in An-Naml\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t39, the animals likewise have been given some powers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreater than man, but these provide no argument that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanimals are superior to man.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Qur'an also explains that the jinn, like men, are a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreation and are given the power and authority to choose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween right and wrong, obedience and disobedience,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelief and disbelief. This fact has been confirmed by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an in the story of Adam, where Iblees (Satan) refused\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto obey Allah's order to bow down to Adam. A similar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevent where jinn affirm Faith is stated in Surahs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Ahqaf and Al-Jinn. At various places in the Qur'an, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas also been stated that Iblees, at the very creation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAdam, had resolved to misguide mankind, and since then,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Satanic jinn have been persistently trying to mislead\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman, but they do not have the power to overwhelm him and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforcibly make him do something. However, they inspire him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith evil suggestions, beguile him and make evil seem\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgood to him. (Examples of this phenomenon are given in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah An-Nisa' 117-120, Al-A'raf: 11-17, Ibrahim: 22,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Hijr: 30-42, An-Nahl 98-100, Bani Israel 61-65.) The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an also states that in the pre Islamic ignorance, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpolytheistic Arabs regarded the jinn as associates of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod, worshipped them and thought they had descended from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod. For reference see Surahs A1-An'am: 100, Saba :\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t40-41, As-Saffat: 158.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFrom these details, it becomes clear that the jinn have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir own existence, are an invisible creature and of an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentirely different nature. Because of their mysterious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqualities, ignorant people have formed exaggerated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnotions and concepts about them and their powers, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave even worshipped them.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

He was only initiated into it and then left\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talone for a while in order to absorb the great strain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis experience had caused him and to allow him to become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentally prepared to receive the revelation and perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe prophetic mission in the future. After this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintermission, when the revelation was resumed, the first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseven verses of Surah Al-Muddaththir were revealed. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese Ayat, he was for the first time commanded to arise\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand warn the people of the consequences of the way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife they were following and to proclaim the greatness of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah in a world where others were being magnified\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout any justification. He was given this instruction:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The demand of the unique mission that you are to perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnow, is that your life should be pure in every respect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand you should carry out the duty of reforming your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople sincerely, irrespective of any worldly gain.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, in the last sentence, he is exhorted to endure with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpatience, for the sake of his Rabb, all the hardships and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttroubles that he might have to face while performing his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmission.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the implementation of this Divine Command, when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet began to preach Islam and recite the Qur'anic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs revealed successively, the people of Makkah felt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talarmed, and it provoked a great storm of opposition and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thostility. A few months passed in this state until the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj season approached. The people of Makkah feared that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif Muhammad (pbuh) started visiting the caravans of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpilgrims coming from all over Arabia at their resting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplaces reciting the spell binding and unique verses of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qur'an to their assemblies, his message would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teventually reach every part of Arabia and influence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountless people. Therefore, the Qureysh chiefs held a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconference and decided that they would start a propaganda\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcampaign against the Prophet (pbuh) among the pilgrims as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsoon as they arrived. After they had agreed on this,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWalid bin Al-Mughirah said to the assembled people: \"If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou say contradictory things about Muhammad, we all would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlose our trust among the people. Therefore, let us agree\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon one opinion, which we should all say without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdispute. They all requested Walid to come up with some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatement and he said: \"Let me think it over for awhile.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, after prolonged thought and consideration, he said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The nearest thing to the truth is that you tell the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabs that he is a sorcerer, who has brought a message by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich he separates a man from his father, and from his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrother, and from his wife and children, and from his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfamily.\" They all agreed on what Walid had proposed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, in accordance to the scheme, the men of Qureysh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspread out among the pilgrims of Hajj and warned everyone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they should avoid the sorcery of Muhammad through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich he stirs up division among the families.\" But the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplan, which the Qureysh chiefs carried out, yielded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresults contrary to what they had expected and actually\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfavored the Prophet and his name became known throughout\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia. (Ibn Hisham, pp. 288-289).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, this Surah clearly states: \"Allah does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstand in need of anybody's faith.

After this, man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been warned: \"Beginning your creation in this way, We\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave developed and shaped you into what you are today in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torder to test and try you in the world.

These two things are not mentioned with a view to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshow what good or evil result is entailed by them in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttransitory life of this world, but they have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned only to point out what enduring results they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill produce in the eternal and everlasting life of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter, irrespective of whether an evil quality may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprove useful or a good quality may prove harmful during\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir life in the world.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the second section, addressing the Prophet (pbuh),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree things are stated:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is in fact We, Ourself are revealing this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an piecemeal to you, and this is intended to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinform the disbelievers, not you, that the Qur'an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tis not being fabricated by Muhammad (pbuh), but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tit is We, Who are revealing it, and it is Our Own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twisdom which requires that We should reveal it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpiece by piece and not all at once.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNo matter how long it may take for the decree of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tyour Lord to be enforced, and no matter what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tafflictions may befall you in the meantime, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tany case, you should continue to perform your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmission of Risalat patiently, and not yield to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe pressure tactics of any of these wicked and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tunbelieving people.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRemember Allah day and night, perform the Prayer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand spend your nights in the worship of Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfor it is these things which sustain and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tstrengthen those who call to Allah in the face of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tiniquity and disbelief.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, it is said: \"This Qur'an is an admonition;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhoever wills may accept it and take the path to his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRabb.

The power\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof All-Mighty Allah Who has established this wonderful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsystem on the earth, is not helpless in bringing about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Resurrection and the express wisdom which underlies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis system bears full evidence that the Hereafter must\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappear, for no act of an All- Wise Creator is vain and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurposeless, and if there was no Hereafter, it would mean\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat of this life is useless and purposeless.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn vv. 16-28 arguments are given for the occurrence and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessity of the Resurrection and Hereafter. Man's own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory, his own birth, and the structure of the earth on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich he lives, bears the testimony that the coming of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Resurrection and the establishment of the Hereafter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare possible as well as the demand of Allah Almighty's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twisdom. History tells us that the nations which denied\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hereafter ultimately became corrupted and met with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestruction. This means that the Hereafter is a truth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich, if denied and contradicted by a nation through its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconduct and attitude, will cause it to meet the same fate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas would be a blind man who rushes headlong into an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapproaching train. It also means that in the Kingdom of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe universe, not only physical laws are at work, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso moral laws, under which the process of retribution\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis operating. But since in the present life of the world\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tretribution is not taking place in its complete and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperfect form, the moral law of the universe necessarily\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemands that there should come a time when it should take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits full course, and all those good works and evil deeds,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich could not be rewarded here, or which escaped their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdue punishment, should be fully rewarded and punished.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor this purpose, it is inevitable that there should be a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecond life after death. If man only considers how he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttakes his birth in the world, his intellect, provided it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis sound intellect, cannot deny that Allah, Who began his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreation from an insignificant sperm drop and developed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim into a perfect human being, is able to create the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame human being once again.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the end, the deniers of the Hereafter and those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tturn away from Allah's worship, are warned: \"Enjoy your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshort-lived worldly pleasure as you may, but your end\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill ultimately be disastrous.\" The discourse concludes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the assertion that the one who fails to obtain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguidance from the Qur'an, can have no other source of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGuidance.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

When the Prophet (pbuh) first started to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreach Islam at Makkah, his message consisted of three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telements:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat none be held as an associate with Allah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGodhead.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat Allah had appointed him as His Messenger.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis world will come to an end one day and then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tanother world will be established when all the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tformer and the latter generations will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tresurrected with the same bodies in which they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlived and worked in the world; then they will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcalled to account for their beliefs and deeds and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who emerge as believing and righteous in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthis accountability will go to paradise and those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twho are proved to be disbelieving and wicked will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlive in hell for ever.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOf these, the first item was highly unpleasant for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of Makkah, they were not disbelievers in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texistence of Allah. They believed in His Being the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSupreme Sustainer, Creator and Providence and also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmitted that all those beings whom they regarded as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir deities, were themselves Allah's creatures.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, in this regard the only thing they disputed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas whether they had any share in the attributes and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpowers of Divinity and in the Divine Being itself or not.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs for the second item, the people of Makkah were not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprepared to accept it. However, what they could not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossibly deny was that during the 40 year life the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (pbuh) had lived amongst them before his claim to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood, they had never found him lying or deceitful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor one who would adopt unlawful methods for selfish ends.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs for the third thing, resurrection, they mocked it most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand expressed unusual wonder at it, and regarding it as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremote from reason and impossible. They talked about it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas incredible, even inconceivable, in their assemblies.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, reference is made to the common talk and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoubts that were being expressed in every street of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah and in every assembly of the people on hearing the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnews about Resurrection. Then, the deniers have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked: \"Don't you see this earth which We have spread as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta carpet for you? Don't you see the high mountains which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twe have so firmly placed in the earth? Don't you consider\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour own selves how We have created you as pairs of men\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand women? Don't you consider your sleep by which We make\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou seek a few hours rest after every few hours labor and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoil so as to keep you fit for work in the world? Don't\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou see the alternation of the night and day which We are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso regularly perpetuating precisely according to your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneeds and requirements? Don't you see the strongly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfortified system of the heavens above you? Don't you see\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sun by means of which you are receiving your light\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand heat? Don't you see the rains which fall from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclouds and help produce corn and vegetables and gardens?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDo these things only tell you that the power of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAlmighty Being Who has created them, will be unable to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbring about Resurrection and establish the Next World?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, from the supreme wisdom which is clearly working in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis world around you, do you only understand that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talthough each function of it is for a purpose, life is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyet meaningless? Nothing could be more absurd and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaningless, that man after being granted vast powers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappropriation in this world be let off without any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccountability.

None will speak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout leave and leave for intercession will be given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly for those who had acknowledged the Truth in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld; rebels of God and rejectors of the Truth will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeserve no intercession at all.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

But in reading the whole Surah objectively,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone finds that the displeasure, in fact, is expressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst the disbelieving Qureysh, who, because of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarrogant attitude and indifference, were rejecting the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage of truth with contempt.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe error in the method that the Prophet adopted at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstart of his mission is also pointed out. His treating of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe blind man with neglect and disregard, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequently devoting all of his attention to the Qureysh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchiefs was not because he regarded the rich as noble and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta poor blind man as contemptible.

He never had to encounter the conditions which he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuddenly had to encounter after embarking on his mission\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof inviting people to Islam. This was by itself a great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevolution in his life. When he started preaching the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage of Islam, the same society which had esteemed him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith unique honor, turned hostile to him. The same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelatives and friends, the same clansmen and neighbors,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho used to treat him with the highest respect, began to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshower him with abuse and insult. No one in Makkah was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprepared to listen to him; he was being ridiculed and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmocked in the street and on the road; and at every step\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the had to face new difficulties. Although he gradually\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecame accustomed to the hardships, even as they became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore severe, yet the initial stage was very discouraging\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor him. That is why Surah Ad-Duha was sent down first to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsole him, and then this Surah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah states that Allah has bestowed three major\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfavors on the Prophet: the first is the blessing of Sharh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSadr (opening up of the breast), the second by removing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom him the heavy burden that was weighing down his back\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the call, and the third by exalting his renown the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike of which has never been granted to any man before.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, the Prophet is instructed: \"You can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdevelop the power to bear and resist the hardships of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinitial stage only by one means, and it is this: `When\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou are free from your occupations, you should devote\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyourself to the labor and toil of worship, and turn all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour attention exclusively to your Rabb.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

For this purpose, first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tswearing an oath by the two sacred places (Mount of Tur\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Makkah where Allah revealed His message to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Moses and the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem) it is stated that Allah has created man in the most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcellent of moulds. This signifies that man has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessed with such excellent capabilities that he can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattain the highest position which has not been attained\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby any other creature. Then, it is pointed out that there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare two kinds of men:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThose who inspite of having been created in the finest of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmoulds, become inclined to evil and their moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdegeneration causes them to be reduced to the lowest of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe low.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThose, who by adopting the way of faith and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trighteousness, remain secure from degeneration and are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsistent with the noble position, which is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary demand of their having been created in the best\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof moulds.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe existence among mankind of both these kinds is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfactual thing which no one can deny. It is being observed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand experienced in society everywhere at all times.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, this reality is used as an argument to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprove that when among the people there exist two separate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand quite distinct kinds, how can one deny the judgement\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand retribution for deeds. If the morally degraded people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare not punished and the morally pure people are not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trewarded (both end in the dust alike), it would mean that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is no justice in the Kingdom of God, whereas human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnature and common sense demands that a judge should do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjustice. How then can one conceive that Allah, Who is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost just of all judges, would not be just?\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

First, it is the night during which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestinies are decided. The revelation of this Book in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis night is not merely the revelation of a book, but an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevent which will change the destiny of the entire world.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe other meaning is that this is a night of unique\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thonor, dignity and glory; so much so that it is better\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan a thousand months. Thus, the disbelievers of Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been warned: \"You, on account of your ignorance,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregard this Book, which Muhammad (pbuh) has presented, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta calamity for yourselves and complain that a disaster\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas befallen you, whereas the night in which it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecreed to be sent down was such a blessed night worth;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore than a thousand months.

The cause of their straying into different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreeds was not that Allah had not provided any guidance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto them, but that they strayed only after a clear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatement of the True religion had come to them. From\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis, it automatically follows that they themselves were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponsible for their error and deviation. If after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcoming of the clear statement through Prophet Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(pbuh they continued to stray, their responsibility would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfurther increase.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Prophets who came from Allah and the Books sent down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Him, did not enjoin anything but that the way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsincere and true service to Allah be adopted; apart from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall other ways, no one else's worship, service or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobedience be mixed with His; the Salah be established and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Zakah be paid. This has always been the true\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligion. From this, it also automatically follows that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe followers of the earlier scriptures, straying from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis true religion, have added extraneous things to it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich are false, and Allah's Rasool has come to invite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem back to the same original faith.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, it is pointed out that the followers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe earlier Books and the idol worshippers who would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefuse to acknowledge this Message are the worst of all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreatures. Their punishment will be an everlasting hell;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the people who would believe and act righteously are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe best of all creatures.

Every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArab was fully conscious of this state of affairs and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealized that it was wrong. Although the plundered\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbemoaned his miserable, helpless state and the plunderer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trejoiced when the plunderer himself was plundered, he too\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealized how abject was the condition in which the whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnation was involved.

After stating this kind of ugly character, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tultimate end of such a people in the Hereafter is told.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBoth of these things (i. e. the character and ones fate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the Hereafter) are depicted in a way which makes the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlistener automatically reach the conclusion that such a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman deserves to meet such an end. And since in the world,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of such character may not suffer and appear to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthriving instead, the occurrence of the Hereafter becomes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsolutely inevitable.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf this Surah is read in the sequence of the Surahs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeginning with Az-Zilzal, one can fully understand the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfundamental beliefs of Islam. In Surah Az-Zilzal, it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid that in the Hereafter, man's full record will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplaced before him and not an atom's weight of good or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevil done by him in the world will have been left\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunrecorded. In Surah Al-'Adiyat, attention was drawn to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe plunder, loot, bloodshed and vandalism, prevailing in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia before Islam; then making the people realize, that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe way the powers given by God were being abused, was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindeed an expression of sheer ingratitude to Him and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeserves punishment. In Surah Al-Qariah, after depicting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Resurrection, the people were warned that in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter, a man's good or evil end will be dependent on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhether the scale of his good deeds was heavier, or the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscale of his evil deeds was heavier. In Surah At-\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTakathur the people were taken to task for their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaterialistic mentality because of which, they remained\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccupied in seeking increase in worldly benefits,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpleasures, comforts and position. They were warned that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey would have to render an account to their Rabb and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSustainer as to how they obtained it and how they used\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit. In Surah Al-'Asr, it was declared that each member,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teach group and each community of mankind, even the entire\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld of humanity, was in manifest loss if its members\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere devoid of faith, righteous deeds and the practice of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texhorting others to truth and patience. Immediately after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis comes Surah Al-Humazah, in which, after presenting a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecimen of leadership of the pre-Islamic age of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tignorance, the people are asked the question: \"What\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould such character deserve, if not loss and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperdition?\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

That's why the Arabs believed that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKa'bah was protected in this invasion, not by any god or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoddess, but by Allah Almighty Himself. Then Allah Alone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas invoked by the Qureysh chiefs for help, and for quite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta few years the people of Qureysh, having been impressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby this event, had worshipped none but Allah. Therefore,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere was no need to mention the details in Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Feel, but only a reference to it was enough.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>History of attack on Ka&apos;bah</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to Arab historians, the Abyssinian army that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvaded Yaman had two commanders, Aryat and Abrahah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAryat was killed in an encounter, and Abrahah took\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontrol of the country; then somehow he persuaded the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbyssinian king to appoint him his viceroy over Yaman.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis man was the slave of a Greek merchant of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbyssinian seaport of Adolis, who, by clever diplomacy,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad come to wield great influence in the Abyssinian army\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccupying Yaman. The troops sent by the Negus (king of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbyssinia) to punish him either warned him or were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefeated by him. Subsequently, after the death of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tking, his successor was reconciled to accept him as his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvicegerent of Yaman. Through passage of time, he became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan independent ruler of Yaman. He acknowledged the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsovereignty of the Negus only in name and described\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself as his deputy.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter stabilizing his rule in Yaman, Abrahah turned his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattention to the objective which from the very beginning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof this campaign had been before the Byzantine empire and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits allies, the Abyssinian Christians. This was to spread\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChristianity in Arabia and to capture the trade that was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcarried out through the Arabs between the eastern lands\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Byzantine dominions. The need for this increased\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause the Byzantine struggle for power against the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSasanian empire of Iran had blocked all the routes of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tByzantine trade with the East.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTo achieve this objective, Abrahah built in Sana, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcapital of Yaman, a magnificent cathedral called by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabian historians Al-Qalis. After completing the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbuilding, he wrote to king Negus, saying: \"I shall not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trest until I have diverted the Arabs pilgrimage to it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSo, in 570 or 571 A. D., he took 60,000 troops and 13\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telephants (according to another tradition, 9 elephants)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand set off for Makkah. According to Muhammad bin Ishaq,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen he was within three miles of Makkah at a place\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcalled 'al- Mughammas,' Abrahah sent his vanguard forward\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand they brought him the plunder of the people of Tihamah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Qureysh, which included two hundred camels of Abdul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuttalib, the grandfather of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, he sent an envoy of his to Makkah with the message\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he had not come to fight the people of Makkah, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly to destroy the House (i. e. the Ka'bah). If they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffered no resistance, there would be no cause for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbloodshed. Abrahah also instructed his envoy that if the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of Makkah wanted to negotiate, he should bring\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir leader to him. The leader of Makkah at that time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas Abdul Muttalib. The envoy went to him and delivered\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbrahah's message. Abdul Muttalib replied: \"We have no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpower to fight Abrahah. This is Allah's House. If He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twills, He will save His House.\" The envoy asked him to go\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith him to Abrahah. He agreed and accompanied him to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tking. Abdul Muttalib was such a dignified and handsome\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman, that when Abrahah saw him he was much impressed; he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgot off his throne and sat beside him on the carpet. Then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the asked him what he wanted. Abdul Muttalib replied that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the wanted the king to return his camels which he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken. Abrahah said: \"I was much impressed when I saw\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou, but your reply has brought you down in my eyes; you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly demand your camels, but you say nothing about this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse which is your sanctuary and the sanctuary of your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforefathers.\" He replied: \"I am the owner of my camels\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand am requesting you to return them. As for the House,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit has its own Owner; He will defend it.\" When Abrahah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid that He would not be able to defend it against him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdul Muttalib said that it rested between Him (Allah)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand him (Abrahah). With this, Abdul Muttalib left Abrahah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho returned his camels to him.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOne thing which becomes evident from this tradition is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the tribes living in and around Makkah did not have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe power to fight such a big force and save the Ka'bah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, obviously, the Qureysh did not try to put up\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany resistance. The Qureysh on the occasion of the Battle\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Trench (Ahzab) had hardly been able to muster ten\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto twelve thousand men in spite of the alliance with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpagan and Jewish tribes; they could not have resisted an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarmy of 60,000 strong. Muhammad bin Ishaq says that after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturning from the camp of Abrahah, Abdul Muttalib\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tordered the Qureysh to withdraw from the city and go to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mountains along with their families for fear of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeneral massacre. Then, he went to the Ka'bah along with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome chiefs of the Qureysh and taking hold of the iron\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tring of the door, prayed to Allah Almighty. Ibn Hisham,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin his book 'Life of the Prophet,' has cited some verses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Abdul Muttalib:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"O God, a man protects his house, so protect Your House;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLet not their cross and their craft tomorrow overcome\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYour craft. If You will to leave them and our Qiblah to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves, You may do as You please. My Lord, I do not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcherish any hope from anyone against them except You. O\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmy Lord, protect Your House from them. The enemy of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse is Your enemy. Stop them from destroying Your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettlement.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter making these supplications Abdul Muttalib and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanions also went off to the mountains. The next\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmorning Abrahah prepared to enter Makkah, but his special\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telephant, Mahmud, which was in the forefront, knelt down.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt was beaten with iron bars, goaded, but it would not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tget up. When they made it face south, north, or east, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould immediately start off, but as soon as they directed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit towards Makkah, it knelt down. In the meantime swarms\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof birds appeared carrying stones in their beaks and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclaws and showered these on the troops. Whoever was hit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould start disintegrating. Ibn 'Abbas says that whoever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas struck by a pebble, would start scratching his body\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresulting in breaking of the skin and falling off of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflesh. In another tradition Ibn 'Abbas says that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflesh and blood flowed like water and bones in the body\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecame visible. The same thing happened with Abrahah too.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNufail bin Habib, whom they had brought as guide from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountry of Khatham, was searched out and asked to guide\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem back to Yaman, but he refused and said: \"Now where\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcan one flee when God pursues? The split nose (Abrahah)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the conquered; not the conqueror.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to Sayyidah Umme Hani and Sayyiduna Zubair bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Awwam, the Prophet (pbuh) said: \"The Qureysh did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworship anyone but Allah, the One and Only, for ten\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyears. The Arabs describe the year in which this event\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttook place as Am al-Feel (the year of the elephants), and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the same year the Prophet of Allah (pbuh) was born.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

It was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscattered throughout Hijaz until the time of Qusayy bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKilab, the ancestor of the Prophet (pbuh). First of all,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQusayy gathered his tribe in Makkah and the tribe was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\table to gain authority over the Ka'bah. On that very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbasis, Qusayy was called Mujammi (uniter, assembler) by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this people. This man, by his sagacity and wisdom, founded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta city state in Makkah and made excellent arrangements\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the welfare of the pilgrims coming from all over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia, with the result that the Qureysh were able to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgain great influence among the Arabian tribes and lands.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter Qusayy's death, the offices of the state of Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere divided between his sons, Abdi Manaf and Abd ad-Dar,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut of the two Abdi Manaf gained greater fame even during\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this father's lifetime and was held in high esteem\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthroughout Arabia. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdi Manaf had four sons; Hashim, Abdi Shams,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Muttalib, and Naufal. Of these, Hashim, father of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdul Muttalib and grandfather of the Prophet, first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconceived the idea to take part in the trade that passed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween the eastern countries, Syria and Egypt through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia. He also purchased the necessities of life for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabians so that the tribes living by the trade route\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbought these from them and the merchants living in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterior of the country were attracted to the market of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah. This was the time when the Sasanian kingdom of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIran had gained control over the international trade that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas carried out between the northern lands, the eastern\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountries and the Byzantine empire through the Persian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGulf. This boosted the trade activity on the trade route\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleading from southern Arabia to Syria and Egypt along the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRed Sea coast. As with the other Arabian caravans, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh took advantage of the fact that the tribes on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis route held them in high esteem because of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatus of being Keepers of the Ka'bah. They stood\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindebted to them for the great generosity with which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh treated them in the Hajj season. That is why the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh felt no fear that their caravans would be robbed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor harmed any where along the way. The tribes along the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tway did not even charge them the heavy transit taxes that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey demanded from the other caravans. Hashim, taking\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadvantage of this, prepared the trade scheme and made his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree brothers partners in it. Thus, Hashim obtained\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade privileges from the Ghassanide king of Syria, Abdi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tShams from the Negus, Al-Muttalib from the Yamanite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnobles and Naufal from the governments of Iraq and lran,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand their trade began to flourish. That is how the four\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrothers became famous as traders and began to be called\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAshab Al-Ilaf (generators of love and affection) on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccount of their friendly relations with the tribes and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstates of the surrounding lands.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBecause of their business relations with Syria, Egypt,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIraq, Iran, Yaman and Abyssinia, the Qureysh became the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost affluent tribe in Arabia and Makkah became the most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant commercial center of the Arabian peninsula.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnother great advantage that accrued from these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinternational relations was that the caravans brought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Iraq tile script which later was used for writing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown the Qur'an. No other Arabian tribe could boast of so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmany literate people as Qureysh. For these very reasons,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet (pbuh) said: \"The Qureysh are the leaders of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen.\" (Musnad Ahmed: Marwiyat Amr bin al-As). \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Qureysh were thus prospering and flourishing when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevent of Abrahah's invasion of Makkah took place. Had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbrahah succeeded in taking this Holy City and destroying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Ka'bah, the glory and renown of not only the Qureysh,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut of the Ka'bah itself, would have suffered a great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsetback. The belief of pre-Islamic Arabia that the House\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindeed was Allah's House, would have been shattered, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe high esteem in which the Qureysh were held for being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkeepers of the House throughout the country would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen tarnished. Then, after the Abyssinian advance to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah, the Byzantium also would have taken the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinitiative to gain control over the trade route between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSyria and Makkah. The Qureysh would have been reduced to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta plight worse than that in which they were involved\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore Qusayy bin Kilab. But when Allah showed this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanifestation of His power where swarms of birds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestroyed 60,000 Abyssinian troops brought by Abrahah by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpelting them with stones, from Makkah to Yaman they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinued falling and dying by the wayside. The faith of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Arabs that the Ka'bah indeed was Allah's House,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincreased manifold, and the glory and renown of Qureysh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas also enhanced considerably throughout the country.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow the Arabs were convinced that they were under Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecial favor. They, therefore, visited every part of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia fearlessly and passed through every land with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir trade caravans unharmed. No one would dare touch\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem with an evil intention. Not to speak of touching\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem, even if they had a non-Qureyshite under their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprotection, he too was allowed to pass unharmed. That is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhy in this Surah, the Qureysh are simply asked to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsider; \"When you yourselves acknowledge this House\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(i.e. The Ka'bah) to be Allah's House, and not of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tidols, and when you fully know that it is Allah Alone Who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas granted you peace by virtue of this House, made your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade and commerce flourish and favored you with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprosperity, you should then worship none but Him Alone!\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

The question is, what was the special trait of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe character of this person, which became the basis of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis condemnation by name? To understand this it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary that one understand the Arabian society of that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime and the role that Abu Lahab played in it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn ancient days there prevailed chaos, confusion,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbloodshed and plunder throughout Arabia. The condition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor centuries was that a person could have no guarantee\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the protection of life, honor and property except with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe help and support of his clansmen and blood relations.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, silah rehmi (good treatment of the kindred)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas esteemed most highly among the moral values of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabian society and the breaking off of connections with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkindred was regarded as a great sin. Under the influence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof this same Arabian tradition, the Prophet (pbuh) began\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto preach the message of Islam. The other clans of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQureysh and their chiefs resisted and opposed him tooth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand nail, but the Bani Hashim and the Bani Al-Muttalib\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(children of Al-Muttalib, brother of Hashim) not only did\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot oppose him but continued to support him openly, even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthough most of them had not yet believed in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood. The other clans of Qureysh regarded this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupport by the Prophet's blood relations as perfectly in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccordance with the moral traditions of Arabia. That is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhy they never taunted the Bani Hashim and the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Muttalib, even though they seemingly had abandoned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir ancestral faith by supporting a person who was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreaching a new faith. They knew and believed that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould in no case hand over an individual of their clan to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this enemies, and their support and aid of a clansman was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperfectly natural in the sight of the Qureysh and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of Arabia.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis moral principle, which the Arabs even in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpre-Islamic days of ignorance, regarded as worthy of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trespect and inviolable was broken only by one man in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenmity of Islam, and that was Abu Lahab, son of Abdul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuttalib, an uncle of the Prophet. In Arabia, an uncle\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepresented the father especially when the nephew was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfatherless. The uncle was expected to look after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnephew as one of his own children. But this man in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thostility to Islam and love of Kufr trampled over all of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Arab traditions with his actions.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBefore the proclamation of Prophethood, two of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's daughters were married to two of Abu Lahab's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsons, Utbah and Utaibah. When the Prophet began to invite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople to Islam, Abu Lahab said to both his sons: \"I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould forbid myself seeing and meeting you until you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivorce the daughters of Muhammad (pbuh).\" Both of them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubsequently divorced their wives. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhenever the Prophet went to preach the message of Islam,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis man followed him and forbade the people to listen to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim.

When a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade caravan came to Makkah and a besieged person from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tShi'b Abi Talib approached it to buy some food, Abu Lahab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshouted out to the merchants to demand a forbidding\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprice, telling them that he would make up for any loss\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they incurred. Thus, they would demand exorbitant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trates and the poor customer would return empty handed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this starving children. Then Abu Lahab would purchase the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame articles from them at the market rates. (Reported by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn S'ad, Ibn Hisham).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn account of these misdeeds this man was condemned in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah by name. It was against the established\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditions of Arabia that an uncle would oppose his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnephew without a reason or pelt stones and bring false\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccusations against him publicly. Therefore, people were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinfluenced by what Abu Lahab said and were in doubt about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet (pbuh). But when this Surah was revealed, Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLahab filled with rage started uttering nonsense, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople realized that what he said in opposition to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet was not at all reliable and was out of hostility\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto his nephew.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the Prophet's uncle was condemned by name, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople's expectations that the Messenger (pbuh) could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreat some relative leniently in the matter of religion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas frustrated forever. When the Prophet's own uncle was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken to task publicly. The people understood that there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas no room for preference or partiality in their faith.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA non-relative could become a near and dear one if he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieved, and a near relation a non-relative if he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelieved. Thus, there is no place for the ties of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblood in religion.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

The idolatrous polytheists were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworshipping gods made of wood, stone, gold, silver and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother substances. These gods had forms, shapes and bodies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the gods and goddesses were descended from each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother. No goddess was without a husband and no god\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout a wife. They stood in need of food and drink and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir devotees arranged these for them. A large number of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe polytheists believed that God assumed human form and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere were some people who descended from Him. Although\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Christians claimed to believe in One God, they also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieved that their God had at least a son, and that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFather, Son and the Ghost also had the honor of being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassociated with their Godhead to such an extent that God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad a mother and a mother-in-law as well. The Jews also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclaimed to believe in One God, but their God too was not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout physical, material or other human qualities and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharacteristics. He went for a stroll, appeared in human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tform, wrestled with a servant of His, and was father of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tson, Ezra. In addition to these religious communities,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Zoroastrians - fire worshippers and the Sabians -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstar worshippers, also existed. Under such conditions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen the people were invited to believe in Allah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOne, Who has no associate, it was inevitable that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestions arose in their minds as to what kind of God He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas, Who was the One and Only and Whose invitation to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve in Him was being given at the expense of all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother gods and deities. It is a miracle of the Qur'an,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat in a few brief words it answered all questions and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresented such a clear concept of the Being of Allah that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall polytheistic concepts were destroyed, leaving no room\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the ascription of human qualities to His Being.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThat is why the Prophet (pbuh) held this Surah in such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreat esteem. This made the Muslims realize its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportance in different ways and exhorted them to recite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit frequently and disseminate it among the people. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstates the foremost and fundamental doctrine of Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Tawhid) in four brief sentences, impresses on human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmemory and can be read and recited easily. There are a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreat number of Hadith which show that the Prophet, on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifferent occasions and in different ways, told the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople that this Surah is equivalent to one third of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an. Several ahadith on this subject have been related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Daud, Nasai, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMusnad Ahmed, Tabarani and other books. Commentators have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso given many explanations of the Prophet's saying. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbul A'la Maududi's opinion it simply means that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligion presented by the Qur'an is based on three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoctrines: Tawhid, Risalat and the Hereafter. This Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteaches Tawhid, pure and undefiled. Therefore, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (pbuh) regarded it as equal to one-third of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

As long as they had any hope that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be able to prevent him from preaching his message\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby throwing some temptation in his way, or striking some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbargain with him, their hostility did not become very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactive.
