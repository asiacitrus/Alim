As a matter of fact, we learn from authentic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTraditions that it was the first complete Surah which was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed to Muhammed (PBUH). Before this, only a few\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmiscellaneous verses were revealed which form parts of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Alaq, Muzzammil, Muddathir, etc.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah is in fact a prayer which Allah has taught to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall those who want to make a study of his book. It has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen placed at the very beginning of the book to teach\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis lesson to the reader: if you sincerely want to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbenefit from the Quran, you should offer this prayer to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Lord of the Universe.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis preface is meant to create a strong desire in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theart of the reader to seek guidance from the Lord of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUniverse, who alone can grant it. Thus Al-Fatiha\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindirectly teaches that the best thing for a man is to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpray for guidance to the straight path, to study the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran with the mental attitude of a seeker-after-truth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand to recognize the fact that the Lord of the Universe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the source of all knowledge. He should, therefore,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegin the study of the Quran with a prayer to him for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguidance.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFrom this theme, it becomes clear that the real relation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween Al-Fatiha and the Quran is not that of an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintroduction to a book but that of a prayer and its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanswer. Al-Fatiha is the prayer from the servant and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran is the answer from the the Master to his prayer.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe servant prays to Allah to show him guidance and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMaster places the whole of the Quran before him in answer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto his prayer, as if to say, \"This is the Guidance you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegged from Me.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

    "Text": "<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Name</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhy the name AL-BAQARAH? AL-BAQARAH (the Cow) has been so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnamed from the story of the Cow occurring in this Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(vv. <a href='qa:2.67'>67-73</a>). It has not, however, been used as a title to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindicate the subject of the Surah. It will, therefore, be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas wrong to translate the name Al-Baqarah into \"The Cow\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor \"The Heifer\" as to translate any English name, say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBaker, Rice, Wolf etc., into their equivalents in other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlanguages or vice versa, because this would imply that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Surah dealt with the subject of \"The Cow\". Many more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs of the Quran have been named in the same way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause no comprehensive words exist in Arabic (in spite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof its richness) to denote the wide scope of the subject\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscussed in them.

It begins with the answer to that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayer, \"This is the Book (that) . . . is guidance. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreater part of Al-Baqarah was revealed during the first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo years of the Holy Prophet's life at Al-Madinah. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsmaller part which was revealed at a later period has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen included in this Surah because its contents are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclosely related to those dealt with in this Surah. For\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance, the verses prohibiting interest were revealed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduring the last period of the Holy prophet's life but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been inserted in this Surah. For the same reason,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe last verses (<a href='qa:2.284'>284-286</a>) of this Surah which were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed at Makkah before the migration of the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet to Al-Madinah have also been included in it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Historical Background</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn order to understand the meaning of this Surah, we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould know its historical background:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAt Makkah the Quran generally addressed the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmushrik Quraish who were ignorant of Islam, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tat Al-Madinah it was also concerned with the Jews\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twho were acquainted with the creed of the Unity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah, Prophethood, Revelation, the Hereafter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand angels. They also professed to believe in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlaw which was revealed by Allah to their Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMoses (Allah's peace be upon him), and in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprinciple, their way was the same (Islam) that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twas being taught by Prophet Muhammad (Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace be upon him). But they had strayed away\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom it during the centuries of degeneration and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thad adopted many un-Islamic creeds, rites and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcustoms of which there was no mention and for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhich there was no sanction in the Torah. Not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tonly this: they had tampered with the Torah by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinserting their own explanations and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretations into its text. They had distorted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\teven that part of the Word of God which had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tremained intact in their Scriptures and taken out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof it the real spirit of true religion and were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnow clinging to a lifeless frame of rituals.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tConsequently their beliefs, their morals and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir conduct had gone to the lowest depths of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdegeneration. The pity is that they were not only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsatisfied with their condition but loved to cling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto it. Besides this, they had no intention or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinclination to accept any kind of reform. So they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbecame bitter enemies of those who came to teach\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthem the Right Way and did their worst to defeat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tevery such effort. Though they were originally\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims, they had swerved from the real Islam and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmade innovations and alterations in it and had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfallen victims to hair splitting and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsectarianism. They had forgotten and forsaken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah and begun to serve mammon. So much so that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthey had even given up their original name\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Muslim\" and adopted the name \"Jew\" instead, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmade religion the sole monopoly of the children\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof Israel. This was their religious condition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhen the Holy Prophet went to Al-Madinah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinvited the Jews to the true religion. That is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhy more than one third of this Surah has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taddressed to the children of Israel. A critical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treview of their history, their moral degeneration\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand their religious perversions has been made;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tside by side with this the high standard of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmorality and the fundamental principles of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpure religion have been put forward in order to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbring out clearly the nature of the degeneration\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof the community of a prophet when it goes astray\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand to draw clear lines of demarcation between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treal piety and formalism, and the essentials and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnon-essentials of the true religion.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAt Makkah Islam was mainly concerned with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpropagation of its fundamental principles and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmoral training of its followers. But after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmigration of the Holy Prophet to Al-Madinah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhere Muslims had come to settle from all over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia and where a tiny Islamic State had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tset up with the help of the Ansar (local\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsupporters), naturally the Quran had to turn its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tattention to the social, cultural, economic,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpolitical and legal problems as well. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccounts for the difference between the themes of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe surahs revealed at Makkah and those at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah. Accordingly about half of this Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdeals with those principles and regulations which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tare essential for the integration and solidarity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof a community and for the solution of its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tproblems.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter the migration to Al-Madinah, the struggle between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam and un-Islam had also entered a new phase. Before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis the Believers, who propagated Islam among their own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclans and tribes, had to face its opponents at their own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trisk. But the conditions had changed at Al-Madinah, where\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims from all parts of Arabia had come and settled as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone community, and had established an independent city\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate. Here it became a struggle for the survival of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCommunity itself, for the whole of non-Muslim Arabia was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbent upon and united in crushing it totally. Hence the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowing instructions, upon which depended not only its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuccess but its very survival, were revealed in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol type='A'>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Community should work with the utmost zeal to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpropagate its ideology and win over to its side\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe greatest possible number of people.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt should so expose its opponents as to leave no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\troom for doubt in the mind of any sensible person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they were adhering to an absolutely wrong\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tposition.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt should infuse in its members (the majority of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhom were homeless and indigent and surrounded on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tall sides by enemies) that courage and fortitude\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhich is so indispensable to their very existence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin the adverse circumstances in which they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tstruggling and to prepare them to face these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tboldly.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt should also keep them ready and prepared to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmeet any armed menace, which might come from any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tside to suppress and crush their ideology, and to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\toppose it tooth and nail without minding the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\toverwhelming numerical strength and the material\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tresources of its enemies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt should also create in them that courage which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tis needed for the eradication of evil ways and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the establishment of the Islamic Way instead.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat is why Allah has revealed in this Surah such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinstructions as may help achieve all the above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned objects.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt the time of the revelation of Al-Baqarah, all sorts of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites had begun to appear.

This Surah has been especially\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taddressed to two groups-the people of the Book (the Jews\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Christians) and the followers of Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Allah's peace be upon him).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe message has been extended to the Jews and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChristians in continuation of the invitation in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Baqarah, in which they have been admonished for their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\terroneous beliefs and evil morals and advised to accept,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas a remedy, the Truth of the Quran. They have been told\\n\\t\\t\\t\\there that Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) taught the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame right way of life that had been preached by their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\town Prophets; that it alone was the Right Way, the way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah; hence any deviation from it will be wrong even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to their own Scriptures.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe second group, the Muslims, who had been declared to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe the best Community in Al-Baqarah and appointed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttorch-bearers of the Truth and entrusted with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponsibility of reforming the world, have been given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadditional instructions in continuation of those given in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe preceding Surah. The Muslims have been warned to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlearn a lesson from the religious and moral degeneration\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the former communities and to refrain from treading in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir footsteps. Instructions have also been given about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe reformative work they had to perform. Besides this,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey have been taught how to deal with the people of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBook and the hypocrites who were putting different kinds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof hindrances in the way of Allah.

Though they had come\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tout victorious in the Battle of Badr, they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnot out of danger yet. Their victory had aroused\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe enmity of all those powers in Arabia which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twere opposed to the Islamic Movement. Signs of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthreatening storms had begun to appear on all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsides and the Muslims were in a perpetual state\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof fear and anxiety. It looked as if the whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArabian world around the tiny state of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah-which was no more than a village state\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tat that time-was bent upon blotting out its very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\texistence. This state of war was also adversely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taffecting its economy, which had already been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbadly disturbed by the influx of the Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trefugees from Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThen there was the disturbing problem of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJewish clans who lived in the suburbs of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah. They were discarding the treaties of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\talliance they had made with the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tafter his migration from Makkah. So much so that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ton the occasion of the Battle of Badr, these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of the Book syrnpathised with the evil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taims of the idolaters, in spite of the fact that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir fundamental articles of the Faith-Oneness\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah, Prophethood, Life-after- death-were the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsame as those of the Muslims. After the Battle of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBadr, they openly began to incite the Quraish and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tother Arab clans to wreak their vengeance on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims. Thus those Jewish clans set aside their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcenturies-old friendly and neighborly relations\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twith the people of Al-Madinah. At last when their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmischievous actions and breaches of treaties\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbecame unbearable, the Holy Prophet attacked the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBani-Qainu-qa'a, the most mischievous of all the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tother Jewish clans who had conspired with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites of Al-Madinah and the idolatrous Arab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tclans to encircle the Believers on all sides. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmagnitude of the peril might be judged from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfact that even the life of the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thimself was always in danger. Therefore his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions slept in their armors during that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod and kept watch at night to guard against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tany sudden attack, and whenever the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thappened to be out of sight even for a short\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhile, they would at once set out in search of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thim.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis incitement by the Jews added fuel to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfire which was burning in the hearts of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish and they began to make preparations to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tavenge the defeat they had suffered at Bad. A\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tyear after this an army of 3,000 strong marched\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tout of Makkah to invade Al-Madinah and a battle\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttook place at the foot of Mount Uhud. The Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet came out of Al-Madinah with one thousand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmen to meet the enemy. While they were marching\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto the battle-field, three hundred hypocrites\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdeserted the army and returned to Al-Madinah, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthere still remained a small band of hypocrites\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the seven hundred who accompanied the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet. They played their part and did their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tworst to create mischief and chaos in the ranks\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Believers during the Battle. This was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst clear indication of the fact that within\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fold of the Muslim Community there was quite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta large number of saboteurs who were always ready\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto conspire with the external enemies to harm\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir own brethren.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThough the devices of the hypocrites had played a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgreat part in the set-back at Uhud, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tweaknesses of the Muslims themselves contributed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tno less to it. And it was but natural that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims should show signs of moral weakness for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were a new community which had only recently\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen formed on a new ideology and had not as yet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgot a thorough moral training. Naturally in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsecond hard test of their physical and moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tstrength, some weaknesses came to the surface.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat is why a detailed review of the Battle of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tUhud was needed to warn the Muslims of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tshortcomings and to issue instructions for their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treform. It should also be noted that this review\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Battle is quite different from the reviews\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat are usually made by generals on similar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\toccasions.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Subject: Guidance</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah is the sequel to Al-Baqarah and the invitation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherein is continued to the people of the Book.

    "Text": "<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Period of Revelation</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah comprises several discourses which were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed on different occasions during the period ranging\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprobably between the end of A.H. 3 and the end of A.H. 4\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor the beginning of A.H. 5. Although it is difficult to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetermine the exact dates of their revelations, yet it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible to assign to them a fairly correct period with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe help of the Commandments and the events mentioned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherein and the Traditions concerning them. A few\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstances are given below by way of illustration.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe know that the instructions about the division\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof inheritance of the martyrs and for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsafeguard of the rights of the orphans were sent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdown after the Battle of Uhud in which 70 Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twere killed. Then naturally the question of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdivision of the inheritance of the martyrs and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe safeguard of the rights of their orphans\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tarose in many families at Al-Madinah. From this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twe conclude that <a href='qa:4.1'>vv. 1-28</a> were revealed on that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\toccasion.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe learn from the Traditions that the Commandment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tabout salat during war time was given on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\toccasion of Zat-ur-Riqa'a, an expedition which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttook place in A.H. 4. From this we conclude that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe discourse containing <a href='qa:4.102'>v. 102</a> was revealed on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat occasion.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe last warning (v. 47) to the Jews was given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the Banu Nadir were exiled from Al-Madinah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin Rabi'-ul Awwal, A.H. 4. From this it may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsafely be concluded that the discourse containing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tv. 47 must have been revealed some time before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat date.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe permission abouttayammum (the performance of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tablutions with pure dust, in case no water be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tavailable) was given during the Bani-al-Mustaliq\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\texpedition, which took place in A.H. 5. Therefore\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe probable period of the revelation of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscourse containing v. 43 was A.H. 5.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Topics and Their Background</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLet us now consider the social and historical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsiderations of the period in order to understand the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah. All the discourses in this Surah deal with three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmain problems which confronted the Holy Prophet at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime. First of all, he was engaged in bringing about an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall round development of the Islamic Community that had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen formed at the time of his migration to Al-Madinah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor this purpose he was introducing new moral, cultural,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsocial, economic and political ways in place of the old\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tones of the pre-Islamic period. The second thing that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccupied his attention and efforts was the bitter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstruggle that was going on with the mushrik Arabs, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJewish clans and the hypocrites who were opposing tooth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand nail his mission of reform. Above all he had to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpropagate Islam in the face of the bitter opposition of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese powers of evil with a view to capturing more and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore minds and hearts.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccordingly, detailed instructions have been given for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe consolidation and strengthening of the Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCommunity in continuation of those given in Al-Baqarah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPrinciples for the smooth running of family life have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen laid down and ways of settling family disputes have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen taught. Rules have been prescribed for marriage and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trights of wife and husband have been apportioned fairly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand equitably. The status of women in the society has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen determined and the declaration of the rights of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torphans has been made laws and regulations have been laid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown for the division of inheritance, and instructions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been given to reform economic affairs. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfoundation of the penal code has been laid down, drinking\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been prohibited, and instructions have been given for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcleanliness and purity. The Muslims have been taught the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkind of relations good men should have with their Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand fellow men. Instructions have been given for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaintenance of discipline in the Muslim Community.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe moral and religious condition of the people of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBook has been reviewed to teach lessons to the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand to forewarn them to refrain from following in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfootsteps. The conduct of the hypocrites has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcriticized and the distinctive features of hypocrisy and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrue faith have been clearly marked off to enable the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims to distinguish between the two. In order to cope\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the aftermath of the Battle of Uhud, inspiring\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscourses were sent down to urge the Muslims to face the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenemy bravely, for the defeat in the Battle had so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temboldened the mushrik Arab clans and the neighboring\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJews and the hypocrites at home that they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthreatening the Muslims on all sides. At this critical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjuncture, Allah filled the Muslims with courage and gave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem such instructions as were needed during that period\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof war clouds. In order to counteract the fearful rumors\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat were being spread by the hypocrites and the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof weak faith, they were asked to make a thorough inquiry\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto them and to inform the responsible people about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem. Then they were experiencing some difficulties in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffering their salat during the expeditions to some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplaces where no water was available for performing their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tablutions, etc. In such cases they were allowed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcleanse themselves with pure earth and to shorten the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsalat or to offer the \"Salat of Fear\", when they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaced with danger. Instructions were also given for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsolution of the puzzling problem of those Muslims!who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere scattered among the unbelieving Arab clans and were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toften involved in war. They were asked to migrate to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah, the abode of Islam.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah also deals with the case of Bani Nadir who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere showing a hostile and menacing attitude, in spite of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe peace treaties they had made with the Muslims. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere openly siding with the enemies of Islam and hatching\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplots against the Holy Prophet and the Muslim Community\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven at Al-Madinah itself. They were taken to task for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir inimical behavior and given a final warning to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchange their attitude, and were at last exiled from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah on account of their misconduct.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe problem of the hypocrites, who had become very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttroublesome at that time, was involving the Believers in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifficulties. Therefore they were divided into different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategories to enable the Muslims to deal with them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappropriately. Clear instructions were also given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregarding the attitude they should adopt towards the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnon-belligerent clans. The most important thing needed at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat time was to prepare the Muslims for the bitter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstruggle with the opponents of Islam. For this purpose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreatest importance was attached to their character\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbuilding, for it was obvious that the small Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCommunity could only come out successful, nay, survive,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif the Muslims possessed high moral character. They were,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore, enjoined to adopt the highest moral qualities\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand were severely criticized whenever any moral weakness\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas detected in them.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThough this Surah mainly deals with the moral and social\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treforms, yet due attention has been paid to propagation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Islam. On the one hand, the superiority of the Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmorality and culture has been established over that of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Jews, Christians and mushriks; on the other hand,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir wrong religious conceptions, their wrong morality\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand their evil acts have been criticized to prepare the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tground for inviting them to the way of the Truth.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Subject: Consolidation of the Islamic Community</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe main object of this Surah is to teach the Muslims the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tways that unite a people and make them firm and strong.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIntroductions for the stability of family, which is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnucleus of community have been given. Then they have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\turged to prepare themselves for defense. Side by side\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith these, they have been taught the importance of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpropagation of Islam. Above all, the importance of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thighest moral character in the scheme of consolidation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Community has been impressed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

    "Text": "<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Name</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah takes its name from verse 112 in which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tword Mai'dah occurs. Like the names of many other surahs,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis name has no special relation to the subject of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah but has been used merely as a symbol to distinguish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit from other surahs:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Period of Revelation</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe theme of this Surah indicates, and traditions support\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit, that it was revealed after the treaty of Hudaibiyah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat the end of 6 A.H. or in the beginning of 7 A.H. That\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis why it deals with those problems that arose from this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreaty.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Holy Prophet with 1400 Muslims went to Makkah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZil-Qaadah 6 A.H. to perform Umrah, but the Quraish,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspurred by their enmity, prevented him from its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformance, though it was utterly against all the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tancient religious traditions of Arabia. After a good deal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof hard and harsh negotiations, a treaty was concluded at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHudaibiyah according to which it was agreed that he could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperform Umrah the following year. That was a very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappropriate occasion for teaching the Muslims the right\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tway of performing a pilgrimage to Makkah with the true\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic dignity, and enjoining that they should not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevent the disbelievers from performing pilgrimage to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah as a retaliation for their misbehavior. This was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot difficult at all as many disbelievers had to pass\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough Muslim territory on their way to Makkah. This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhy the introductory verses deal with the things\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconnected with pilgrimage to Makkah and the same theme\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been resumed in vv. 101-104. The other topics of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah also appear to belong to the same period.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe continuity of the subject shows that most probably\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe whole of the surah was revealed as a single discourse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat one and the same time. It is also possible that some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof its verses were revealed at a later period and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinserted in this Surah at different places where they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfitted in. But there appears to be not the least gap\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanywhere in the surah to show that it might have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomprised two or more discourses. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Occasion of Revelation. </div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah was revealed to suit the requirements of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchanged conditions which were now different from those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevailing at the time of the revelation of Al-i-'Imran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand An-Nisa. Then the shock of the set-back at Uhud had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade the very surroundings of Al-Madinah dangerous for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims, but now Islam had become an invulnerable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpower and the Islamic State had extended to Najd on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teast, to the Red Sea on the west, to Syria on the north\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand to Makkah on the south. This set-back which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims had suffered at Uhud had not broken their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetermination. It had rather spurred them to action. As a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresult of their continuous struggle and unparalleled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrifices, the power of. the surrounding clans, within a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tradius of 200 miles or so, had been broken. The Jewish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmenace which was always threatening Al-Madinah had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttotally removed and the Jews in the other parts of Hijaz\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad become tributaries of the State of Al-Madinah. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlast effort of the Quraish to suppress Islam had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthwarted in the Battle of the Ditch. After this, it had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome quite obvious to the Arabs that no power could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuppress the Islamic movement. Now Islam was not merely a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreed which ruled over the minds and hearts of the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut had also become a State which dominated over every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taspect of the life of the people who lived within its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboundaries. This had enabled the Muslims to live their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlives without let or hindrance, in accordance with their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeliefs.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnother development had also taken place during this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod. The Muslim civilization had developed in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccordance with the principles of Islam and the Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tviewpoint. This civilization was quite distinct from all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother civilizations in all its details, and distinguished\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims clearly from the non Muslims in their moral,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsocial and cultural behavior. Mosques had been built in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall territories, prayer had been established and Imam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(leader) for every habitation and clan had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappointed. The Islamic civil and criminal laws had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformulated in detail and were being enforced through the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic courts. New and reformed ways of trade and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommerce had taken the place of the old ones. The Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlaws of marriage and divorce, of the segregation of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsexes, of the punishment for adultery and calumny and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike had cast the social life of the Muslims in a special\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmould. Their social behavior, their conversation, their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdress, their very mode of living, their culture etc., had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken a definite shape of its own. As a result of all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese changes, the non-Muslims could not expect that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims would ever return to their former fold. Before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe treaty of Hudaibiyah, the Muslims were so engaged in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir struggle with the non-Muslim Quraish that they got\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno time to propagate their message. This hindrance was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremoved by what was apparently a defeat but in reality a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvictory at Hudaibiyah. This gave the Muslims not only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace in their own territory but also respite to spread\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir message in the surrounding territories. Accordingly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet addressed letters to the rulers of Iran,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEgypt and the Roman Empire and the chiefs of Arabia,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinviting them to Islam. At the same time the missionaries\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Islam spread among the clans and tribes and invited\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem to accept the Divine Way of Allah. These were the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcircumstances at the time when Al-Ma'idah was revealed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Topics</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt deals with the following three main topics: \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCommandments and instructions about the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treligious, cultural and political life of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims. In this connection, a code of ceremonial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trules concerning the journey for Hajj has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprescribed; the observance of strict respect for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe emblems of Allah has been enjoined; and any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tkind of obstruction or interference with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpilgrims to the Kaabah has been prohibited.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDefinite rules and regulations have been laid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdown for what is lawful and unlawful in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter of food, and self-imposed foolish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trestrictions of the pre-Islamic age have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tabolished. Permission has been given to take food\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twith the people of the Book and to marry their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twomen.

Drinking\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand gambling have absolutely been made unlawful.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExpiation for the breaking of oath has been laid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdown and a few more things have been added to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlaw of evidence.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAdmonition to the Muslims. Now that the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thad become a ruling body, it was feared that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpower might corrupt them. At this period of great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttrial, Allah had admonished them over and over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tagain to stick to justice and to guard against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe wrong behavior of their predecessors, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of the Book. They have been enjoined to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tremain steadfast to the Covenant of obedience to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah and His Messenger, and to observe strictly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir commands and prohibitions in order to save\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthem- selves from the evil consequences which.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbefell the Jews and the Christians who had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tviolated them. They have been instructed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tobserve the dictates of the Holy Quran in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconduct of all their affairs and warned against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe attitude of hypocrisy.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAdmonition to the Jews and the Christians. As the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpower of the Jews had been totally weakened and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\talmost all their habitations in north Arabia had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcome under the rule of the Muslims, they have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen warned again about their wrong attitude and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinvited to follow the Right Way.

Asma, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdaughter of Yazid and a first cousin of Hadrat Mu'az-bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJahl, says, \"During the revelation of this Surah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet was riding on a she-camel and I was holding\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther nose-string. The she-camel began to feel the weight\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso heavily that it seemed as if her bones would break\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunder it.\" We also learn from other traditions that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet dictated the whole of the Surah the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnight that it was revealed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIts subject-matter clearly shows that it must have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed during the last year of the Holy Prophet's life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat Makkah. The tradition of Asma, daughter of Yazid, also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfirms this. As she belonged to the Ansar and embraced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam after the migration of the Holy Prophet to Yathrab,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther visit to the Holy Prophet at Makkah must have taken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplace during the last year of his life there. For before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis, his relations with those people were not so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintimate that a woman from there might have come to visit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim at Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Occasion of Revelation</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter determining the period of its revelation, it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teasier to visualize the background of the Surah. Twelve\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyears had passed since the Holy Prophet had been inviting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people to Islam. The antagonism and persecution by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quraish had become most savage and brutal, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmajority of the Muslims had to leave their homes and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmigrate to Habash (Abyssinia). Above all, the two great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupporters of the Holy Prophet, Abu Talib and Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhadijah, were no more to help and give strength to him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThus he was deprived of all the worldly support. But in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspite of this, he carried on his mission in the teeth of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topposition. As a result of this, on the one hand, all the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgood people of Makkah and the surrounding clans gradually\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegan to accept Islam; on the other hand, the community\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas a whole, was bent upon obduracy and rejection.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, if anyone showed any inclination towards\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam, he was subjected to taunts and derision, physical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tviolence and social boycott. It was in these dark\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcircumstances that a ray of hope gleamed from Yathrab,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhere Islam began to spread freely by the efforts of some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinfluential people of Aus and Khazraj, who had embraced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam at Makkah. This was a humble beginning in the march\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Islam towards success and none could foresee at that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime the great potentialities that lay hidden in it. For,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto a casual observer, it appeared at that time as if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam was merely a weak movement; it had no material\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbacking except the meager support of the Prophet's own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfamily and of the few poor adherents of the Movement.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tObviously the latter could not give much help because\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey themselves had been cast out by their own people who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad become their enemies and were persecuting them.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Topics</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese were the conditions, when this discourse was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed.

First of all, it should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnoted that comparatively very little material is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tavailable in regard to the background of the revelation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Makki Surahs whereas the period of the revelation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall the Madani Surahs is known or can be determined with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta little effort. There are authentic traditions even in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregard to the occasions of the revelation of the majority\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the verses. On the other hand, we do not have such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetailed information regarding the Makki Surahs. There\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare only a few Surahs and verses which have authentic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditions concerning the time and occasion of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation. This is because the history of the Makki\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod had not been compiled in such detail as that of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Madani period. Therefore we have to depend on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinternal evidence of these Surahs for determining the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod of their revelation: for example, the topics they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscuss, their subject. matter, their style and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdirect or indirect references to the events and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccasions of their revelation. Thus it is obvious that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the help of such evidence as this, we cannot say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith precision that such and such Surah or verse was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed on such and such an occasion. The most we can do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis to compare the internal evidence of a Surah with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevents of the life of the Holy Prophet at Makkah, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen come to a more or less correct conclusion as to what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticular stage a certain Surah belongs. If we keep the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove things in view, the history of the mission of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet at Makkah can be divided into four stages.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe first stage began with his appointment as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger and ended with the proclamation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood three years later. During this period\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Message was given secretly to some selected\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpersons only, but the common people of Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twere not aware of it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe second stage lasted for two years after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tproclamation of his Prophethood. It began with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\topposition by individuals: then by and by, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttook the shape of antagonism, ridicule,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tderision,, accusation, abuse, and false\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpropaganda then gangs were formed to persecute\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthose Muslims who were comparatively poor, weak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand helpless. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe third stage lasted for about six years from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe beginning of the persecution to the death of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Talib and Hadrat Khadijah in the tenth year\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof Prophethood. During this period, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpersecution of the Muslims became so savage and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbrutal that many of them were forced to migrate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto Habash. Social and economic boycott was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tapplied against the Holy Prophet and the members\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof his family, and those Muslims who continued to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tstay in Makkah were forced to take refuge in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tShi'b-i-A'bi Talib which was besieged.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe fourth stage lasted for about three years\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the tenth to the thirteenth year of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood. This was a period of hard trials and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgrievous sufferings for the Holy Prophet and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowers. Life had become unendurable at Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand there appeared to be no place of refuge even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\toutside it. So much so that when the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twent to Ta'if, it offered no shelter or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprotection. Besides this, on the occasion of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj, he would appeal to each and every Arab clan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto accept his invitation to Islam but met with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tblank refusal from every quarter. At the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttime, the people of Makkah were holding counsels\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto get rid of him by killing or imprisoning or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbanishing him from their city. It was at that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmost critical time that Allah opened for Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe hearts of the Ansar of Yathrab where he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmigrated at their invitation. Now that we have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdivided the life of the Holy Prophet at Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinto four stages, it has become easier for us to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttell, as far as possible, the particular stage in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhich a certain Makki Surah was revealed. This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause the Surahs belonging to a particular\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tstage can be distinguished from those of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tother stages with the help of their subject\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter and style. Besides this, they also contain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch references as throw light on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcircumstances and events that form the background\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof their revelation. In the succeeding Makki\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs, we will determine on the basis of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdistinctive features of each stage, and point out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin the Preface, the particular stage in which a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcertain Makki Surah was revealed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Subject :Islamic Creed.</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah mainly discusses the different aspects of the\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmajor articles of the Islamic Creed: Tawhid,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLife-after-death, Prophethood and their practical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapplication to human life.

This is because\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Messenger had spent a long time in admonishing the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of Makkah without any tangible effect on them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNay, they had turned a deaf ear to his message and become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso obdurate and antagonistic that, in accordance with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDivine Design, the Messenger was going to be commanded to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleave them and turn to other people. That is why they are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing admonished to accept the Message but, at the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime, they are being warned in strong terms of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequences that followed the wrong attitude of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformer people towards their Messengers.

During the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst decade or so of the Prophethood at Makkah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessage had proved its firmness, and stability. This was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe result of two things. First, the Messenger, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossessed the highest qualities of character, was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperforming his Mission with wisdom, foresight and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmagnanimity. He had shown by his conduct that he had made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tup his mind to carry the movement to a successful end\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand, therefore, was ready to face all sorts of dangers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand obstacles in the way. Secondly, the Message was so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharming that it attracted the minds and hearts of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople irresistibly towards itself. So much so that all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobstacles of ignorance, superstition and petty prejudices\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfailed to check its advance. That is why the Arab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupholders of the ways of \"ignorance,\" who looked down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon it in its initial stages, had begun to reckon it as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta serious menace during the last period of the stay of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet at Makkah, and were bent on crushing it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith all the force at their command. But in spite of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove-mentioned strength, the movement still lacked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcertain things to lead it to victory\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst, it had not yet been fully proved that it had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgathered round it a sufficient number of such followers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho not only believed in its truth, but also had such an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintense devotion to its principles that they were ready\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto expend all their energies and all that they possessed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the struggle for its success and establishment. So\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmuch so that they were ready to sacrifice their lives in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fight against the whole world itself even though they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be their own nearest relative. It is true that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowers of Islam had endured the severest persecutions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat the hands of the Quraish of Makkah and had given a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgood proof of the firmness of their faith and their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrong relation with Islam, yet further trials were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trequired to show that Islam had succeeded in acquiring\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch a band of followers which considered nothing dearer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan its ideal and was ready to sacrifice life for it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSecondly, though the voice of Islam had reached every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpart of the country, its effects were yet scattered and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits acquired strength was spread here and there: it had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot yet gathered sufficient force essential for a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecisive conflict with the old established order of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"ignorance\".\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThirdly, Islam had yet no home of its own and had not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablished itself firmly anywhere in the land where it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould consolidate its power and make it a base for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfurther action. For the Muslims were scattered all over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe country and were living among the unbelievers as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taliens whom their bloodthirsty enemies wanted to uproot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom their own homes.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFourthly, the Muslims had not yet had an opportunity to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemonstrate practically the blessings of the system of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife based on Islam. There was neither any Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tculture, nor any social, economic or political system;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnor were there any established principles of war and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace for their guidance. Therefore the Muslims had no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topportunity for demonstrating those moral principles on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich they intended to build their entire system of life;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnor had it been proved on the touchstone of trial that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims as a community were sincere in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproclamation of the Message. Allah created opportunities\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor making up these deficiencies. During the last four\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyears or so of the Prophet's stay at Makkah, the voice of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam had been proving effective at Yathrab and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople for various reasons had been accepting the message\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore readily than other clans of Arabia. So much so that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the twelfth year of Prophethood on the occasion of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj a deputation of 75 people met the Holy Prophet in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe darkness of night. These people not only accepted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam, but also offered to give him and his followers a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thome. As this was a most epoch making opportunity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovided by Allah, the Holy Prophet took advantage of it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe significance of this offer was quite clear to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of Yathrab, and they fully realized that this was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot an invitation to a mere fugitive, but to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah so that he should become their leader\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand ruler. Likewise they knew that they were not inviting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslim refugees to give them shelter from persecution\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut to assemble them from all over the country for their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintegration with themselves to form an organized\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommunity. Thus the offer of the people of Yathrab was to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake Yathrab the \"City of Islam.\" Accordingly the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet accepted their invitation and made it the first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"City of Islam\" in Arabia. And the people of Yathrab were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfully aware of the implications of this offer. It was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindeed a declaration of war against the whole of Arabia,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand an invitation to their own social and economic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboycott as well. And when the Ansar from Yathrab declared\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir allegiance to the Holy Prophet at Aqabah, they knew\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfully well its consequences. During the course of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformal declaration of allegiance, Asad-bin- Zurarah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyoungest of all the delegates from Yathrab, stood up and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"O people of Yathrab! Just listen to me and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsider the matter carefully in all its aspects. Though\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twe have come to him, regarding him only as a Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, we should know that we shall be inviting the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenmity of the whole of Arabia. For when we take him away\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Yathrab, we shall be attacked and our children may be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tput to the sword. Therefore if you have the courage in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour hearts to face it, then and then only, you should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeclare your allegiance to him and Allah will give you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits reward. But if you love your lives more than him and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Message, then leave this matter and frankly excuse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyourselves, for at this time Allah may accept your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcuses.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbbas bin Ubadah bin Naalah, another member of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdelegation, reiterated the same thing, saying, Do you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstand the implication of the declaration of your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallegiance to this person?\" (Voices, \"Yes, we know it.\")\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"You are challenging the whole world to war by your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeclaration of allegiance to him. There is every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlikelihood of a serious menace to your lives and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperties. Therefore consider it well. If you have any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tidea lurking in your minds that you will then hand him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover to his enemies, it is much better to leave him alone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnow, because that conduct shall bring shame and disgrace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto you in this world and the next. On the other hand, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou have sincerely resolved that you will endure all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkinds of consequences that will follow as a result of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis invitation, then it would be the best thing to take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe oath of allegiance to him because, by God, this will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurely bring good to you in this world as well as in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnext world.\" At this all the members of the delegation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcried with one voice, \"We are ready and prepared to risk\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall our wealth and our noble kith and kin for his sake.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt was then that the famous oath of allegiance, which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknown as the \"Second Oath of Allegiance at Aqabah\" was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the other side, the people of Makkah also understood\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfully well the implications of this matter from their own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoint of view. They realized that Muhammad (Allah's peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe upon him), who, they knew well, had a great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonality and possessed extraordinary abilities, was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoing to gain a strong footing, by this allegiance. For\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis would help integrate his followers, whose constancy,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetermination, and unwavering fidelity to the Messenger\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad been tried, into a disciplined community under his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twise leadership and guidance. And they knew that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould spell death for their old ways of life. They also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealized the strategic importance of Al-Madinah to their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade, which was their chief means of livelihood. Its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeographical position was such that the Muslims could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrike with advantage at the caravans traveling on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade route between Yaman and Syria, and thus strike at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe root of their economy and that of other pagan clans\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvery effectively. The value of the trade done by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of Makkah alone on this route, not to count that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof raif and other places, amounted to about two hundred\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthousand dinars annually. As the Quraish were fully aware\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the implications of the oath of allegiance at Aqabah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were greatly perturbed when they got wind of it the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame night. At first they tried to win over the people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah to their side. But when they saw that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims were migrating to Al- Madinah in small groups,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey realized that the Holy Prophet was also going to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temigrate soon from there. Then they decided to adopt an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textreme measure to prevent this danger. A few days before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this migration, the Quraish held a council to consider the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter. After a good deal of argument; they decided that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone person should be taken from each of the families of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish other than that of Banu Hashim to put an end to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe life of the Holy Prophet. This was to make it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifficult for the family of the Holy Prophet to fight\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talone with all the other families of the Quraish and thus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto force them to accept blood-money for his murder\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstead of taking revenge from them, but by the grace of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah their plot against the life of the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfailed because of his admirable foresight and full trust\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Allah, and he reached Al-Madinah safe and sound. When\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey could not prevent his emigration, it occurred to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem to exploit Abdullah bin Ub who had begun to cherish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta grievance against the Holy Prophet since his arrival at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah. He was an influential chief of Al-Madinah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people had agreed to make him their king. But when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe majority of Aus and Khazraj clan became Muslims and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacknowledged the Holy Prophet as their leader, guide and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\truler, all his hopes of becoming a king came to an end.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore the Quraish wrote to him, \"As you have given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshelter to our enemy, we tell you plainly that you should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teither fight with him yourself or exile him from your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcity otherwise we swear by God that we will invade your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcity, kill your males and make your females our slave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgirls.\" This letter added fuel to the flames of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjealousy and he was inclined to do some mischief, but the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet took timely precautions and defeated his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevil designs. The Quraish got another opportunity to hold\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout a threat. When Sa'ad bin Mu'az, another chief of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah, went to Makkah to perform Umrah, Abu Jahl\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterrupted him at the very door of the Kaabah, saying,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Do you think we will let you perform Umrah in peace when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou give shelter and help to renegades from us? Had you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot been a guest of Ummayyah bin Khalf, you would not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave gone alive from here.\" Sa'ad replied, \"By Allah, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou prevent me from this, I will retaliate in a worse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanner and block your route near Al-Madinah.\" This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident virtually led to a declaration from the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Makkah that they would prevent the Muslims from a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpilgrimage to the Kaabah, and from the people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah that as a retaliation they would block their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade route to Syria \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst the opponents of Islam. As a matter of fact there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas no other alternative for the Muslims than to keep a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrong hold on this route so as to force the Quraish, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe other clans, whose interests were vitally bound with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis route, to reconsider their inimical and antagonistic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattitude towards them. That is why the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattached the greatest importance to this problem. As soon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas he was free from making the preliminary arrangements\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor organizing the newly formed Muslim Community and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettling peace terms with the neighboring Jewish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thabitations, he adopted two measures in this connection\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst, he entered into negotiations with those clans who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlived between the Red Sea and this route so as to make\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talliances with them or at east to persuade them to make\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreaties of neutrality with the Muslims. He was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuccessful in this, and he entered into a treaty of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnon-alignment with Juhainah, which was a very important\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclan of the hilly tract near the sea coast. Then, at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tend of the first year of Hijrah, he made a treaty of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefensive alliance with Bani Damrah, who lived near\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYanb'u and Zawal Ushairah. In 2 A. H. Bani Mudlij also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjoined the alliance, as they were the neighbours and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallies of Bani Damrah. Then it so happened that quite a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlarge number of these people were converted to Islam as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresult of the missionary work done by the Muslims.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSecondly, he successively sent small bands of his men on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis route to serve as a warning to the Quraish, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself accompanied some of them. In the first year of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHijrah, four expeditions were sent there, that is, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpedition under Hamzah, the expedition under Ubaidah bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHarith, the expedition under Sa'ad bin Abi Waqqas and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Abwa' expedition under the Holy Prophet himself. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe first month of the second year two more incursions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere made on the same route. These are known as Buwat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tExpedition and Zawal Ushairah Expedition. Two things\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout all these expeditions are noteworthy. First, no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblood was shed and no caravans were plundered in any of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese expeditions. This proves that the real object of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese expeditions was to show to the Quraish which way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe wind was blowing. Secondly, not a single man from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of Al-Madinah was sent by the Holy Prophet on any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof these incursions. All the bands consisted purely of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe immigrants from Makkah so that the conflict should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremain between the people of the Quraish themselves and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould not further spread by the involvement of other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclans. On the other side, the Quraish of Makkah tried to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvolve others also in the conflict. When they sent bands\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttowards Al-Madinah, they did not hesitate to plunder the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople. For instance, an expedition under the leadership\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Kurz bin Jabir al-Fihrl plundered the cattle of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of Al-Madinah from the very vicinity of the city\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto show what their real intentions were.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis was the state of affairs when, in Sha'aban, 2 A.H.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(February or March, 623 A.D.) a big trade caravan of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish, carrying goods worth $50,000 or so, with only a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguard of thirty to forty men, on its way back from Syria\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Makkah, reached the territory from where it could be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teasily attacked from Al-Madinah. As the caravan was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcarrying trade goods worth thousands of pounds, and was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscantily guarded, naturally Abu Sufyan, who was in charge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof it, from his past experience feared an attach from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims. Accordingly, as soon as he entered the dangerous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterritory, he despatched a camel rider to Makkah with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrantic appeal for help. When the rider reached Makkah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the, following an old custom of Arabia, tore open the ears\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his camel, cut open his nose and overturned the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaddle. Then rending his shirt from front and behind, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegan to cry aloud at the top of his voice, \"O people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish despatch help to protect your caravan from Syria\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunder the charge of Abu Sufyan, for Muhammad with his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowers is in pursuit of it; otherwise I don't think\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou will ever get your goods. Run, run for help.\" This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaused great excitement and anger in the whole of Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand all the big chiefs of the Quraish got ready for war.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn army, consisting of 600 armored soldiers and cavalry\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof 100 riders with great pomp and show marched out for a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfight. They intended not only to rescue the caravan but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso to put to an end, once for all, the new menace from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims who had consolidated themselves at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah. They wanted to crush that rising power and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toverawe the clans surrounding the route so as to make it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsolutely secure for future trade. Now the Holy Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho always kept himself well informed of the state of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffairs, felt that the decisive hour has come and that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas the right time when he must take a bold step;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\totherwise the Islamic Movement would become lifeless for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tever and no chance would be left for it to rise again.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor if the Quraish invaded Al-Madinah, the odds would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst the Muslims. The condition of the Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCommunity was still very shaky because the immigrants\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhajirin had not been able to stabilize their economy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduring the short period (less than two years) of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstay at Al-Madinah; their helpers, the Ansar had not yet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen tried; and the neighbouring Jewish clans were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tantagonistic. Then there was a strong group of hypocrites\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand mushriks in Al-Madinah itself; above all, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurrounding clans lived in awe of the Quraish and had all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir religious sympathies with them. The Holy Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore, felt that the consequences of this possible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvasion would not be favorable to the Muslims. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecond possibility was that they would not invade\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah but try only to escort their caravan safely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand securely by a mere show of force. In that case, too,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif the Muslims remained inactive, it would affect their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treputation adversely. Obviously, this weak stand in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconflict would embolden the other Arabs also and make the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tposition of the Muslims very insecure in the country and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe surrounding clans would, at the instance of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish, start hostilities against them, and the Jews,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe hypocrites and the mushriks of Al- Madinah would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topenly rise against them and not only endanger their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecurity of life, property and honor but make it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifficult for them even to live there. The Muslims would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot be able to inspire the enemy with awe so as to keep\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsafe from them their life, property and honor. A careful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstudy of the situation led the Holy Prophet to make up\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this mind to take a decisive step and go into the battle\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith whatever little strength he could muster, for thus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand thus only could he show whether the Muslim Community\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad the right to survive or was doomed to perish.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen he arrived at this momentous decision, he called the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhajirin and the Ansar together and placed the whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tposition before them, without any reservation. He said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Allah has promised that you will confront one of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo, the trade caravan coming from the north or the army\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Quraish marching from the south. Now tell me which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the two you want to attack!\" A large majority of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople replied that they wanted to attack the caravan.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut the Holy Prophet who had something else before him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepeated the same question. At this Miqdad bin 'Amr, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhajir, stood up and said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Please\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarch to the side to which your Lord commands you; we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill accompany you wherever you go. We will not say like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Israelites, 'Go and let you and your Lord fight we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill wait'. In contrast to them we say, 'Let you and your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLord fight; we will fight by your side to our last\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreath'.\" Even then he did not announce any decision but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twaited for a reply from the Ansar who had not yet taken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany part in any battle of Islam. As this was the first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topportunity for them to prove that they were ready to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfulfill their promise of fighting for the cause of Islam,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the repeated the question without directly addressing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem. At this, Sa'ad bin Mu'az, an Ansar, stood up and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"Sir, it appears that you are putting the question\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto us.\" When the Holy Prophet said, \"Yes\", the Ansar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied, \"We have believed in you and confirmed that what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou have brought is the Truth, and have made a solemn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpledge with you that we will listen to you and obey you.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, O Messenger of Allah, do whatever you intend\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto do. We swear by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat we are ready to accompany you to the sea shore and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif you enter it, we will plunge into it. We assure you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat not a single one of us will remain behind or forsake\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou, for we will not hesitate at all to go to fight, even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif you should lead us to the battlefield tomorrow. We\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill remain steadfast in the battle and sacrifice our\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlives in the fight. We do hope that by the grace of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tour behavior will gladden your heart. So, trusting in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's blessing, take us to the battlefield.\" After\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese speeches it was decided that they should march\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttowards the army of the Quraish and not towards the trade\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaravan. But it should be noted that the decision was of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan ordinary nature. For the number of people, who came\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforward to go to the battlefield, was only a little more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan three hundred (86 Muhajirs, 62 from Aus and 170 from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhazraj). Then the little army was ill-armed and hardly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tequipped for battle. Only a couple of them had horses to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tride and the others had to take their turn in threes and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfours on the back of a camel, out of the 70 they had in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall. Above all, they had not got enough weapons for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbattle; only 60 of them had armors. It is, therefore, no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twonder that with the exception of those who were prepared\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto sacrifice their lives for the cause of Islam, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmajority of those who had joined the expedition, were so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfilled with fear that they felt as if they were knowingly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoing into the jaws of death. Then there were people who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talways looked at things from a selfish point of view.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThough they had embraced Islam, they did not realize that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir faith would demand the sacrifice of their lives and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperties from them; they were of the opinion that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas a mad expedition prompted by irrational enthusiasm\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor religion. But the Holy Prophet and the true Believers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad realized the urgency of that critical hour which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trequired the risk of life: therefore they marched\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstraight to the south-west, wherefrom the army of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish was coming. This is a clear proof of the fact\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat from the very beginning they had gone out to fight\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the army and not to plunder the caravan. For if they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad aimed at plundering the caravan they would have taken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe north-westerly direction and not the south-westerly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe two parties met in combat at Badr on the seventeenth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Ramadan. When the two armies confronted each other and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet noticed that the Quraish army\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toutnumbered the Muslims by three to one and was much\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetter equipped, he raised his hands up in supplication\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand made this earnest prayer with great humility: \"O\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah! Here are the Quraish proud of their war material:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey have come to prove that Thy Messenger is false. O\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah! now send that succor that Thou hast promised to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgive me. O Allah! If this little army of Thy servants is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestroyed, then there will be left none in the land to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworship Thee.\" In this combat the emigrants from Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere put to the hardest test for they had to fight\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst their own near and dear relatives and put to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsword their fathers, their sons, their paternal and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaternal uncles and their brothers. It is obvious that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly such people could have come out successful in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thardest of tests as had accepted the Truth sincerely and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcut off all relations with falsehood. And in another way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe test to which the Ansar were put was not less hard.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSo far they had only alienated the powerful Quraish and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir allies by giving shelter to the Muslims against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir wishes but now, for the first time, they were going\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto give fight to them and to sow the seeds of a long and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbitter war with them. This was indeed a very hard test\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor it meant that a small town with a population of a few\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthousand inhabitants was going to wage a war with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole of Arabia. It is obvious that only such people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould take this bold step who believed in the Truth of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam so firmly that they were ready to sacrifice every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonal interest for its sake. So Allah accepted the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tself-sacrifices of the Muhajirin and the Ansar because of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir true faith, and rewarded them with His succor. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproud, well-armed Quraish were routed by these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\till-equipped devotees of Islam. Seventy men of their army\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere killed and seventy captured as prisoners and their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarms and equipment came into the hands of the Muslims as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspoils of war. All their big chiefs, who were their best\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsoldiers and who had led the opposition to Islam, were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkilled in this Battle. No wonder that this decisive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvictory made Islam a power to be reckoned with. A Western\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresearch scholar says that before the Battle of Badr,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam was merely a religion and a state but after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBattle it became the state religion, nay, the state\\n\\t\\t\\t\\titself.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Topics of Discussion</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is this great Battle that has been reviewed in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah. But let it be noted that in some respects this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treview is quite different from the reviews that are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tusually made by the worldly commanders after a great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvictory. Instead of gloating over the victory, the moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tweaknesses that had come to the surface in that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpedition have been pointed out so that the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould try their best to reform themselves.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt has been impressed upon them that the victory was due\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the succor of Allah rather than to their own valor and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbravery so that the Muslims should learn to rely on Him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand obey Allah and His Messenger alone. The moral lesson\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the conflict between the Truth and falsehood has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenunciated and the qualities which lead to success in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconflict have been explained. Then the Surah addresses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mushriks, the hypocrites, the Jews and the prisoners\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof this war in a very impressive manner that should teach\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem a good lesson. It also gives instructions in regard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the spoils of war. The Muslims have bean told not to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregard these as their right but as a bounty from Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore they should accept with gratitude the share\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat is granted to them out of it and willingly accede to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe share which Allah sets apart for His cause and for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe help of the needy.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen it also gives normal instructions concerning the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlaws of peace and war for these were urgently needed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe explained at the stage which the Islamic Movement had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentered. It enjoined that the Muslims should refrain from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tways of \"ignorance\" in peace and war and thus should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablish their moral superiority in the world. It also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeant, to demonstrate to the world in actual practical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife the morality which it had been preaching to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld from the very beginning of Islam and had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoining that practical life should be based on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame. It also states some articles of the Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConstitution which help differentiate the status of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims living within the limits of Dar-ul-Islam (the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbode of Islam) from that of the Muslims living beyond\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits limits.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

It is called AT-TAUBAH because it enunciates\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe nature of taubah (repentance) and mentions the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions of its acceptance.(vv. 102. 118).

The first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscourse (vv. 1-37), was revealed in Zil-Qa'adah A.H. 9\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor thereabouts. As the importance of the subject of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscourse required its declaration on the occasion of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj the Holy Prophet despatched Hadrat Ali to follow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Abu Bakr, who had already left for Makkah as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleader of the Pilgrims to the Kaabah. He instructed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Ali to deliver the discourse before the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepresentatives of the different clans of Arabia so as to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinform them of the new policy towards the mushriks.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe second discourse (vv., 38-72) was sent down in Rajab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA.H. 9 or a little before this, when the Holy Prophet was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tengaged in making preparations for the Campaign of Tabuk.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this discourse, the Believers were urged to take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactive part in jihad, and the shirkers were severely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trebuked for holding back their wealth and for hesitation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto sacrifice their lives in the way of Allah because of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir hypocrisy, weak faith or negligence.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe third discourse (vv. 73-I 29) was revealed on his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn from the Campaign of Tabuk. There are some pieces\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin this discourse that were sent down on different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccasions during the same period and were afterwards\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsolidated by the Holy Prophet into the Surah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccordance with inspiration from Allah. But this caused\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno interruption in its continuity because they dealt with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same subject and formed part of the same series of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevents. This discourse warns the hypocrites of their evil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeeds and rebukes those Believers who had stayed behind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the Campaign of Tabuk. Then after taking them to task,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah pardons those true Believers who had not taken part\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the Jihad in the Way of Allah for one reason or the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother. Chronologically, the first discourse should have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcome last; but being the most important of the three in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregard to its subject-matter, it was placed first in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torder of compilation.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Historical Background</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow let us consider the historical background of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah. The series of events that have been discussed in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah took place after the Peace Treaty of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHudaibiyah. By that time, one-third of Arabia had come\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunder the sway of Islam which had established itself as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpowerful, well organized and civilized Islamic State.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Treaty afforded further opportunities to Islam to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspread its influence in the comparatively peaceful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tatmosphere created by it. After this Treaty, two events\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttook place, which led to very important results:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Conquest of Arabia</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe first was the Conquest of Arabia. The Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas able to send missions among different clans for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpropagation of Islam. The result was that during the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshort period of two years, it became such a great power\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it made the old order of ignorance feel helpless\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore it. So much so that the zealous elements from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the Quraish were so exasperated that they broke the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTreaty in order to encounter Islam in a decisive combat.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut the Holy Prophet took prompt action after the breach\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso as not to allow them any opportunity to gather enough\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforce for this. He made a sudden invasion on Makkah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe month of Ramadan in A H. 8 and conquered it. Though\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis conquest broke the backbone of the order of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tignorance, it made still another attack on Islam in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbattlefield of Hunain, which proved to be its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath-knell. The clans of Hawazin Thaqif, Naur, Jushm and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers gathered their entire forces in the battlefield in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torder to crush the reformative Revolution, but they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tutterly failed in their evil designs. The defeat of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'ignorance' at Hunain paved the way for making the whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Arabia the 'Abode of Islam' (Dar-ul-Islam). The result\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas that hardly a year had passed after the Battle of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHunain, when the major portion of Arabia came within the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfold of Islam and only a few upholders of the old order\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremained scattered over some corners of the country.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe second event that contributed towards making Islam a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformidable power was the Campaign of Tabuk, which was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessitated by the provocative activities of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChristians living within or near the boundaries of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRoman Empire to the north of Arabia. Accordingly, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet, with an army of thirty thousand marched\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboldly towards the Roman Empire but the Romans evaded the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tencounter. The result was that the power of the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet and Islam increased manifold and deputation from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall corners of Arabia began to wait upon him on his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn from Tabuk in order to offer their allegiance to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam and obedience to him. The Holy Quran has described\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis triumph in Surah An-Nisa: \"When the succor of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame and victory was attained and you saw people entering\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fold of Islam in large numbers...\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Campaign to Tabuk</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Campaign to Tabuk was the result of conflict with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRoman Empire, that had started even before the conquest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Makkah. One of the missions sent after the Treaty of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHudaibiyah to different parts of Arabia visited the clans\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich lived in the northern areas adjacent to Syria. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmajority of these people were Christians, who were under\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe influence of the Roman Empire. Contrary to all the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprinciples of the commonly accepted international law,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey killed fifteen members of the delegation near a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplace known as Zat-u-Talah (or Zat-i-Itlah). Only Ka'ab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Umair Ghifari, the head of the delegation, succeeded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin escaping and reporting the sad incident. Besides this,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tShurahbil bin Amr, the Christian governor of Busra, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas directly under the Roman Caesar, had also put to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath Haritli bin Umair, the ambassador of the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, who had been sent to him on a similar minion.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese events convinced the Holy Prophet that a strong\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taction should be taken in order to make the territory\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadjacent to the Roman Empire safe and secure for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims. Accordingly, in the month of Jamadi-ul-Ula A.H.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t8, he sent an army of three thousand towards the Syrian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tborder. When this army reached near Ma'an, the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlearnt that Shurahbil was marching with an army of one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thundred thousand to fight with them and that the Caesar,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho himself was at Hims, had sent another army consisting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof one hundred thousand soldiers under his brother\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTheodore. But in spite of such fearful news, the brave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsmall band of the Muslims marched on fearlessly and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tencountered the big army of Shurahbil at M'utah. And the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresult of the encounter in which the Muslims were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfighting against fearful odds (the ratio of the two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarmies was 1:33), was very favorable, for the enemy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tutterly failed to defeat them. This proved very helpful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the propagation of Islam. As a result, those Arabs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho were living in a state of semidependence in Syria and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnear Syria and the clans of Najd near Iraq, who were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunder the influence of the Iranian Empire, turned towards\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam and embraced it in thousands. For example, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of Bani Sulaim (whose chief was Abbas bin Mirdas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSulaimi), Ashja'a, Ghatafan, Zubyan, Fazarah, etc., came\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto the fold of Islam at the same time. Above all,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFarvah bin 'Amral Juzami, who was the commander of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArab armies of the Roman Empire, embraced Islam during\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat time, and underwent the trial of his Faith in a way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat filled the whole territory with wonder. When the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCaesar came to know that Farvah had embraced Islam, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tordered that he should be arrested and brought to his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcourt. Then the Caesar said to him, \"You will have to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchoose one of the two things. Either give up your Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand win your liberty and your former rank, or remain a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim and face death.\" He calmly chose Islam and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrificed his life in the way of the Truth.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNo wonder that such events as these made the Caesar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealize the nature of the danger that was threatening his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmpire from Arabia. Accordingly, in 9 A.H. he began to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake military preparations to avenge the insult he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuffered at M'utah. The Ghassanid and other Arab chiefs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso began to muster armies under him. When the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, who always kept himself well-informed even of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe minuet things that could affect the Islamic Movement\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfavorably or adversely, came to know of these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreparations, he at once understood their meaning.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, without the least hesitation he decided to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfight against the great power of the Caesar. He knew that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe show of the slightest weakness would result in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tutter failure of the Movement which was facing three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreat dangers at that time. First the dying power of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'ignorance' that had almost been crushed in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbattlefield of Hunain might revive again. Secondly, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHypocrites of Al-Madinah, who were always on the look-out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor such an opportunity, might make full use of this to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo the greatest possible harm to it. For they had already\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade preparations for this and had, through a monk called\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Amir, sent secret messages of their evil designs to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Christian king of Ghassan and the Caesar himself.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBesides this, they had also built a mosque near\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah for holding secret meetings for this purpose.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe third danger was of an attack by the Caesar himself,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho had already defeated Iran, the other great power of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat period, and filled with awe the adjacent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterritories. It is obvious that if all these three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telements had been given an opportunity of taking a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerted action against the Muslims, Islam would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlost the fight it had almost won. That is why in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcase the Holy Prophet made an open declaration for making\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreparations for the Campaign against the Roman Empire,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich was one of the two greatest empires of the world of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat period. The declaration was made though all the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapparent circumstances were against such a decision: for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere was famine in the country and the long awaited\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcrops were about to ripen: the burning heat of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscorching summer season of Arabia was at its height and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere was not enough money for preparations in general,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand for equipment and conveyance in particular. But in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspite of these handicaps, when the Messenger of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealized the urgency of the occasion, he took this step\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich was to decide whether the Mission of the Truth was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoing to survive or perish. The very fact that he made an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topen declaration for making preparations for such a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcampaign to Syria against the Roman Empire showed how\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant it was, for this was contrary to his previous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice. Usually he took every precaution not to reveal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeforehand the direction to which he was going nor the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tname of the enemy whom he was going to attack; nay, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid not move out of Al-Madinah even in the direction of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe campaign.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAll the parties in Arabia fully realized the grave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequences of this critical decision. The remnants of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe lovers of the old order of 'ignorance' were anxiously\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twaiting for the result of the Campaign, for they had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpinned all their hopes on the defeat of Islam by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRomans. The 'hypocrites' also considered it to be their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlast chance of crushing the power of Islam by internal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trebellion, if the Muslims suffered a defeat in Syria.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey had, therefore, made full use of the Mosque built by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem for hatching plots and had employed all their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdevices to render the Campaign a failure. On the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tside, the true Believers also realized fully that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfate of the Movement for which they had been exerting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir utmost for the last 22 years was now hanging in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbalance. If they showed courage on that critical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccasion, the doors of the whole outer world would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrown open for the Movement to spread. But if they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshowed weakness or cowardice, then all the work they had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdone in Arabia would end in smoke. That is why these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlovers of Islam began to make enthusiastic preparations\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the Campaign. Everyone of them tried to surpass the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother in making contributions for the provision of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tequipment for it. Hadrat Uthman and Hadrat Abdur Rehman\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Auf presented large sums of money for this purpose.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Umar contributed half of the earnings of his life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Hadrat Abu Bakr the entire earnings of his life. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindigent Companions did not lag behind and presented\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhatever they could earn by the sweat of their labor and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe women parted with their ornaments. Thousands of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvolunteers, who were filled with the desire of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrificing their lives for Islam, came to the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet and requested that arrangements for weapons and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconveyance be made for them so that they should join the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpedition. Those who could not be provided with these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshed tears of sorrow; the scene was so pathetic that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade the Holy Prophet sad because of his inability to arm\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem. In short, the occasion became the touchstone for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscriminating a true believer from a hypocrite. For, to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlag behind in the Campaign meant that the very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelationship of a person to Islam was doubtful.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccordingly, whenever a person lagged behind during the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjourney to Tabuk, the Holy Prophet, on being informed,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould spontaneously say, \"Leave him alone. If there be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany good in him, Allah will again join him with you, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif there be no good in him, then thank Allah that He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelieved you of his evil company\".\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn short, the Holy Prophet marched out towards Syria in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRajab A.H. 9, with thirty thousand fighters for the cause\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Islam. The conditions in which the expedition was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tundertaken may be judged from the fact that the number of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcamels with them was so small that many of them were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobliged to walk on foot and to wait for their turns for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseveral had to ride at a time on each camel. To add to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis, there was the burning heat of the desert and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacute shortage of water. But they were richly rewarded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor their firm resolve and sincere adherence to the cause\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand for their perseverance in the face of those great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifficulties and obstacles.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen they arrived at Tabuk, they learnt that the Caesar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand his allies had withdrawn their troops from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrontier and there was no enemy to fight with. Thus they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twon a moral victory that increased their prestige\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanifold and, that too, without shedding a drop of blood.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this connection, it is pertinent to point out that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeneral impression given by the historians of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcampaigns of the Holy Prophet about the Campaign of Tabuk\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis not correct. They relate the event in a way as if the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnews of the mustering of the Roman armies near the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabian frontier was itself false. The fact is that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCaesar had begun to muster his armies, but the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet forestalled him and arrived on the scene before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the could make full preparations for the invasion.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, believing that \"discretion is the better part\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof valor,\" he withdrew his armies from the frontier. For\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the had not forgotten that the three thousand fighters for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe cause of Islam had rendered helpless his army one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thundred thousand strong at M'utah. He could not,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore, even with an army of two hundred thousand,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdare to fight against an army of thirty thousand, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat, too, under the leadership of the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself. When the Holy Prophet found that the Caesar had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithdrawn his forces from the frontier, he considered the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestion whether it would be worthwhile to march into the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSyrian territory or to halt at Tabuk and turn his moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvictory to political and strategic advantage. He decided\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the latter course and made a halt for twenty days at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTabuk. During this time, he brought pressure on the small\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstates that lay between the Roman Empire and the Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tState and were at that time under the influence of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRomans, and subdued and made them the tributaries of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic State. For instance, some Christian chiefs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUkaidir bin Abdul Malik Kindi of Dumatul Jaiidal, Yuhanna\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin D'obah of Ailah, and the chiefs of Maqna, Jarba' and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAzruh also submitted and agreed to pay Jizyah to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic State of Al-Madinah. As a result of this, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboundaries of the Islamic State were extended right up to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Roman Empire, and the majority of the Arab clans, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere being used by the Caesar against Arabia, became the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallies of the Muslims against the Romans. Above all, this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmoral victory of Tabuk afforded a golden opportunity to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims to strengthen their hold on Arabia before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentering into a long conflict with the Romans. For it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbroke the back of those who had still been expecting that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe old order of 'ignorance' might revive in the near\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfuture, whether they were the open upholders of shirk or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe hypocrites who were hiding their shirk under the garb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Islam. The majority of such people were compelled by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe force of circumstances to enter into the fold of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam and, at least, make it possible for their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescendants to become true Muslims. After this a mere\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timpotent minority of the upholders of the old order was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleft in the field, but it could not stand in the way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Islamic Revolution for the perfection of which Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad sent His Messenger.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Problems of the Period</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf we keep in view the preceding background, we can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teasily find out the problems that were confronting the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCommunity at that time. They were: (1)to make the whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Arabia a perfect Dar-ul-Islam, (2)to extend the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinfluence of Islam to the adjoining\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountries,\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(3)to crush the mischiefs of the hypocrites, and (4)to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprepare the Muslims for Jihad against the non-Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow that the administration of the whole of Arabia had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcome in the hands of the Believers, and all the opposing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpowers had become helpless, it was necessary to make a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclear declaration of that policy which was to be adopted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto make her a perfect Dar-ul-Islam Therefore the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowing measures were adopted.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA clear declaration was made that all the treaties with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mushriks were abolished and the Muslims would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treleased from the treaty obligations with them after a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trespite of four months.(vv. 1-3). This declaration was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary for uprooting completely the system of life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbased on shirk and to make Arabia exclusively the center\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Islam so that it should not in any way interfere with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe spirit of Islam nor become an internal danger for it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA decree was issued that the guardianship of the Kaabah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich held central position in all the affairs of Arabia,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be wrested from the mushriks and placed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermanently in the hands of the Believers, (vv. 12-18)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat all the customs and practices of the shirk of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tera of 'ignorance' should be forcibly abolished: that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmushriks should not be allowed even to come near the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"House\" (v. 28). This was to eradicate every trace of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshirk from the \"House\" that was dedicated exclusively to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe worship of Allah. The evil practice of Nasi, by which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey used to tamper with the sacred months in the days of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'ignorance', was forbidden as an act of kufr (v. 37).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis was also to serve as an example to the Muslims for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teradicating every vestige of the customs of ignorance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the life of Arabia (and afterwards from the lives of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims everywhere). In order to enable the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto extend the influence of Islam outside Arabia, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere enjoined to crush with sword the non-Muslim powers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand to force them to accept the sovereignty of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic State. As the great Roman and Iranian Empires\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere the biggest hindrances in the way, a conflict with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem was inevitable. The object of Jihad was not to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcoerce them to accept Islam-they were free to accept or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot to accept it-but to prevent them from thrusting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforcibly their deviations upon others and the coming\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgenerations. The Muslims were enjoined to tolerate their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmisguidance only to the extent that they might have the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfreedom to remain misguided, if they chose to be so,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovided that they paid Jizyah (v. 29) as a sign of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubjugation to the Islamic State.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe third important problem was to crush the mischiefs of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe hypocrites, who had hitherto been tolerated in spite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof their flagrant crimes. Now that there was practically\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno pressure upon them from outside, the Muslims were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoined to treat them openly as disbelievers (v. 73).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccordingly, the Holy Prophet set on fire the house of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSwailim, where the hypocrites used to gather for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsultations in order to dissuade the people from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjoining the expedition to Tabuk. Likewise on his return\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Tabuk, he ordered to pull down and burn the 'Mosque'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat had been built to serve as a cover for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites for hatching plots against the true Believers.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn order to prepare the Muslims for Jihad against the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole non-Muslim world, it was necessary to cure them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven of that slight weakness of faith from which they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere still suffering. For there could be no greater\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinternal danger to the Islamic Community than the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tweakness of faith, especially where it was going to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tengage itself single-handed in a conflict with the whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnon-Muslim world. That is why those people who had lagged\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehind in the Campaign to Tabuk or had shown the least\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnegligence were severely taken to task, and were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsidered as hypocrites if they had no plausible excuse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor not fulfilling that obligation. Moreover, a clear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeclaration was made that in future the sole criterion of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta Muslim's faith shall be the exertions he makes for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuplift of the Word of Allah and the role he plays in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconflict between Islam and kufr. Therefore, if anyone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill show any hesitation in sacrificing his life, money,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime and energies, his faith shall not be regarded as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgenuine. (vv. 81-96). If the above-mentioned important\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoints are kept in view during the study of this Surah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit will facilitate the understanding of its contents.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

But there are some people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho are of the opinion, that some of its verses were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed at Al-Madinah. This is, however, a superficial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tview. The continuity of the theme clearly shows that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes not comprise isolated verses or discourses that were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed at different times and on different occasions.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the contrary, it is, from the beginning to the end, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclosely connected discourse which must have been revealed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat one sitting. Besides this, the nature of its theme is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\titself a clear proof that the Surah belongs to the Makkan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Time of Revelation</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWe have no tradition in regard to the time of it's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation, but its subject matter gives clear indication\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it must have been revealed during the last stage of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet's residence at Makkah. For the mode of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe discourse suggests that at the time of its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation, the antagonism of the opponents of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessage had become so intense that they could not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttolerate even the presence of the Holy Prophet and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowers among themselves, and that things had come to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch a pass as to leave no hope that they would ever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstand and accept the Message of the Prophet. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindicates that the last stage of the Prophet's life among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people had come, and the final warning like the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin this Surah had to be given. These characteristics of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe discourse are clear proof that it was revealed during\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe last stage of the Movement at Makkah. Another thing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat determines more specifically the order of the Surahs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the last stage at Makkah is the mention (or absence)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof some open or covert hint about Hijrat (Emigration)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Makkah. As this Surah does not contain any hint\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhatsoever about this, it is a proof that it preceded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose surahs which contain it. Now that we have specified\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe time of its revelation, there is no need of repeating\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits historical background because that has already been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstated in Surahs VI and VII.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Subject</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis discourse deals with the invitation to the Message,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmonition and warning. In the very introductory verses,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe invitation has been extended like this: \"The people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsider it a strange thing that this Message is being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconveyed by a human being and charge him with sorcery,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhereas there is nothing strange in it nor has it any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconnection with sorcery or soothsaying. It simply informs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou of two realities. First, Allah, Who has created the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuniverse and manages it, is, in fact, your Master and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLord, and He alone is entitled to your worship. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecond reality is that after the life in this world,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere will be another life in the Next World, where you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshall have to render full account of the life of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld and be rewarded or punished according to whether\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou adopted the righteous attitude as required by Him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter acknowledging Him as your Masters or acted against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis will. Both of these realities, which the Messenger is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresenting before you, are 'realities' in themselves\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhether you acknowledge them as such or not. He is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinviting you to accept these and regulate your lives in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccordance with them; if you accept these, you will have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta very blessed end; otherwise join shall meet with evil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequences.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

This is also supported by a Tradition: It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated that after its revelation, once Hadrat Abu Bakr\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid to the Holy Prophet, \"Of late I have been noticing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat you are growing older and older. What is the cause\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof it?\" The Holy Prophet replied, \"Surah Hud and the like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs have made me old.\" This shows that it was a very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thard time for the Holy Prophet and these stern warnings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadded greatly to his anxieties that were caused by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersecution from the Quraish, who were doing their worst\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto crush down the Message of Islam. For it was obvious to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet that the last limit of the respite given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Allah was approaching nearer and nearer and he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafraid lest the term of the respite should expire and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople be seized by the torment.

Only that one is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trescued who had believed in the Prophet, and none else,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot even his own son or wife. More than that: the Faith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemands from each and every Believer that he should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttotally forget his relationships when that judgment comes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand remember only the relationship of the Faith. For it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis against the spirit of Islam to show any regard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhatsoever for the relationships of blood and race.

At\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat time some of the unbelievers put this question\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(probably at the instigation of the Jews) to test him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t:\"Why did the Israelites go to Egypt?\" This question was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked because they knew that their story was not known to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Arabs for there was no mention of it whatever in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir traditions and the Holy Prophet had never even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treferred to it before. Therefore they expected that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould not be able to give any satisfactory answer to this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestion or would first evade it, and afterwards try to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinquire about it from some Jew, and thus he would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttotally exposed. But, contrary to their expectations, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttables were turned on them, for Allah revealed the whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstory of Prophet Joseph then and there, and the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet recited it on the spot. This put the Quraish in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvery awkward position because it not only foiled their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscheme but also administered a warning to them by aptly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapplying it to their case, as if to say, \"As you are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehaving towards this Prophet, exactly in the same way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe brothers of Prophet Joseph behaved towards him; so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou shall meet with the same end.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Objects of Revelation</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFrom the above it is clear that this Surah was sent down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor two objects: The first object was to give the proof\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Prophethood of Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim), and that too, the one demanded by the opponents\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves so as to prove conclusively that his knowledge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas not based on mere hearsay, but was gained through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRevelation. This aspect has been stated explicitly in its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintroductory verses and explained plainly in its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcluding portion. The second object was to apply it to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quraish and warn them that ultimately the conflict\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween them and the Holy Prophet would end in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvictory over them. As they were then persecuting their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrother, the Holy Prophet, in the same way the brothers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Prophet Joseph had treated him. The Quraish were told\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindirectly that they would also fail in their evil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdesigns just as the brothers of Prophet Joseph had failed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin his case, even after casting him into the well. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis because none has the power to defeat the Divine will.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd just as the brothers of Prophet Joseph had to humble\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves before him, so one day the Quraish shall have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto beg forgiveness from their brother whom they were then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrying to crush down. This, too, has been made quite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplain in v. 7: \"Indeed there are signs in this story of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJoseph and his brothers for these inquirers from among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quraish.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe fact is that by applying this story to the conflict,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran had made a bold and clear prophecy, which was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfulfilled literally by the events that happened in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsucceeding ten years. Hardly two years had passed after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits revelation, when the Quraish conspired to kill the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet like the brothers of Prophet Joseph, and he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad to emigrate from Makkah to Al-Madinah, where he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgained the same kind of power as Prophet Joseph had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgained in Egypt. Again, in the end the Quraish had to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thumble themselves before him just like the brothers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Joseph, when they humbly requested, \"Show mercy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto us for Allah rewards richly those who show mercy\" (V.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t88), and Prophet Joseph generously forgave them, (though\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the had complete power to wreak vengeance on them,)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying, \" today no penalty shall be inflicted on you. May\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah forgive you:He is the greatest of all those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforgive\" (V. 92). The same story of mercy was repeated,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen after the conquest of Makkah, the crestfallen\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish stood meekly before the Holy Prophet, who had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfull power to wreak his vengeance on them for each and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery cruelty committed by them. But instead, he merely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked them, \"What treatment do you expect from me now?\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey replied, \"You are a generous brother and the son of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta generous brother.\" At this, he very generously forgave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem, saying, \"I will give the same answer to your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trequest that Joseph gave to his brothers: today, no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpenalty shall be inflicted on you: you are forgiven.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Topics of Discussion</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMoreover, the Quran does not relate this story as a mere\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnarrative but uses it, as usual, for the propagation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Message in the following ways:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThroughout the narrative the Quran has made it clear that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Faith of Prophets Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Allah's peace be upon them all) was the same as that of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvited the people to the same Message to which Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Allah's peace be upon him) was inviting them.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen it places the characters of Prophet Jacob and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Joseph side by side with the characters of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrothers of Joseph, the members of the trade caravan, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcourt dignitary; Al Aziz of Egypt and his wife, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"ladies\" of Egypt and the rulers of Egypt and poses a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsilent question to the reader, as if to say, \"Contrast\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe former characters molded by Islam on the bedrock of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe worship of Allah and accountability in the Hereafter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the latter molded by kufr and \"ignorance\" on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworship of the world and disregard of Allah and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter, and decide for yourselves which of these two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpatterns you would choose.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Quran has used this story to bring forth another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruth: whatever Allah wills, He fulfills it anyhow, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman can never defeat His plan with his counterplans nor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevent it from happening nor change it in any way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhatever. Nay, it often so happens that man adopts some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeasure to fulfill his own design and believes that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas done that very thing which would fulfill his design,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut in the end he finds to his dismay that he had done\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething which was against his own and conducive to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDivine purpose. When the brothers of Prophet Joseph cast\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim into the well, they believed that they had once for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall got rid of the obstacle in their way but in fact,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey had paved the way for the Divine purpose of making\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim the ruler of Egypt, before whom they would have to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thumble themselves in the end. Likewise, the wife of Aziz\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad sent Prophet Joseph to the prison, gloating over the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthought that she had wrought her vengeance on him, but,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin fact, she had provided for him the opportunity for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecoming the ruler of Egypt and for putting herself to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe shame of confessing her own sin publicly.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd these are not the solitary instances which prove the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruth that even if the whole world united to bring about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe down fall of the one whom Allah willed to raise high,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit could not succeed. Nay, the very \"sure and effective\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeasures that were adopted by the brothers to degrade\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJoseph were used by Allah for the success of Joseph and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the humiliation and disgrace of his brothers. On the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother hand, if Allah willed the fall of one, no measure,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowsoever effective, could raise him high: nay, it helped\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto bring about his fall and the disgrace of those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadopted them.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMoreover, the story contains other lessons for those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintend to follow the way of Allah. The first lesson it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteaches is that one should remain within the limits,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprescribed by the Divine Law, in one's aims and objects\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand measures, for success and failure are entirely in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thands of Allah. Therefore if one adopts pure aims and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlawful measures but fails, at least one will escape\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tignominy and disgrace. On the other hand, the one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadopts an impure aim and unlawful measures to achieve it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshall not only inevitably meet with ignominy and disgrace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the Hereafter, but also runs the risk of ignominy and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisgrace in this world.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe second lesson it teaches is that those who exert for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe cause of truth and righteousness and put their trust\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Allah and entrust all their affairs to Him, get\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsolation and comfort from Him, for this helps them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tface their opponents with confidence and courage and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo not lose heart, when they encounter the apparently\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterrifying measures of the powerful enemies. They will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersevere in their task without fear and leave the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresults to Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut the greatest lesson this story teaches is that if the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBeliever possesses true Islamic character and is endowed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith wisdom, he can conquer a whole country with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrength of his character alone. The marvelous example of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Joseph teaches us that a man of high and pure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharacter comes out successful even under the most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadverse circumstances. When Prophet Joseph went to Egypt,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the was only a lad of seventeen years, a foreigner, all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talone and without any provisions; nay, he had been sold\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere as a slave. And the horrible condition of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslaves during that period is known to every student of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory. Then he was charged with a heinous moral crime\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand sent to prison for an indefinite term. But throughout\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis period of affliction, he evinced the highest moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqualities which raised him to the highest rank in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountry.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Historical and Geographical Background</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe following historical and geographical details will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelp understand the story: Prophet Joseph was a son of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Jacob and a grandson of Prophet Isaac and a great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrandson of Prophet Abraham (Allah's peace be upon them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall). The Bible says (and the allusions in the Quran also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfirm this) that Prophet Jacob had twelve sons from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfour wives. Prophet Joseph and his younger brother\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBenjamin were from one wife and the other ten from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother wives. Prophet Jacob had settled at Hebron\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Palestine) where his father Prophet Isaac and before him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Abraham lived and owned a piece of land at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tShechem as well.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to the research scholars of the Bible, Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJoseph was born in or about 906 B. C. and the incident\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith which this story begins happened in or about 890 B.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tC. He was seventeen when he saw the dream and was thrown\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto the well. This well was near Dothan to the north of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tShechem according to Biblical and Talmudic traditions,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the caravan, which took him out of the well, was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcoming from Gilead (Trans-Jordan), and was on its way to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEgypt. At that time Fifteenth Dynasty ruled over Egypt,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhose rulers are known in history as the Hyksos kings.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey belonged to the Arab race, but had migrated from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPalestine and Syria to Egypt in or about 2000 B.C. and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken possession of the country. The Arab historians and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe commentators of the Quran have given them the name of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmaliq (the Amalekites), and this has been corroborated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the recent researches made by the Egyptologists. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere foreign invaders who had got the opportunity of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablishing their kingdom because of the internal feuds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the country. That is why there was no prejudice in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tway of Prophet Joseph's ascendancy to power and in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubsequent settlement of the Children of Israel in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost fertile region of Egypt. They could gain that power\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand influence which they did, because they belonged to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same race as the foreign rulers of Egypt.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Hyksos ruled over Egypt up to the end of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfifteenth century B.C., and practically all the powers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremained in the hands of the Israelites. The Quran has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade a reference to this in v. 20 of Al-Ma'idah: ...He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\traised Prophets among you and made you rulers..., Then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere arose a great nationalist movement which overthrew\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe power of this dynasty and exiled 250,000 or so of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmalekites. As a result of this, a very bigoted dynasty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Copts came into power and uprooted everything\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconnected with the Amalekites. Then started that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersecution of the Israelites which has been mentioned in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconnection with the story of Prophet Moses.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWe also learn from the history of Egypt that the \"Hyksos\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkings\" did not acknowledge the gods of Egypt and,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore, had imported their own gods from Syria, with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tview to spreading their own religion in Egypt. This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe reason why the Quran has not called the king who was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe contemporary of Prophet Joseph by the title of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Pharaoh,\" because this title was associated with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligion of the original people of Egypt and the Hyksos\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid not believe in it, but the Bible erroneously calls\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim \"Pharaoh\". It appears that the editors of the Bible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad the misunderstanding that all the kings of Egypt were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Pharaohs.\" The modern research scholars who have made a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomparative study of the Bible and the Egyptian history\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare generally of the opinion that Apophis was the Hyksos\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tking, who was the contemporary of Prophet Joseph.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt that time Memphis was the capital of Egypt, whose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\truins are still found on the Nile at a distance of 4\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmiles south of Cairo. When Prophet Joseph was taken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere, he was 17 or 18 years old. He remained in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thouse of Aziz for three years and spent nine years in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprison, and then became the ruler of the land at the age\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof thirty and ruled over Egypt independently for eighty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyears. In the ninth or tenth year of his rule he sent for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this father, Prophet Jacob, to come from Palestine to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEgypt with all the members of his family and, according\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Bible, settled them in the land of Goshen, where\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey lived up to the time of Prophet Moses. The Bible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsays that before his death, Prophet Joseph bound his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkindred by an oath: \"when you return from this country to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe house of your forefathers you must take my bones out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof this country with you.\" So he died a hundred and ten\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyears old, and they embalmed him.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThough the story of Prophet Joseph as given in the Quran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiffers very much in its details from that given in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBible and the Talmud, the Three generally agree in regard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto its component parts.

This is a proof that both\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthese Surahs (6 and 16) were sent down in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsame period.

In Makkah itself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe true Believers had formed themselves into a small\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommunity and were ready and willing to face every danger\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto make Islam a success. Besides them, a very large\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnumber of the people of Aus and Khazraj (two influential\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclans of Al- Madinah) had accepted Islam.

The disbelievers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah had been admonished to take a lesson from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmiserable end of the Israelites and other communities and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmend their ways within the period of respite given by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, which was about to expire.

Accordingly, convincing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\targuments have been put forward to prove that the Quran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the Book of Allah and its teachings are true and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgenuine, the doubts of the disbelievers about these basic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealities have been removed and on suitable occasions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey have been admonished and rebuked in regard to their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tways of ignorance.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this connection, those fundamental principles of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmorality and civilization on which the Islamic System of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife is meant to be established have been put forward.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThus this was a sort of the Manifesto of the intended\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic state which had been proclaimed a year before its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactual establishment.

We have already\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivided the life of the Holy Prophet at Makkah into four\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstages in the Introduction to Chapter 6. According to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat division the third stage lasted from the fifth to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe tenth year of Prophethood. What distinguishes this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstage from the second and the fourth stages is this.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDuring the second stage the Quraish mainly resorted to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tridiculing, scoffing, threatening, tempting, raising\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobjections and making false propaganda against the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet and his followers in order to suppress the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic Movement. But during the third stage they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temployed the weapons of persecution, manhandling and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teconomic pressure for the same purpose. So much so that a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlarge number of the Muslims had to emigrate from Arabia\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Habash, and those who remained behind were besieged in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tShi'ib Abi Talib along with the Holy Prophet and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfamily. To add to their misery, a complete social and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teconomic boycott was applied against them. The only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tredeeming feature was that there were two personalities,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Talib and Hadrat Khadijah, whose personal influence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad been conducive to the support of two great families\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Quraish. However, when in the tenth year of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood these two persons died, the fourth stage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegan with such revere persecutions as forced the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet and all his Companions to emigrate from Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt appears from the theme of the Surah that it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed at the beginning of the third stage when in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspite of persecutions and opposition, migration to Habash\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad not yet taken place. That is why the story of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Ashab-i-Kahf\" (the Sleepers of the Cave) has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated to comfort and encourage the persecuted Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand to show them how the righteous people have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaving their Faith in the past.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Subject and Topics</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah was sent down in answer to the three questions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich the mushriks of Makkah, in consultation with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of the Book, had put to the Holy Prophet in order\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto test him. These were: \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWho were \"the Sleepers of the Cave\"? \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is the real story of Khidr? \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat do you know about Zul- Qarnain?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs these three questions and the stories involved\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerned the history of the Christians and the Jews, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere unknown in Hijaz, a choice of these was made to test\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhether the Holy Prophet possessed any source of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknowledge of the hidden and unseen things. Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, not only gave a complete answer to their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestions but also employed the three stories to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisadvantage of the opponents of Islam in the conflict\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat was going on at that time at Makkah between Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand unbelief.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe questioners were told that \"the Sleepers of the Cave\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieved in the same doctrine of Tauhid which was being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tput forward in the Quran and that their condition was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimilar to the condition of the persecuted Muslims of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah. On the other hand, the persecutors of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSleepers of the Cave had behaved in the same way towards\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem as the disbelievers of the Quraish were behaving\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttowards the Muslims. Besides this, the Muslims have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaught that even if a Believer is persecuted by a cruel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsociety, he should not bow down before falsehood but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temigrate from the place all alone, if need be, with trust\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin God. Incidentally the disbelievers of Makkah were told\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the story of the Sleepers of the Cave was a clear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproof of the creed of the Hereafter, for this showed that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah has the power to resurrect anyone He wills even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter a long sleep of death as He did in case of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSleepers of the Cave.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe story of the Sleepers of the Cave has also been used\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto warn the chiefs of Makkah who were persecuting the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsmall newly formed Muslim Community. At the same time,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet has been instructed that he should in no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcase make a compromise with their persecutors nor should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the consider them to be more important than his poor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowers. On the other hand, those chiefs have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmonished that they should not be puffed up with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttransitory life of pleasure they were then enjoying but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould seek after those excellence which are permanent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand eternal.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe story of Khidr and Moses has been related in such a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tway as to supply the answer to the question of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers and to give comfort to the Believers as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell. The lesson contained in this story is this: You\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould have full faith in the wisdom of what is happening\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the Divine Factory in accordance with the will of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah. As the reality is hidden from you, you are at a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tloss to understand the wisdom of what is happening, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsometimes if it appears that things are going against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou, you cry out, \"How and why has this happened?\". The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfact is that if the curtain be removed from the \"unseen\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou would yourselves come to know that what is happening\\n\\t\\t\\t\\there is for the best. Even if sometimes it appears that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething is going against you, you will see that in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tend it also produces some good results for you.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe same is true of the story of zul-Qarnain for it also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmonishes the questioners, as if to say, \"O you vain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchiefs of Makkah you should learn a lesson from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzul-Qarnain. Though he was a great ruler, a great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconqueror and the owner of great resources, yet he always\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurrendered to his Creator, whereas you are rebelling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst Him even though you are insignificant chieftains\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin comparison with him. Besides this, though zul-Qarnain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbuilt one of the strongest walls for protection, yet his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treal trust was in Allah and not in the 'wall'. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieved that the wall could protect him against his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenemies as long as it was the will of Allah and that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere would be cracks and holes in it, when it would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis will; whereas you who possess only insignificant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfortified abodes and dwellings in comparison with him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsider yourselves to be permanently safe and secure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst all sorts of calamities.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhile the Quran turned the tables on the questioners who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad tried to \"expose\" the Holy Prophet, in the end of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah the same things have been reiterated that were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstated at its beginning: \"Tauhid and the Hereafter are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsolutely true and real and for your own good you should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept these doctrines, mend your ways in accordance with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem and live in this world with this conviction that you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare accountable to Allah: otherwise you shall ruin your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife and all your doings shall be set at naught.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Here we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshall give rather fuller details of the same conditions,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich will be helpful in grasping the meaning of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah and the other Surahs of the period. When the chiefs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Quraish felt that they had failed to suppress the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic movement by ridicule, sarcasm, and by holding out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpromises and threats and by making false accusations,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey resorted to persecution, beating and economic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpressure. They would catch hold of the new Muslims of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir clans and persecute them, starve them and would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven inflict physical torture on them in order to coerce\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem to give up Islam. The most pitiful victims of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersecution were the poor people and the slaves and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproteges of the Quraish. They were beaten black and blue,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere imprisoned and kept thirsty and hungry and were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdragged on the burning sands of Makkah. The people would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tget work from the professional laborers but would not pay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem their wages. As an instance we give below the story\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Hadrat Khabbab bin Arat, which is given in Bukhari and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim: \"I used to work as a blacksmith in Makkah. Once I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid some work for As bin Wa'il. When I went to ask for my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twages, he said, 'I will not pay your wages unless you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisown Muhammad'.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the same connection Hadrat Khabbab says, \"One day the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet was sitting in the shadow of the Kaabah. I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twent to him and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, now\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersecution has gone to its extreme; why do you not pray\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Allah (for relief)?' At this the Holy Prophet was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreatly moved. He said, 'The believers before you were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersecuted much more than you. Their bones were scraped\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith combs of iron and their heads were cut with saws,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut still they did not give up their Faith. I assure you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Allah will fulfill this Mission, and there will come\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta period of such peace that one would travel from Sanna\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Hadramaut, and he will have no fear from anyone, save\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah. But you people have already become impatient'.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Bukhari)\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the conditions became unbearable, the Holy Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the month of Rajab of the fifth year of Prophethood,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgave advice to his Companions to this effect: \"You may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell migrate to Habash, for there is a king, who does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallow any kind of injustice to anyone, and there is good\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin his land. You should remain there till the time that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah provides a remedy for your affliction\".\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccordingly, at first, eleven men and four women left for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHabash. The Quraish pursued them up to the coast but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfortunately they got a timely boat for Habash at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsea-port of Shu'aibah, and they escaped arrest. Then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter a few months, other people migrated to Habash and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir number rose to eighty-three men and eleven women of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quraish and seven non-Quraish. After this, only forty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersons were left with the Holy Prophet at Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere was a great hue and cry in Makkah after this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMigration, for every family of the Quraish was adversely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffected by this. There was hardly a family of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish which did not lose a son, a son-in-law, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdaughter, a brother or a sister. For instance, there were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the Migrants the near relatives of Abu Jahl, Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSufyan and other chief of the Quraish who were notorious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor their persecution of the Muslims. As a result of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis, some of them became even more bitter in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenmity of Islam, while there were others who were so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmoved by this that they embraced Islam. For instance,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Migration left a deep mark on Hadrat Umar. One of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this relatives, Laila, daughter of Hathmah, says, \"I was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpacking my luggage for Migration, while my husband, Amr\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Rabiy'ah, had gone out. In the meantime Umar came\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere and began to watch me, while I was engaged in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreparation for the journey. Then he said, 'Are you also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoing to migrate?' I answered, 'Yes by God, you people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave persecuted us much. But the wide earth of Allah is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topen for us. Now we are going to a place where Allah will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrant us peace'. At this, I noticed such signs of emotion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the face of Umar as I had never seen before. He simply\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'May God be with you' and went away.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter the migration, the Quraish held consultations, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecided to send Abdullah bin Abi Rabiy'ah, half brother\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Abu Jahl, and Amr bin As to Habash with precious gifts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso as to persuade Negus to send the migrants back to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah. Hadrat Umm Salmah (a wife of the Holy Prophet),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho was among the migrants, has related this part of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstory in detail. She says, \"When these two clever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatesmen of the Quraish reached Habash, they distributed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe gifts among the courtiers of the King and persuaded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem to recommend strongly to him to send the migrants\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tback. Then they saw Negus himself and, presenting rich\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgifts to him, said, 'Some headstrong brats of our city\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave come to your land and our chiefs have sent us to you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the request that you may kindly send them back.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese brats have forsaken our faith and have not embraced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour faith either, but have invented a new faith'. As\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsoon as they had finished their speech, all the courtiers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecommended their case, saying, 'We should send such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople back to their city for their people know them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetter. It is not proper for us to keep them here'. At\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis the King was annoyed and said, 'I am not going to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgive them back without proper inquiry. As these people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave put their trust in my country rather than in any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother country and have come here to take shelter, I will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot betray them. At first I will send for them and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvestigate into the allegations these people have made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst them. Then I will make my final decision'.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccordingly, the King sent for the Companions of the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet and asked them to come to his court.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the migrants received the message of the King, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassembled and held consultations as to what they should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay to the King. At last they came to this unanimous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecision: '\"We will present before the King the teachings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Holy Prophet without adding anything to or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithholding anything from them and leave it to him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhether he lets us remain here or turns us out of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountry'. When they came to the court, the King put this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproblem abruptly before them: 'I understand that you have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven up the faith of your own people and have neither\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tembraced my faith nor any other existing faith. I would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike to know what your new faith is.' At this, Jafar bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbi Talib, on behalf of the migrants, made an extempore\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspeech to this effect: 'O King! We were sunk deep in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tignorance and had become very corrupt; then Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Allah's peace be upon him) came to us as a Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod, and did his best to reform us. But the Quraish began\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto persecute his followers, so we have come to your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountry in the hope that here we will be free from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersecution'. After his speech, the King said, 'Please\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecite a piece of the Revelation which has been sent down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby God to your Prophet'. In response, Hadrat Jafar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited that portion of Surah Maryam which relates the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstory of Prophets John and Jesus (Allah's peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem). The King listened to it and wept, so much so that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this beard became wet with tears. When Hadrat Jafar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfinished the recital, he said: 'Most surely this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRevelation and the Message of Jesus have come from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame source. By God I will not give you up into the hands\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof these people'.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNext day Amr bin As went to Negus and said, 'Please send\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor them again and ask them concerning the creed they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thold about Jesus, the son of Mary, for they say a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thorrible thing about him'. The King again sent for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmigrants, who had already learnt about the scheme of Amr.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey again sat together and held consultations in regard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the answer they should give to the King, if he asked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout the belief they held about Prophet Jesus. Though\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis was a very critical situation and all of them were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuneasy about it, they decided that they would say the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame thing that Allah and His Messenger had taught them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccordingly, when they went to the court, the King put\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem the question that had been suggested by Amr bin As.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSo Jafar bin Abi Talib stood up and answered without the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleast hesitation: 'He was a Servant of Allah and His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger. He was a Spirit and a Word of Allah which had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen sent to virgin Mary.' At this the King picked up a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstraw from the ground and said, 'By God, Jesus was not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworth this straw more than what you have said about him.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this the King returned the gifts sent by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish, saying, 'I do not take any bribe'. Then he said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the migrants, 'You are allowed to stay here in perfect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace'.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKeeping in view this historical background, it becomes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquite obvious that this Surah was sent down to serve the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmigrants as a \"provision\" for their journey to Habash, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif to say, \"Though you are leaving your country as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersecuted emigrants to a Christian country, you should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot in the least hide anything from the teachings you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave received. Therefore you should plainly say to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChristians that Prophet Jesus was not the son of God.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter relating the story of Prophets John and Jesus in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvv. 1-40, the story of Prophet Abraham has been related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(vv. 41-50) also for the benefit of the Migrants for he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso had been forced like them to leave his country by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe persecution of his father, his family and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountrymen. On the one hand, this meant to console the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmigrants that they were following the footsteps of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Abraham and would attain the same good end as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Prophet did. On the other hand, it meant to warn the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers of Makkah that they should note it well that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were in the position of the cruel people who had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersecuted their forefather and leader, Abraham, while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslim Emigrants were in the position of Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbraham himself.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen the mention of the other Prophets has been made in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvv. 51-65 with a view to impress that Muhammad (Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace be upon him) had brought the same way of Life that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad been brought by the former Prophets but their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowers had become corrupt and adopted wrong ways.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the concluding passage (vv. 66-98), a strong criticism\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been made of the evil ways of the disbelievers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah, while the Believers have been given the good news\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they would come out successful and become the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeloved of the people, in spite of the worst efforts of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe enemies of the Truth.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

There he found his sister,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFatimah, and his brother-in-law, Said bin Zaid, learning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe contents of a scroll from Khabbab bin Art. When\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFatimah saw him coming she hid the scroll at once, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Umar had heard the recital, so he began to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterrogate them about it. Then he began to thrash his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrother-in-law, and wounded his sister, who tried to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprotect him. At last both of them confessed, \"We have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome Muslims; you may do whatever you like.\" As Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUmar was moved to see blood running down from her head,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the said, \"Show me the thing you were reading.\" The sister\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked him to promise on oath that he would not tear it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand added, \"You cannot touch it unless you have a bath.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccordingly, Hadrat Umar took his bath and when he began\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto read the scroll, which contained this Surah, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspontaneously spoke out, \"What an excellent thing!\" At\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Hadrat Khabbab, who had hidden himself at the sound\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his footsteps, came out of his hiding and said, \"By\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod, I have high expectations that Allah will get great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tservice from you to propagate the Message of His Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor just yesterday I heard the Holy Prophet praying to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, 'My Lord, make Abul Hakam bin Hisham (Abu Jahl) or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUmar bin Khattab a supporter of Islam'. So O Umar, turn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Allah, turn to Allah.\" These words proved to be so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersuasive that he at once accompanied Hadrat Khabbab and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twent to the Holy Prophet to embrace Islam. This happened\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta short time after the Migration to Habash.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Topics of Discussion</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah begins with the enunciation of the object of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Revelation of the Quran to this effect:\"O Muhammad,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Quran has not been sent down to you to put you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunnecessarily to some great affliction. It does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemand from you to perform the impossible task of imbuing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe hearts of the obdurate disbelievers with Faith. It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmerely an admonition meant to guide on to the Right Path\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who fear God and want to save themselves from His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunishment. This Quran is the Word of the Master of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearth and the heavens and God-head belongs to Him alone:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese two facts are eternal whether one believes them or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this introduction, the Surah abruptly moves on to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelate the story of Prophet Moses without any apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelevancy and without even hinting at its applicability\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the events of the period. However, if we read between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe lines, we realize that the discourse is addressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvery relevantly to the people of Makkah. But before we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplain the hidden meaning of the discourse, we must keep\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin view the fact that the Arabs in general acknowledged\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMoses as a Prophet of God. This was so because they had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"been influenced by the large number of the Jews around\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem and by\" the neighbouring Christian kingdoms. Now let\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tus state those things which are hidden between the lines\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the story:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah does not appoint a Prophet by the beat of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdrums or by celebrating the occasion in a regular\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand formal ceremony, as if to say, \"We are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tappointing such and such a person as Our Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom today.\" On the contrary, He bestows\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood in a confidential manner just as He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdid in the case of Prophet Moses. Therefore you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tshould not consider it strange if Hadrat Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thas been appointed as a Prophet all of a sudden\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand without any public proclamation.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe fundamental principles presented by Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad Tauhid and the Hereafter are just the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsame as were taught to Prophet Moses at the time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof his appointment.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Muhammad has been made the standard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbearer of the Message of the Truth among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of the Quraish all by himself without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmaterial provisions, just as Prophet Moses was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tentrusted with the Mission to go to a tyrant king\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlike Pharaoh and ask him to give up his attitude\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof rebellion. These are the mysterious ways of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah. He catches hold of a wayfarer of Midian on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\this way to Egypt and says, \"Go and fight with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgreatest tyrant of the time.\" He did not provide\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thim with armies and provisions for this Mission.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe only thing He did was to appoint his brother\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tas his assistant at his request.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYou, O People of Makkah, should note it well that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPharaoh employed the same devices against Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMoses as you are employing against Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad; frivolous objections, accusations, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcruel persecutions. You should know that Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet came out victorious over Pharaoh, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpossessed large armies and war equipment.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIncidentally, the Muslims have been consoled and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcomforted, though not in so many words, that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tshould not be afraid of fighting with the Quraish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst fearful odds, for the mission which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsupported by Allah comes out victorious in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tend. At the same time, the Muslims have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\texhorted to follow the excellent example of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmagicians of Egypt, who remained steadfast in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir Faith, though Pharaoh threatened them with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thorrible vengeance.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAn incident from the story of the Israelites has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen cited to show in what ridiculous manner the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tidolization of false gods and goddesses starts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand that the Prophets of God do not tolerate even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe slightest tinge of this preposterous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice. Likewise, Prophet Muhammad is following\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe former Prophets in opposing shirk and idol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tworship today.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThus, the story of Moses has been used to throw light on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall those matters which were connected with the conflict\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween the Holy Prophet and the Quraish. Then at the end\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the story, the Quraish have been briefly admonished,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas if to say, \"The Quran has been sent down in your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttongue for your own good. If you listen to it and follow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits admonition, you will be doing so for your own good\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut if you reject it, you will yourselves meet with an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevil end.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this the story of Prophet Adam has been related, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif to tell the Quraish, \"The way you are following is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tway of Satan, whereas the right way for a man is to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollow his father Adam. He was beguiled by Satan, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen he realized his error, he plainly confessed it and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepented and again turned back to the service of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand won His favor. On the other hand, if a person follows\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSatan and sticks to his error obdurately in spite of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmonition, he does harm to himself alone like Satan.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the end, the Holy Prophet and the Muslims have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadvised not to be impatient in regard to the punishment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the disbelievers, as if to say, \"Allah has His Own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscheme concerning them. He does not seize them at once\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut gives them sufficient respite. Therefore you should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot grow impatient but bear the persecutions with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfortitude and go on conveying the Message.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this connection, great emphasis has been laid on salat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso that it may create in the believers the virtues of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpatience, forbearance, contentment, resignation to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill of God and self analysis for these are greatly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneeded in the service of the Message of the Truth.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

They believed that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlife was merely a sport and pastime and had no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpurpose behind or before it and there was no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccountability or reward or punishment.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe main cause of the conflict between the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers and the Holy Prophet was their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinsistence on the doctrine of shirk and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tantagonism to the Doctrine of Tauhid So the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdoctrine of shirk has been refuted and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDoctrine of Tauhid reinforced by weighty and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\timpressive though brief arguments.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArguments and admonitions have been used to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tremove another misunderstanding of theirs.

That is why this Surah combines the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharacteristics of both the Makki and the Madani Surahs.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe sudden change of the style from v. 25 shows that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprobably vv. 25-78 were sent down in the month of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZul-Hijjah in the very first year after Hijrah This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindicated by vv. 25-41 and confirmed by the occasion of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe revelation of vv. 39-40. It appears that the month of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZul-Hijjah must have brought to the immigrants nostalgic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmemories of their homes in Makkah and naturally they must\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave thought of their Sacred City and of their Hajj\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcongregation there, and grieved to think that the mushrik\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish had debarred them from visiting the Sacred\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMosque. Therefore, they might even have been praying for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand expecting Divine permission to wage war against those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttyrants who had expelled them from their homes and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeprived them of visiting the House of Allah and made it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifficult for them to follow the way of Islam. It was at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis psychological occasion that these verses were sent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown. That is why the purpose for which Masjid al Haram\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas built has been specifically mentioned. It has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade plain that Hajj (pilgrimage) had been enjoined for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe worship of One Allah. But it is an irony that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafterwards it had been dedicated to the rituals of shirk\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the worshipers of One Allah had been debarred from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvisiting it. Therefore, permission for waging war against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose tyrants has been given to oust them from there and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto establish the righteous way of life for establishing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvirtue and eradicating evil. According to Ibn Abbas,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMujahid, Urwah bin Zubair, Zaid bin Aslam, Muqatil bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHayyan, Qatadah and other great commentators, v. 39 is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe first verse that grants the Muslims permission to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twage war. Collections of Hadith and books on the life of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet confirm that after this permission\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactual preparations for war were started and the first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpedition was sent to the coast of the Red Sea in Safar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA.H. 2, which is known as the Expedition of Waddan or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Abwa.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Subject Matter and Theme </div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah is addressed to: \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mushriks of Makkah \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe wavering Muslims \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe True Believers. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe mushriks have been warned in a forceful manner to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis effect: \"You have obdurately and impudently\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersisted in your ideas of ignorance and trusted in your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeities instead of Allah, though they possess no power at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall and you have repudiated the Divine Messenger.

At the same time,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey have been admonished time and again for their creed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof shirk and sound arguments have been given in favor of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTauhid and the Hereafter.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe wavering Muslims, who had embraced Islam but were not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprepared to endure any hardship in its way, have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmonished to this effect: \"What is this faith of yours?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the one hand, you are ready to believe in Allah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome His servants provided you are given peace and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprosperity but, on the other, if you meet with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafflictions and hardships in His Way, you discard your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah and cease to remain His servant.

For\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit posed this question to the other clans of Arabia: Were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quraish mere attendants of the Holy Mosque or its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towners? It implied that if they succeeded in debarring\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims from Hajj without any protest from others,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey would feel encouraged in future to debar from Hajj\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Umrah the people of any other clan, who happened to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave strained relations with the Quraish. In order to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temphasize this point, the history of the construction of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Mosque has been cited to show that it was built\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Prophet Abraham by the Command of Allah and he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvited all the peoples to perform Hajj there. That is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhy those coming from outside had enjoyed equal rights by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe local people from the very beginning. It has also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen made clear that that House had not been built for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe rituals of shirk but for the worship of One Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThus it was sheer tyranny that the worship of Allah was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing forbidden there while the worship of idols enjoyed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfull licence.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn order to counteract the tyranny of the Quraish, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims were allowed to fight with them.

But there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis a difference of opinion as to whether this Campaign\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttook place in 5 A.H. before the Battle of the Trench or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin 6 A.H. after it. It is important to decide this issue\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin order to determine whether this Surah was sent down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearlier or Surah Al-Ahzab (33), which is the only other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah containing the Commandments about the observance of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurdah by women. Surah Al-Ahzab was admittedly sent down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the occasion of the Battle of the Trench. Now if this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBattle occurred earlier, it would mean that the initial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstructions in connection with the Commandments of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurdah were sent down in Surah Al-Ahzab and they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplemented later by the Commandments revealed in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah. On the other hand, if the Campaign against Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Mustaliq occurred earlier, the chronological order of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Commandments would be reversed, and it would become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifficult to understand the legal wisdom and implications\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Commandments of purdah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to Ibn Sa'd, the Campaign against Bani al\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMustaliq took place in Shaban 5 A.H. and the Battle of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Trench in Zil-Qa'dah the same year. This opinion is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbased on some traditions from Hadrat Ayesha about the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevents connected with the \"Slander\" in which she refers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto a dispute between Hadrat Sa'd bin 'Ubadah and Sa'd bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'az. Hadrat Sa'd bin Mu'az, according to authentic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditions, died during the Campaign against Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraizah, which took place immediately after the Battle\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Trench. It is, therefore, evident that he could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot be present in 6 A.H. to take part in a dispute about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe \"Slander\".\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the other hand, Muhammad bin Ishaq says that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBattle of the Trench took place in Shawwal 5 A.H. and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCampaign against Bani al-Mustaliq in Sha'aban 6 A.H. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topinion is supported by many authentic traditions from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Ayesha and others. According to these traditions, \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Commandments about purdah had been sent down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin Surah Al-Ahzab before the incident of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Slander\", \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet had married Hadrat Zainab in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tZil-Qa'dah 5 A.H. after the Battle of the Trench, \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHamnah, sister of Hadrat Zainab, had taken a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tleading part in spreading the \"Slander\", just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause Hadrat Ayesha was a rival of her sister.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAll this evidence supports the view of Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Ishaq.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow let us consider the two opinions a little more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclosely. The only argument in favor of the first opinion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the mention of the presence of Hadrat Sa'd bin Mu'az\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin a dispute connected with the incident of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Slander\". But this argument is weakened by some other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditions from Hadrat Ayesha, in which she mentions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadara Usaid bin Hudair instead of Hadrat Sa'd bin Mu'az\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin this dispute. It may, therefore, be assumed that there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been some confusion regarding the two names in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treporting the traditions. Moreover, if we accept the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst opinion, just because of the mention of the name of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Sa'd bin Mu'az in some traditions, we encounter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother difficulties that cannot be resolved in any way.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor, in that case, we shall have to admit that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation of the Commandments of purdah and the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's marriage with Hadrat Zainab had taken place\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven earlier than the Battle of the Trench. But we learn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the Quran and many authentic traditions that both\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese events happened after that Battle and the Campaign\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst Bani Quraizah. That is why Ibn Hazm, Ibn Qayyim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand some other eminent scholars have held the opinion of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad bin Ishaq as correct, and we also hold it to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso. Thus, we conclude that Surah Al Ahzab was sent down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearlier than Surah An-Nur, which was revealed in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlatter half of 6 A.H. several months after Surah Al\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhzab.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Historical Background</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow let us review the circumstances existing at the time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the revelation of this surah. It should be kept in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmind that the incident of the \"Slander\", which was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccasion of its revelation, was closely connected with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe conflict between Islam and the disbelievers.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter the victory at Badr, the Islamic movement began to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgain strength day by day; so much so that by the time of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Battle of the Trench, it had become so strong that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe united forces of the enemy numbering about ten\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthousand failed to crush it and had to raise the siege of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah after one month. It meant this, and both the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparties understood it well, that the war of aggression\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich the Disbelievers had been waging for several years,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad come to an end. The Holy Prophet himself declared:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"After this year, the Quraish will not be able to attack\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou; now you will take the offensive.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the disbelievers realized that they could not defeat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam on the battlefield, they chose the moral front to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcarry on the conflict. It cannot be said with certainty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhether this Change of tactics was the outcome of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeliberate consultations, or it was the inevitable result\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the humiliating retreat in the Battle of the Trench,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor which all the available forces of the enemy had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcentrated:They knew it well that the rise of Islam was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnor due to the numerical strength of the Muslims nor to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir superior arms and ammunition nor to their greater\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaterial resources; nay, the Muslims were fighting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst fearful odds on all these fronts. They owed their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuccess to their moral superiority. Their enemies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealized that the pure and noble qualities of the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet and his followers were capturing the hearts of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people, and were also binding them together into a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thighly disciplined community. As a result of this, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere defeating the mushriks and the Jews both on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace and on the war front, because the latter lacked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscipline and character.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUnder the above mentioned circumstances, the wicked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdesigns of the disbelievers led them to start a campaign\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof vilification against the Holy Prophet and the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin order to destroy the bulwark of morale that was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelping them to defeat their enemies. Therefore the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrategy was to attain the assistance of the hypocrites\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto spread slanders against the Holy Prophet and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowers so that the mushriks and the Jews could exploit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese to sow the seeds of discord among the Muslims and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tundermine their discipline.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe first opportunity for the use of the new strategy was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafforded in Zil-Qa'dah 5 A.H. when the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarried Hadrat Zainab (daughter of Jahsh), who was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivorced wife of his adopted son, Zaid bin Harithah. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet had arranged this marriage in order to put\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan end to the custom of ignorance, which gave the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatus to the adopted son that was the right only of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tson from one's own loins. The hypocrites, however,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsidered it a golden opportunity to vilify the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet from inside the community, and the Jews and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmushriks exploited it from outside to ruin his high\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treputation by this malicious slander. For this purpose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfantastic stories were concocted and spread to this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teffect: \"One day Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappened to see the wife of his adopted son and fell in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlove with her; he maneuvered her divorce and married\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther.\" Though this was an absurd fiction it was spread\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith such skill, cunning and artfulness that it succeeded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin its purpose; so much so that some Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditionalist and commentators also have cited some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparts of it in their writings, and the orientalists have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texploited these fully to vilify the Holy Prophet. As a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter of fact, Hadrat Zainab was never a stranger to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet that he should see her by chance and fall in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlove with her at first sight. For she was his first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcousin, being the daughter of his real paternal aunt,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUmaimah, daughter of Abdul Muttalib. He had known her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom her childhood to her youth. A year before this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident, he himself had persuaded her against her will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto marry Hadrat Zaid in order to demonstrate practically\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Quraish and the liberated slaves were equal as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thuman being. As she never reconciled herself to her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarriage with a liberated slave, they could not pull on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttogether for long, which inevitably led to her divorce.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe above mentioned facts were well known to all, yet the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslanderers succeeded in their false propaganda with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresult that even today there are people who exploit these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthings to defame Islam.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe second slander was made on the honor of Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAyesha, a wife of the Holy Prophet, in connection with an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident which occurred while he was returning from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCampaign against Bani al-Mustaliq. As this attack was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven severer than the first one and was the main\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbackground of this Surah, we shall deal with it in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreater detail.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLet us say a few words about Abdullah bin Ubayy, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplayed the part of a villain in this attack. He belonged\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the clan of Khazraj and was one of the most important\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchiefs of Al-Madinah. The people had even intended to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake him their king a little before the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmigration there, but the scheme had to be dropped because\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the changed circumstances. Though he had embraced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam, he remained at heart a hypocrite and his hypocrisy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas so manifest that he was called the \"Chief of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHypocrites\". He never lost any opportunity to slander\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam in order to take his revenge.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow the main theme. When in Sha'aban 6 A.H. the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet learned that the people of Bani al-Mustaliq were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaking preparations for a war against the Muslims and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere trying to muster other clans also for this purpose,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the fore- stalled and took the enemy by surprise. After\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcapturing the people of the clan and their belongings,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet made a halt near Muraisi, a spring in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir territory. One day a dispute concerning taking\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twater from the spring started between a servant of Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUmar and an ally of the clan of Khazraj, and developed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto a quarrel between the Muhajirs (immigrants) and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnsar (Muslims of Madina), but was soon settled. This,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, did not suit the strategy of Abdullah bin Ubayy,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho also had joined the expedition with a large number of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites. So he began to incite the Ansar, saying, \"You\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyourselves brought these people of the quraish from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah and made them partners in your wealth and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty. And now they have become your rivals and want\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdomination over you. If even now you withdraw your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupport from them, they shall be forced to leave your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcity.\" Then he swore and declared, \"As soon as we reach\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tback Al-Madinah, the respectable people will turn out the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdegraded people from the city.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the Holy Prophet came to know of this, he ordered\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people to set off immediately and march back to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Madinah. The forced march continued up to noon the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnext day without a halt on the way so that the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecame exhausted and had no time for idle talk.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThough this wise judgment and quick action by the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet averted the undesirable consequences of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmischief, Abdullah bin Ubayy got another opportunity for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoing a far more serious and greater mischief, i.e. by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tengineering a \"Slander\" against Hadrat Ayesha, for that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas a mischief which might well have involved the young\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim Community in a civil war, if the Holy Prophet and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this sincere and devoted followers had not shown wisdom,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforbearance and marvelous discipline in dealing with it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn order to understand the events that led to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident of the \"Slander\", we cite the story in Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Ayesha's own words. She says \"Whenever the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twent out on a journey, he decided by lots as to which of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this wives should accompany him. Accordingly, it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecided that I should accompany him during the expedition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Bani al Mustaliq. On the return journey, the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet halted for the night at a place which was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlast stage on the way back to Al-Madinah. It was still\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnight, when they began to make preparations for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarch. So I went outside the camp to ease myself. When I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturned and came near my halting place, I noticed that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmy necklace had fallen down somewhere. I went back in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsearch for it but in the meantime the caravan moved off\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand I was left behind all alone. The four carriers of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlitter had placed it on my camel without noticing that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas empty. This happened because of my light weight due\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto lack of food in those days. I wrapped myself in my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsheet and lay down in the hope that when it would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfound that I had been left behind, a search party would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcome back to pick me up. In the meantime I fell asleep.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the morning, when Safwan bin Mu'attal Sulami passed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat way, he saw me and recognized me for he had seen me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseveral times before the Commandment about purdah had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen sent down. No sooner did he see me than he stopped\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this camel and cried out spontaneously : \"How sad! The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twife of the Holy Prophet has been left here!\" At this I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twoke up all of a sudden and covered my face with my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsheet. Without uttering another word, he made his camel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkneel by me and stood aside, while I climbed on to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcamel back. He led the camel by the nose-string and we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tovertook the caravan at about noon, when it had just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thalted and nobody had yet noticed that I had been left\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehind. I learnt afterwards that this incident had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tused to slander me and Abdullah bin Ubayy was foremost\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the slanderers.\" (According to other traditions,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen Hadrat Ayesha reached the camp on the camel, led by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSafwan, and it was known that she had been left behind,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdullahbin Ubayy cried out, 'By God, she could not have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremained chaste. Look, there comes the wife of your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet openly on the camel led by the person with whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshe passed the night.')\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"When I reached Al-Madinah, I fell ill and stayed in bed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor more than a month. Though I was quite unaware of it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe news of the \"Slander\" was spreading like a scandal in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe city, and had also reached the Holy Prophet. Anyhow,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI noticed that he did not seem as concerned about my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tillness he used to be. He would come but without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taddressing me directly, would inquire from others how I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas and leave the house. Therefore it troubled my mind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat something had gone wrong somewhere. So I took leave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof him and went to my mother's house for better nursing.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"While I was there, one night I went out of the city to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tease myself in the company of Mistah's mother, who was a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst cousin of my mother. As she was walking along she\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstumbled over something and cried out spontaneously, 'May\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMistah perish!' To this I retorted, 'What a good mother\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou are that you curse your own son, the son who took\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpart in the Battle of Badr.' She replied, 'My dear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdaughter, are you not aware of his scandal mongering?'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen she told me everything about the campaign of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Slander'.\" (Besides the hypocrites, some true Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso had been involved in this campaign, and among them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho took leading part in it, were Mistah, Hassan bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThabit, the famous poet of Islam, and Hamnah, daughter of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJahsh and sister of Hadrat Zainab). \"Hearing this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thorrible story, my blood curdled, and I immediately\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturned home, and passed the rest of the night in crying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"During my absence the Holy Prophet took counsel with Ali\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Usamah bin Zaid about this matter. Usamah said good\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords about me to this effect: 'O Messenger of Allah, we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave found nothing but good in your wife. All that is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing spread about her is a lie and calumny.' As regards\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAli, he said, 'O Messenger of Allah, there is no dearth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof women; you may, if you like, marry an other wife. If,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, you would like to investigate into the matter,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou may send for her maid servant and inquire into it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough her.' Accordingly, the maid servant was sent for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand questioned. She replied, 'I declare on an oath by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, Who has sent you with the Truth, that I have never\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseen any evil thing in her, except that she falls asleep\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen I tell her to look after the kneaded dough in my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsence and a goat comes and eats it.'\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"On that same day the Holy Prophet addressed the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the pulpit, saying: 'O Muslims, who from among you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill defend my honor against the attacker of the person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho has transgressed all bounds in doing harm to me by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslandering my wife. By God, I have made a thorough\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinquiry and found nothing wrong with her nor with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman, whose name has been linked with the \"Slander\".' At\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Usaid bin Hudair (or Sa'd bin Mauz) according to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother traditions) stood up and said, 'O Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, if that person belongs to our clan, we will kill\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim by ourselves, but if he belongs to the Khazraj clan,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twe will kill him if you order us to do so.' Hearing this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSa'd bin 'Ubadah, chief of the Khazraj clan, stood up and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'You lie you can never kill him. You are saying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis just because the person belongs to our clan of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhazraj. Had he belonged to your clan, you would never\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave said so.' Hadrat Usaid retorted, 'You are a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrite: that is why you are defending a hypocrite.' At\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis, there was a general turmoil in the mosque, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould have developed into a riot, even though the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet was present there the whole time. But he cooled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown their anger and came down from the pulpit.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe remaining details of the incident will be cited along\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith our commentary on the Text, which honorably absolved\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Aishah from the blame. But here we would only want\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto point out the enormity of the mischief that was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tengineered by Abdullah bin Ubayy: \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt implied an attack on the honor of the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet and Hadrat Abu Bakr Siddiq.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHe meant to undermine the high moral superiority\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhich was the greatest asset of the Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMovement.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHe intended to ignite civil war between the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhajirs and the Ansar, and between Aus and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tKhazraj, the two clans of the Ansar.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Topics </div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah and vv. 28-73 of Surah Al-Ahzab (of which this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the sequel) were sent down to strengthen the moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfront, which at that time was the main target of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattack, vv. 28-73 of Al-Ahzab were sent down concerning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet's marriage with Hadrat Zainab, and on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe occasion of the second attack (the \"Slander\" about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Aishah), Surah An-Nur was sent down to repair the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcracks that had appeared in the unity of the Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCommunity.

This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tshould have been enough to convince you that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccusation was not worth your consideration; nay,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tit was not even conceivable.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThose who spread news and evil rumors and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpropagate wickedness in the Muslim Community,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdeserve punishment and not encouragement.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA general principle was laid down that relations\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin the Muslim Community should be based on good\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfaith and not on suspicion: everyone should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttreated as innocent unless he is proved to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tguilty and vice versa.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe people were forbidden to enter the houses of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tothers unceremoniously and were instructed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttake permission for this.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBoth men and women were instructed to lower their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgaze and forbidden to cast glances or make eyes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tat each other.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWomen were enjoined to cover their heads and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreasts even inside their houses.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWomen were forbidden to appear with make-up\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore other men except their servants or such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trelatives with whom their marriage is prohibited.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThey were enjoined to hide their make-ups when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthey went out of their houses, and even forbidden\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto put on jingling ornaments, while they moved\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tout of their houses.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMarriage was encouraged and enjoined even for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tslaves and slave girls, for unmarried people help\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tspread indecency.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe institution of slavery was discouraged and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe owners and other people were enjoined to give\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfinancial help to the slaves to earn their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfreedom under the law of Mukatabat.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProstitution by slave girls was forbidden in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst instance, for prostitution in Arabia was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconfined to this class alone.

Incidentally,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis teaches us how to deal with such provocative\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmischiefs coolly, wisely and generously. At the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime, it is a clear proof that this is not the word of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Muhammad (Allah's peace and blessings be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim) but of a Being Who is observing all human conditions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand affairs from the highest level, and guiding mankind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout any personal prejudices, feelings and leanings.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHad this been the word of the Hoiy Prophet; there would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been at least some tinge of natural bitterness in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspite of his great generosity and forbearance, for it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut human that a noble man naturally become enraged when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this own honor is attacked in this mean manner.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

According to Ibn Abbas, Surah Ta Ha was revealed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst, then Surah Al Waqiah, and then Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAsh-Shu'araa.(Ruh-ul-Ma'ani, Vol. xIx, p. 64). About\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Ta Ha it is well known that it had been revealed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore Hadrat Umar embraced Islam.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Subject Matter and Topics</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe background of the Surah is that the disbelievers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah were persistently refusing, on one pretext or the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother, to accept the message of Islam given by the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet. Sometimes they would say that he did not show\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem any sign to convince them of his Prophethood;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsometimes they would brand him as a poet or a sorcerer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand mock his message; and sometimes they would ridicule\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Mission, saying that his followers were either a few\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfoolish youth, or the poor people and slaves whereas,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey argued, if his Mission had really some value for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople, the nobles and the elders would have accepted it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst. Thus, while on the one hand, the Holy Prophet was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecoming wearied by his efforts to show them rationally\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe errors of their creeds and prove the truth of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDoctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter, the disbelievers,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the other, were never tired of adopting one kind of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobduracy after the other. This state of affairs was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcausing great anguish and grief to the Holy Prophet.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSuch were the conditions when this Surah was revealed. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegins with words of consolation to the Holy Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timplying, \"Why do you fret for their sake? If these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople have not believed in you, it is not because they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave not seen any Sign, but because they are obdurate.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey will not listen to reason, they want to see a Sign\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich makes them bow their heads in humility. When this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSign is shown in due course of time, they will themselves\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealize that what was being presented to them was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTruth.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this introduction, till verse 191, one and the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheme has been presented continuously, and it is said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The whole earth abounds in such Signs as can guide a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseeker after truth to Reality, but the stubborn and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmisguided people have never believed even after seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Signs, whether these were the Signs of the natural\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tphenomena or the miracles of the Prophets. These wretched\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople have stubbornly adhered to their erroneous creeds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttill the Divine scourge actually overtook them.\" It is to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tillustrate this that the history of seven of the ancient\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribes has been told, who persisted in disbelief just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike the disbelievers of Makkah. In this connection, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowing points have been stressed:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Signs are of two kinds:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe mentality of the disbeliever has been the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsame throughout the ages; their arguments and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir objections, and their excuses and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsubterfuges for not believing have been similar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand ultimately the fates that they met have also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen the same. Likewise, the Prophets in every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tage presented the same teachings, their personal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcharacter and their reasoning and arguments\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst their opponents were the same, and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twere all similarly blessed with mercy by Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlmighty. Both these patterns of behavior and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconduct are found in history, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers could themselves see as to which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trespective patterns they and the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbelonged.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah is All Mighty, All Powerful and All\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMerciful at the same time.

When in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe heart of your hearts you yourselves believe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Revelations of the Quran have nothing in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcommon with sorcery and poetry, then you should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tknow that you are being cruel and unjust, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twill certainly meet the doom meant for the cruel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand unjust.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol type='A'>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthose which are scattered all over the earth, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tby seeing which an intelligent person can judge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfor himself whether what the Prophet is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpresenting is the Truth or not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthose which were seen by Pharaoh and his people,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNoah's people, the Ad and the Thamud, Lot's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople and the people of Aiykah.

According to Ibn Abbas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Jabir bin Zaid, \"First the Surah Ash Shuaraa was sent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown, then the Surah An Naml and then Al-Qasas.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Topics</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Surah consists of two discourses, the first from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeginning of the Surah to the end of verse 58, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecond from verse 59 to the end of the Surah. The theme\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the first discourse is that only those people can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbenefit from the guidance of the Quran and become worthy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the good promises made in it, who accept the realities\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich this Book presents as the basic realities of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuniverse, and then follow up their belief with obedience\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand submission in their practical lives as well. But the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreatest hindrance for man to follow this way is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdenial of the Hereafter. For it makes him irresponsible,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tselfish and given to worldly life, which in turn makes it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timpossible for him to submit himself before God and to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept the moral restrictions on his lusts and desires.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this introduction three types of character have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen presented.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe first type is characterized by Pharaoh and the chiefs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Thamud and the rebels of the people of Lot, who were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall heedless of the accountability of the Hereafter and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad consequently become the slaves of the world. These\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople did not believe even after seeing the miracles.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRather they turned against those who invited them to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoodness and piety. They persisted in their evil ways\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich are held in abhorrence by every sensible person.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey did not heed the admonition even until a moment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore they were overtaken by the scourge of Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe second type of character is of the Prophet Solomon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him), who had been blessed by God with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twealth and kingdom and grandeur to an extent undreamt of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the chiefs of the disbelievers of Makkah. But, since\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the regarded himself as answerable before God and had the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfeeling that whatever he had was only due to Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbounty, he had adopted the attitude of obedience before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHim and there was no tinge of vanity in his character.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe third type is of the queen of Sheba, who ruled over a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost wealthy and well known people in the history of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia. She possessed all those means of life, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould cause a person to become vain and conceited. Her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twealth and possessions far exceeded the wealth and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossessions of the Quraish. Then she professed shirk,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich was not only an ancestral way of life with her, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshe had to follow it in order to maintain her position as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta ruler. Therefore, it was much more difficult for her to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgive up shirk and adopt the way of tauhid than it could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe for a common mushrik. But when the Truth became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevident to her, nothing could stop her from accepting it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHer deviation was, in fact, due to her being born and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrought up in a polytheistic environment and not because\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof her being a slave to her lusts and desires. Her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconscience was not devoid of the sense of accountability\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore God.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the second discourse, at the outset, attention has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen drawn to some of the most glaring and visible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealities of the universe, and the disbelievers of Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been asked one question after the other to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teffect: \"Do these realities testify to the creed of shirk\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich you are following, or to the truth of tauhid to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich the Quran invites you?\" After this the real malady\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the disbelievers has been pointed out, saying, \"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthing which has blinded them and made them insensitive to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery glaring reality is their denial of the Hereafter.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis same thing has rendered every matter and affair of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife non-serious for them. For, when according to them,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teverything has to become dust ultimately, and the whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstruggle of life is purposeless and without an object\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore it, the truth and falsehood are equal and alike.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, the question whether one's system of life is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbased on the right or wrong foundations, becomes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaningless for him.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut the discourse, as outlined above, is not meant to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdissuade the Prophet and the Muslims from calling the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobdurate and heedless people to the way of tauhid; it is,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin fact, intended to arouse them from their slumber. That\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis why in vv. 67-93 certain things have been said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepeatedly in order to produce in the people a sense of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hereafter, to warn them of the consequences of being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theedless of it, and to convince them of its coining, like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan eye witness of something, who convinces the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson of it, who has not seen it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, the real invitation of the Quran, that is,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe invitation to serve One Allah alone, has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresented in a concise but forceful manner, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople warned that accepting it would be to their own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadvantage and rejecting it to their own disadvantage. For\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif they deferred their faith until they saw those Signs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof God after the appearance of which they would be left\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith no choice but to believe and submit, they should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbear in mind the fact that that would be the time of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjudgment and believing then would be of no avail.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

    "Text": "<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Name</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Surah takes its name from verse 25 in which the word\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Qasas occurs. Lexically, qasas means to relate events\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin their proper sequence. Thus, from the viewpoint of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaning too, this word can be a suitable title for this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah, for in it the detailed story of the Prophet Moses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been related.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Period of Revelation</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs already mentioned in the introduction to Surah An\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNaml, according to Ibn Abbas and Jabir bin Zaid, Surahs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAsh-Shuaraa, An-Naml and Al-Qasas were sent down one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the other. The language, the style and the theme\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso show that the period of the revelation of these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree Surahs is nearly the same. Another reason for their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclose resemblance is that the different parts of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Moses story as mentioned in these surahs together\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake up a complete story. In Surah Ash-Shuaraa, excusing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself for not accepting the office of Prophethood the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Moses submits, \"The people of Pharaoh have the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharge of a crime against me; therefore, I fear that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill put me to death.\" Then, when he goes before Pharaoh,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe latter says, \"Did we not bring you up as a child in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tour house? You lived quite a few years of your life among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tus, and then you did what you did.\" Nothing more of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been mentioned there, but in this Surah the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetails have been supplied. Similarly, in Surah An-Naml\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe story starts abruptly from the time when the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMoses was journeying with his family and suddenly saw a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfire at a distance. In that Surah nothing has been said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout the nature of his journey, or the place he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcoming from, or his destination, but this Surah supplies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall the necessary details. Thus, the three Surahs read\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttogether complete the story of the Prophet Moses (Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace be upon him).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Topics</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe main theme is to remove the doubts and objections\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat were being raised against the Prophethood of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessings) and to invalidate the excuses which were being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffered for not believing in him.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor this purpose, first the story of the Prophet Moses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been related, which, by analogy with the period of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation, impresses the following points in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlistener's mind automatically:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst, Allah provides the means and motives of whatever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe wills to do, in imperceptible ways. Thus, Allah so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarranged things that the child through whom Pharaoh had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto be removed from power, was bred and brought up in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\town house, and he could not know whom he was fostering.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWho can then fight God and frustrate Him by his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmachinations.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSecondly, Prophethood is not granted to a person amid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfestivities by issuing a proclamation from the earth and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theavens. You wonder how Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) has been blessed with Prophethood unexpectedly,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall of a sudden, but Moses whom you yourselves\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacknowledge as a Prophet (v. 48) had also become a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet unexpectedly, while on a journey, and nobody had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknown what event had occurred in the desolation at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfoot of Mt. Sinai. Even Moses himself did not know a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmoment before what he was going to be blessed with. He,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin fact, had gone to bring a piece of the fire but had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturned with the gift of Prophethood\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThirdly, the person from whom Allah wants to take some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tservice comes out without any army and armor and without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan apparent helper or force at his back, yet he puts to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trout much stronger and better equipped opponents. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontrast that existed between the strengths of Moses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him) and Pharaoh was much more prominent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand glaring than that which existed between Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him) and the quraish; yet the world knows\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho had come out victorious in the end and who had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trouted.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFourthly, you refer to Moses again and again and say,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Why has Muhammad not been given the same which was given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Moses? i.e. miracles of the staff, the shining land,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tetc. as if to suggest that you would readily believe only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif you were shown the kind of the miracles that were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshown by Moses to Pharaoh. But do you know what sort of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponse was made by those who were shown those miracles?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey had not believed even after seeing the miracles, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad only said, \"This is magic\", for they were involved in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstubbornness and hostility to the Truth. The same malady\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafflicts you today. Will you believe only when you are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshown the same kind of miracles? Then, do you know what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfate the disbelievers had met even after seeing the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmiracles? They were annihilated by Allah. Do you now wish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto meet the same doom by asking for the miracles in your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobstinacy?\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese were the things which were automatically impressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the mind of every listener who heard this story in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpagan environment of Makkah, for a similar conflict was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoing on at that time between the Holy Prophet and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers of Makkah as had already taken place between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet Moses and Pharaoh before. This was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbackground against which the story of the Prophet Moses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas narrated so that a perfect analogy was established\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tautomatically in every detail between the conditions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevailing then in Makkah and those existing in the time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Prophet Moses. Then, from verse 43 onward the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscourse turns to the real theme.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the first place, the narration of a two thousand year\\n\\t\\t\\t\\told historical event by the Holy Prophet with such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccuracy and detail, is presented as a proof of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood although he was illiterate and the people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this city and clan knew full well that he had no access to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany source of such information as they could point out.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen his appointment as a Prophet is put forward as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's mercy to them, for they were heedless and Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad made this arrangement for their guidance. Then their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toft-repeated objection, \"Why has not this Prophet brought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe miracles which Moses had brought?\" has been answered.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is said to them, \"How can you be justified in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemanding miracles from this Prophet when you did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve in Moses either, who, as you yourselves\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacknowledge, had brought miracles from God? You can still\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsee the truth only if you do not serve your lusts and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhims. But if you remained afflicted with this malady,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou would never see it even though you were shown any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkind of miracles.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen the disbelievers of Makkah have been warned and put\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto shame for an event that occurred in those very days.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSome Christians had come to Makkah and embraced Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen they heard the Quran from the Holy Prophet. Instead\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof learning any lesson from this the Makkans were so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupset at this that their leader, Abu Jahl, disgraced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose people publicly. In conclusion, the excuse that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers put forward for not believing in the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet has been dealt with. What they feared was this:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"If we give up the polytheistic creed of the Arabs and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept the doctrine of Tauhid instead, this will put an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tend to our supremacy in the religious, political and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teconomic fields, which, in turn, will destroy our\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tposition of the most influential tribe of Arabia and we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshall be left with no refuge anywhere in the land.\" As\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis was the real motive of the chiefs of the Quraish for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir antagonism towards the Truth, and their doubts and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobjections were only the pretenses, which they invented\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto deceive the common people, Allah has dealt with these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfully till the end of the Surah, considered each aspect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof these in a wise manner and offered the remedy for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir basic ailment due to which those people judged the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTruth and falsehood only from the viewpoint of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworldly interests.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Some commentators have opined that since it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentions the hypocrites, and hypocrisy appeared in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah, the first ten verses of this Surah were revealed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat Madinah and the rest of it at Makkah; whereas the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople whose hypocrisy has been mentioned here are those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho had adopted a hypocritical way of life because they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere afraid of the oppression and extreme physical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttorture to which the Muslims were being subjected by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers. Evidently, this kind of hypocrisy could be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere only at Makkah and not at Madinah. Similarly, some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother commentators, seeing that in this Surah the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been exhorted to migrate, have regarded it as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlast Surah to be revealed at Makkah, whereas the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad migrated to Habash even before their migration to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah. These opinions are not based on any tradition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut on the internal evidence of the subject matter, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis internal evidence, when considered against the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubject matter of the Surah as a whole, points to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions prevailing in the time of the migration to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHabash and not to the last stage at Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA perusal of the Surah shows that the period of its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation was the period of extreme persecution of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims at Makkah. The disbelievers were opposing and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfighting Islam tooth and nail and the new converts were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing subjected to the severest oppression. Such were the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions when Allah sent down this Surah to strengthen\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand encourage the sincere Muslims as well as to put to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshame those who were showing weakness of the faith.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBesides, the disbelievers of Makkah have been threatened\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand warned not to invite for themselves the fate that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tantagonists of the Truth have been experiencing in every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tage.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this connection, the questions that some young men\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere facing in those days, have also been answered. For\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance, their parents were urging them to abandon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad (may Allah's peace be upon him), and return to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir ancestral religion, for they argued: \"The Quran in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich you have put your faith, regards the rights of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparents as the uppermost; therefore, listen to what we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay; otherwise you will be working against the dictates\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof your own Faith.\" This has been answered in verse 8.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSimilarly, the people of some clans said to the new\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconverts to Islam, \"Leave the question of punishments,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tetc., to us.

If God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseizes you in the Hereafter, we will come forward and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay, 'Lord, these people are innocent: we had forced them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto give up the Faith; therefore, seize us'.\" This has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen dealt with, in vv. 12-13.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe stories mentioned in this Surah also impress the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoint mostly, as if to say, \"Look at the Prophets of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpast: they were made to suffer great hardships and were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreated cruelly for long periods.

Let us have a look at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe historical background relevant to the verses.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEight years before the Holy Prophet's advent as a Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Byzantine Emperor Maurice was overthrown by Phocus,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho captured the throne and became king. Phocus first got\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Emperor's five sons executed in front of him, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen got the Emperor also killed and hung their heads in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta thoroughfare in Constantinople. A few days after this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the had the empress and her three daughters also put to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath. The event provided Khusrau Parvez, the Sassanid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tking of Iran; a good moral excuse to attack Byzantium.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor Emperor Maurice had been his benefactor; with his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelp he had got the throne of Iran. Therefore, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeclared that he would avenge his godfather's and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchildren's murder upon Phocus, the usurper. So, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstarted war against Byzantium in 603 A. D. and within a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfew years, putting the Phocus armies to rout in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuccession, he reached Edessa (modern, Urfa) in Asia\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMinor, on the one hand, and Aleppo and Antioch in Syria,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the other. When the Byzantine ministers saw that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPhocus could not save the country, they sought the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfrican governor's help, who sent his son, Heraclius, to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConstantinople with a strong fleet. Phocus was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timmediately deposed and Heraclius made emperor. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreated Phocus as he had treated Maurice. This happened\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin 610 A.D., the year the Holy Prophet was appointed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe moral excuse for which Khusrau Parvez had started the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twar was no more valid after the deposition and death of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPhocus. Had the object of his war really been to avenge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe murder of his ally on Phocus for his cruelty, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould have come to terms with the new Emperor after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath of Phocus. But he continued the war, and gave it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe color of a crusade between Zoroastrianism and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChristianity. The sympathies of the Christian sects (i.e.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNestorians and Jacobians, etc.) which had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcommunicated by the Roman ecclesiastical authority and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttyrannized for years also went with the Magian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Zoroastrian) invaders, and the Jews also joined hands\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith them; so much so that the number of the Jews who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenlisted in Khusrau's army rose up to 26,000.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHeraclius could not stop this storm. The very first news\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he received from the East after ascending the throne\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas that of the Iranian occupation of Antioch. After this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDamascus fell in 613 A.D. Then in 614 A.D. the Iranians\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccupying Jerusalem played havoc with the Christian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld. Ninety thousand Christians were massacred and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Sepulcher was desecrated. The Original Cross on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich, according to the Christian belief, Jesus had died\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas seized and carried to Mada'in. The chief priest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZacharia was taken prisoner and all the important\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchurches of the city were destroyed. How puffed up was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhusrau Parvez at this victory can be judged from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tletter that he wrote to Heraclius from Jerusalem. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrote: \"From Khusrau, the greatest of all gods, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaster of the whole world : To Heraclius, his most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twretched and most stupid servant: 'You say that you have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrust in your Lord. why didn't then your Lord save\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJerusalem from me?'\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWithin a year after this victory the Iranian armies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover-ran Jordan, Palestine and the whole of the Sinai\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPeninsula, and reached the frontiers of Egypt. In those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvery days another conflict of a far greater historical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequence was going on in Makkah. The believers in One\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod, under the leadership of the Prophet Muhammad (may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace be upon him), were fighting for their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texistence against the followers of shirk under the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommand of the chiefs of the Quraish, and the conflict\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad reached such a stage that in 615 A.D., a substantial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnumber of the Muslims had to leave their homes and take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefuge with the Christian kingdom of Habash, which was an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tally of the Byzantine Empire. In those days the Sassanid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvictories against Byzantium were the talk of the town,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the pagans of Makkah were delighted and were taunting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims to the effect: \"Look the fire worshipers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIran are winning victories and the Christian believers in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRevelation and Prophethood are being routed everywhere.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLikewise, we, the idol worshipers of Arabia, will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texterminate you and your religion.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese were the conditions when this Surah of the Quran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas sent down, and in it a prediction was made,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying:\"The Romans have been vanquished in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneighbouring land and within a few years after their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefeat, they shall be victorious. And it will be the day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen the believers will rejoice in the victory granted by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah.\" It contained not one but two predictions: First,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Romans shall be Victorious; and second, the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso shall win a victory at the same time. Apparently,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere was not a remote chance of the fulfillment of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teither prediction in the next few years. On the one hand,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere were a handful of the Muslims, who were being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeaten and tortured in Makkah, and even till eight years\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter this prediction there appeared no chance of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvictory and domination. On the other, the Romans were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlosing more and more ground every next day. By 619 A.D.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe whole of Egypt had passed into Sassanid hands and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMagian armies had reached as far as Tripoli. In Asia\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMinor they beat and pushed back the Romans to Bosporus,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand in 617 A.D. they captured Chalcedon (modern, Kadikoy)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjust opposite Constantinople. The Emperor sent an envoy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Khusrau, praying that he was ready to have peace on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany terms, but he replied, \"I shall not give protection\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the emperor until he is brought in chains before me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand gives up obedience to his crucified god and adopts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubmission to the fire god.\" At last, the Emperor became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso depressed by defeat that he decided to leave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConstantinople and shift to Carthage (modern, Tunis). In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshort, as the British historian Gibbon says, even seven\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto eight years after this prediction of the Quran, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions were such that no one could even imagine that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Byzantine Empire would ever gain an upper hand over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIran. Not to speak of gaining domination, no one could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thope that the Empire, under the circumstances, would even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurvive.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen these verses of the Quran were sent down, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers of Makkah made great fun of them, and Ubayy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Khalaf bet Hadrat Abu Bakr ten camels if the Romans\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecame victorious within three years. When the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet came to know of the bet, he said, \"The Quran has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tused the words bid i sinin, and the word bid in Arabic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapplies to a number up to ten. Therefore, make the bet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor ten years and increase the number of camels to a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thundred.\" So, Hadrat Abu Bakr spoke to Ubayy again and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbet a hundred camels for ten years.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn 622 A.D. as the Holy Prophet migrated to Madinah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmperor Heraclius set off quietly for Trabzon from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConstantinople via the Black Sea and started preparations\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto attack Iran from rear. For this he asked the Church\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor money, and Pope Sergius lent him the Church\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcollections on interest, in a bid to save Christianity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Zoroastrianism. Heraclius started his counter attack\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin 623 A.D. from Armenia. Next year, in 624 A.D., he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentered Azerbaijan and destroyed Clorumia, the birthplace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Zoroaster, and ravaged the principal fire temple of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIran. Great are the powers of Allah, this was the very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyear when the Muslims achieved a decisive victory at Badr\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the first time against the mushriks. Thus both the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpredictions made in Surah Rum were fulfilled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimultaneously within the stipulated period of ten years.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Byzantine forces continued to press the Iranians hard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand in the decisive battle at Nineveh (627 A.D.) they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdealt them the hardest blow. They captured the royal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresidence of Dastagerd, and then pressing forward reached\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright opposite to Ctesiphon, capital of Iran in those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays. In 628 A. D. in an internal revolt, Khusrau Parvez\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas imprisoned and 18 of his sons were executed in front\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof him and a few days later he himself died in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprison. This was the year when the peace treaty of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHudaibiya was concluded, which the Quran has termed as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"the supreme victory\", and in this very year Khusrau's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tson, Qubad II, gave up all the occupied Roman\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterritories, restored the True Cross and made peace with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tByzantium. In 628 A.D., the Emperor himself went to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJerusalem to instal the \"Holy Cross\" in its place, and in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same year the Holy Prophet entered Makkah for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst time after the Hijrah to perform the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUmrah-tul-Qada.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this no one could have any doubt about the truth of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe prophecy of the Quran, with the result that most of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Arab polytheists accepted Islam. The heirs of Ubayy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Khalaf lost their bet and had to give a hundred\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcamels to Hadrat Abu Bakr Siddiq. He took them before the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet, who ordered that they be given away in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharity, because the bet had been made at a time when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgambling had not yet been forbidden by the Shariah; now\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit was forbidden. Therefore, the bet was allowed to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccepted from the belligerent disbelievers, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstruction given that it should be given away in charity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand should not be brought in personal use.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe discourse begins with the theme that the Romans have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen overcome and the people the world over think that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe empire is about to collapse, but the fact is that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithin a few years the tables will be turned and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvanquished will again become victorious.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis introductory theme contains the great truth that man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis accustomed to seeing only what is apparent and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuperficial. That which is behind the apparent and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuperficial he does not know. When in the petty matters\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof life, this habit to see only the apparent and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuperficial can lead man to misunderstandings and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmiscalculations, and when he is liable to make wrong\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testimates only due to lack of knowledge about \"what will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappen tomorrow\", how stupendous will be his error if he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trisks his whole life-activity by placing reliance only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon what is visible and apparent with respect to his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworldly life as a whole. Then, from the question of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconflict between Byzantium and Iran the direction of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscourse turns to the theme of the Hereafter, and as far\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas verse 27, man has been made to understand in different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tways that the Hereafter is possible as well as rational\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand necessary; then for the sake of keeping the system of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this life also stable and balanced it is absolutely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary that he should plan and order his present life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the faith in the Hereafter; otherwise he will commit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same error as has always been the result of placing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone's reliance only upon the apparent and the visible.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this connection, the Signs of the universe which have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen presented as evidence to prove the doctrine of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter are precisely the same which support the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoctrine of Tauhid. Therefore from verse 28 onward, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscourse turns to the affirmation of Tauhid and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefutation of shirk, and it is stressed that the natural\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tway of life for man is none else but to serve One God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texclusively. Shirk is opposed to the nature of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuniverse as to the nature of man. Therefore, whenever man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas adopted this deviation, chaos has resulted. Again\\n\\t\\t\\t\\there, an allusion has been made to the great chaos that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad gripped the world on account of the war between the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo major powers of the time, and it has been indicated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat this chaos too, is the result of shirk, and all the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnations who were ever involved in mischief and chaos in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe history of mankind were also mushriks.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, a parable has been presented to make the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople understand that just as dead earth comes to life,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall of a sudden, by a shower of rain sent by God and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tswells with vegetation and plant life, so is the case\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the dead humanity. When God sends a shower of His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmercy in the form of Revelation and Prophethood, it also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgives a new life to mankind and causes it to grow and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdevelop and flourish. Therefore: \"If you take full\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadvantage of this opportunity, the barren land of Arabia\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill bloom by Allah's mercy and the whole advantage will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe your. But if you do not take advantage of it, you will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tharm only your selves. Then no regret will avail and no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topportunity will be provided to make amends.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

The same thing has been said in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Al-Ankabut, which indicates that both these Surahs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere sent down in the same period. A study of the style\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand subject matter of the two Surahs on the whole,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, shows that Surah Luqman was sent down earlier,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor one does not see any sign of the antagonism in its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbackground though, contrary to this, while studying Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Ankabut one can clearly feel that the Muslims were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing severely persecuted during the period of its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this Surah the people have been made to under- stand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe meaninglessness and absurdity of shirk and the truth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand reasonableness of Tauhid, and they have been invited\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto give up blind imitation of their forefathers, consider\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith a cool mind the teachings which the Prophet Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) is presenting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the Lord of the worlds, and see with open eyes the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanifest Signs found in the universe around them and in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir own selves, which bear evidence to its truth.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this connection, it has also been pointed out that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis is not a new teaching which might have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresented in the world, or in the land of Arabia, for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst time, and with which the people might be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunfamiliar.

The disbelievers of Makkah, when they talked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Holy Prophet in private, said to one another,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"This person is forging strange things, sometimes he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgives news of what will happen after death.

Then they have been told: It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis Allah's supreme Mercy that He does not seize man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timmediately for his errors to punish him finally and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecisively but warns him beforehand by afflicting him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith small troubles and hardships and calamities and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlosses and strokes of misfortune so that he may wake up\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand take admonition.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen it is said: \"This is not the first and novel event\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof its kind that a Book has been sent down upon a man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom God.

Their high\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate of morale can be judged from the events that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurred in the first year after Uhud. Hardly two months\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad passed then the tribe of Bani Asad of Najd began to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake preparations for a raid on Madinah, and the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet had to despatch an expedition under Abu Salamah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto counteract them.

Accordingly six of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Companions were allowed to accompany them for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurpose. But when they reached Raji (a place between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRabigh and Jeddah), they summoned Hudhail against them,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho killed four of the Companions, and took the other two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Hadrat Khubaib bin Adi and Hadrat Zaid bin ad-Dathinnah)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Makkah and sold them to the enemy. Then in the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmonth of Safar, on the request of a chief of Bani Amir,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet sent another deputation of 40 (according\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto others, 70) preachers, consisting of the Ansar young\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen, to Najd. But they were also betrayed. The people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUsayyah and Ri'l and Dhakwan, tribes of Bani Sulaim,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurrounded them suddenly at Bir Maunah and slew all of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem. Meanwhile the Jewish tribe of Bani an-Nadir of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah, getting encouragement, continued to commit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreaches of the treaties; so much so that in Rabi'ul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAwwal, A.H. 4, they plotted against the life of the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet himself. Then in Jamadi al-Ula, A.H. 4, Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThalbah and Bani Muharib, the two tribes of Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGhatafan, started making preparations to attack Madinah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Holy Prophet had to go to punish them. Thus,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter their setback at Uhud, the Muslims went on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tencountering repercussions continuously for seven to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teight months.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, it was the Holy Prophet's determination and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twisdom and his great Companions' spirit of sacrifice that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchanged these adverse conditions completely within a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshort span of time. The economic boycott by the Arabs had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade life hard for the people of Madinah. All the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpolytheistic tribes around Madinah were becoming\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trebellious. Inside Madinah itself the Jews and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites were beat upon mischief. But the successive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsteps taken by a handful of the sincere Muslims, under\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe leadership of the Holy Prophet, not only restored the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timage of strength of Islam in Arabia but also increased\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit manifold.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Raids Preceding the Battle of the Trench</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe first such step was taken immediately after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBattle of Uhud. The very next day when quite a large\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnumber of Muslims lay wounded and the martyrdom of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnear and dear ones was being mourned in many houses, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet himself was injured and sad at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmartyrdom of his uncle, Hadrat Hamzah, he called out to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe devoted servants of Islam to accompany him in pursuit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the pagans so as to deter them from returning and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattacking Madinah again. The Holy Prophet's assessment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas absolutely correct. He knew that, although the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish had retreated without taking any advantage of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir almost complete victory, they would certainly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregret their folly when they would halt and consider the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole matter coolly on the way, and would return to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattack Madinah again. Therefore, he decided to go in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpursuit of them, and 630 of of the Muslims at once\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvolunteered to accompany him. When they reached Hamra\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Asad on the way to Makkah and camped there for three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays, the Holy Prophet came to know through a sympathetic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnon-Muslim that Abu Sufyan had stayed at Ar-Rauha, 36\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmiles short of Madinah, with an army 2,978 strong: they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere regretting their error and were, in fact, planning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto return and attack Madinah once again. But when they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theard that the Holy Prophet was coming in pursuit of them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith an army, they lost heart and gave up their plan.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThus, not only were the Quraish deterred by this action\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut the other enemies living around Madinah also realized\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Muslims were being led by a person who was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thighly well informed, wise and resolute, and that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims were ever ready to lay down their lives at his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommand. (For further details, see Introduction to Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl Imran.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen as soon as the Bani Asad started making preparations\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor a raid on Madinah, the Holy Prophet's secret agents\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgave him timely information about their intention. Thus,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore they could come in force to attack Madina, he sent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan army 150 strong, under Hadrat Abu Salamah (the first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thusband of Hadrat Umm Salamah) to punish them. They took\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBani Asad by surprise, who fled in panic leaving all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir possessions behind, which fell into the Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thands.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this came the turn of the Bani an-Nadir. The day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey plotted against the life of the Holy Prophet, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe secret was disclosed, the Holy Prophet ordered them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto leave Madinah within ten days and warned that anyone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho remained behind after that would be put to death.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdullah bin Ubayy, the chief of the hypocrites of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah, encouraged them to defy the order and refuse to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleave Madinah. He even promised to help them with 2,000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen, and assured them that the Bani Ghatafan from Najd\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso would come to their aid. Accordingly, the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan-Nadir sent word that they would not leave no matter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat the Holy Prophet might do.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs soon as the time limit of ten days come to an end, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet laid siege to their quarters, but none of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir supporters had the courage to come to their rescue.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt last, they surrendered on condition that every three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof them would be allowed to load a camel with whatever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey could carry and go away leaving the rest of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossessions behind. Thus, the whole suburbs of the city\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich were inhabited by the Bani an-Nadir, and their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgardens and their fortresses and other properties fell to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims, and the people of this treacherous tribe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecame scattered in Khaiber, Wad il Qura and Syria.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen the Holy Prophet turned his attention to the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGhatafan, who were preparing for a war against Madinah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe took 400 of the Muslims and overtook them at Dhat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tar-Riqa. They were so taken by surprise that they fled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir houses without a struggle and took refuge in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmountains.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this in Shaban A.H. 4, the Holy Prophet went forth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Badr to fight Abu Sufyan. At the end of the Battle of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUhud, he had challenged the Holy Prophet and the Muslims,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying, \"We shall again meet you in combat at Badr next\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyear.\" In reply the Holy Prophet announced through a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanion: \"All right: we accept your challenge.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccordingly, at the appointed time he reached Badr with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t1,500 of the Muslims. From the other side, Abu Sufyan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleft Makkah with an army of 2,000 men, but could not have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe courage to march beyond Marr-az-Zahran (modern, Wadi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFatimah). The Holy Prophet waited for him at Badr for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teight days; the Muslims during these days did profitable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbusiness with a trading party. This incident helped more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan restore the image of strength of the Muslims that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad been tarnished at Uhud. It also made the whole of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia realize that the Quraish alone could no longer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresist Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessings).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis image and position of the Muslims was further\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrengthened by another event. Dumat al-Jandal (modern,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Jauf) was an important place at the border between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia and Syria. When the caravans of the Arabs, trading\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween Iraq in the south and Syria and Egypt in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnorth, passed that way, they were harassed and looted by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe natives. In Rabi al-Awwal, A.H. 5, the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself went to punish them with an army of 1,000 men.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey could not muster up courage to come out and fight\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim and, therefore, fled the place. This caused the whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof northern Arabia to dread the power of Islam, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribes began to realize that the great power emerging\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Al-Madinah was formidable and could no longer be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresisted by one or a few of the tribes.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>The Battle of the Trench</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSuch were the conditions when the Battle of the Trench\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttook place. It was in fact a combined raid by many of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArab tribes, who wanted to crush the power of Madinah. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad been instigated by the leaders of the Bani an-Nadir,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho had settled in Khaiber after their banishment from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah. They went round to the Quraish and Ghatafan and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHudhail and many other tribes and induced them to gather\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall their forces together and attack Madinah jointly.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThus, in Shawwal, A.H. 5, an unprecedented large army of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Arab tribes marched against the small city of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah. From the north came Jews of Bani an-Nadir and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBani Qainuqa who after their banishment from Madinah, had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettled in Khaiber and Wad il Qura. From the east\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadvanced the tribes of Ghatafan, Bani Sulaim, Fazarah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMurrah, Ashja, Sad, Asad, etc. and from the south the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish, along with a large force of their allies.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTogether they numbered from ten to twelve thousand men.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHad it been a sudden attack, it would have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisastrous. But the Holy Prophet was not unaware of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Madinah. His intelligence men and the sympathizers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Islamic movement and the people influenced by it were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresent in every tribe, who kept him informed of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenemy's movements. Even before the enemy could reach his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcity, he got a trench dug out on the north-west of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah in six days, and having the Mount Salat their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tback, took up a defensive position with 3,000 men in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprotection of the Trench. To the south of Madinah there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere many gardens (even now there are) so that it could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot be attacked from that side. To the east there are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlava rocks which are impassable for a large army. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame is the case with the south western side. The attack,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore, could be made only from the eastern and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twestern sides of the Uhud, which the Holy Prophet had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecured by digging a trench. The disbelievers were not at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall aware that they would have to counter the trench\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toutside Madinah. This kind of a defensive stratagem was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunknown to the Arabs. Thus, they had to lay a long siege\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin winter for which they had not come prepared.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, only one alternative remained with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers: to incite the Jewish tribe of Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraizah, who inhabited the southeastern part of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcity, to rebellion. As the Muslims had entered a treaty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith them that in case of an attack on Madinah they would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefend the city along with them, the Muslims had made no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefensive arrangement there and had even sent their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfamilies to take shelter in the forts situated on that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tside. The invaders perceived this weakness of the Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefenses. They sent Huyayy bin Akhtab, the Jewish leader\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Bani an-Nadir, to the Bani Quraizah so as to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinduce them to break the treaty and join the war. In the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeginning, they refused to oblige and said that they had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta treaty with Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad faithfully abided by it and given them no cause for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplaint. But when Ibn Akhtab said to them, \"Look, I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave summoned the united force of entire Arabia against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim: this is a perfect opportunity to get rid of him. If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou lose it, you will never have another opportunity,\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe anti Islamic Jewish mind prevailed over every moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsideration and the Bani Quraizah were persuaded to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak the treaty.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Holy Prophet received news of this. He at once told\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSad bin Ubadah, Sad bin Muadh, Abdullah bin Rawahah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhawwat bin Jubair, chiefs of the Ansar, to go and find\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout the truth. He advised them that if they found Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraizah still loyal to the treaty, they should return\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand say so openly before the Muslim army; however, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey found that they were bent upon treachery they should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly inform him so that the common Muslims would not be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisheartened. On reaching there the Companions found the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBani Quraizah fully bent on mischief. They told the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions openly, \"There is no agreement and no treaty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween us and Muhammad.\" At this they returned to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic army and submitted their report to the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, saying, \"'Adal and Qarah.\" That is, \"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraizah are bent upon doing what the Adal and Qarah had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdone with the preachers of Islam at Raji.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis news spread among the Muslims and caused great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsternation among them, for they had been encircled and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir city had been endangered on the side where there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texisted no defensive arrangement and where they had also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsent their families to take shelter in the forts. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfurther increased the activities of the hypocrites and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey started making psychological attacks to break the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmorale of the Muslims. One said, \"How strange!We were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing foretold that the lands of Caesar and Chosroes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould fall to us, but here we are that not one of us can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgo out even to relieve himself.\" Another one asked for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermission to leave his post at the Trench so that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould go and protect his own house which was in danger.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnother one started making secret propaganda to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teffect: \"Settle your affair with the invaders yourselves\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand hand over Muhammad to them.\" This was a highly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcritical hour of trial, which exposed every person who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tharbored any hypocrisy in his heart. Only the true and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsincere Muslims remained firm and steadfast in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresolve and devotion.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Holy Prophet at that critical moment initiated peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnegotiations with the Ban Ghatafan and tried to persuade\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem to accept one third of the fruit harvest of Madinah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand withdraw. But when he asked Sad bin Ubadah and Sad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Muadh, chief of the Ansar, for their opinion about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe conditions of peace, they said, \"O Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah: Is it your personal wish that we should agree on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese conditions, or is it Allah's Command that we have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno option but to accept it?Or, are you giving this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproposal only in order to save us from the enemy?\" The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet replied, \"I am proposing this only to save\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou: I see that the whole of Arabia has formed a united\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfront against you. I want to divide the enemy.\" At this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe two chiefs protested; saying, \"Sir, if you want to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconclude this pact for our sake, kindly forget it. These\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribes could not subdue us under tribute when we were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpolytheists. Now that we have the honor of believing in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah and His Messenger, will they make us sink to this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdepth of ignominy? The sword now shall be the arbiter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttill Allah passes His judgment between them and us.\" With\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese words they tore up the draft for the treaty which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad not yet been signed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the meantime Nuaim bin Masud, a member of the Ashja\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbranch of the Ghatafan tribe, became a Muslim and came\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the Holy Prophet and submitted: \"No one as yet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknows that I have embraced Islam: You can take from me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhatever service you please.\" The Holy Prophet replied:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Go and sow the seeds of discord among the enemy.\"' So,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst of all, Nuaim went to the Quraizah with whom he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton friendly terms, and said to them, \"The Quraish and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGhatafan can become wearied of the siege and go back, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey will lose nothing, but you have to live here with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims. Just consider what will be your position if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe matter turns that way. Therefore, I would advise you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot to join the enemy until the outsiders should send\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome of their prominent men as hostages to you.\" This had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe desired effect upon the Bani Quraizah and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecided to demand hostages from the united front of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribes. Then he went to the chiefs of the Quraish and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGhatafan and said to them, \"The Bani Quraizah seem to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslack and irresolute. May be they demand some men as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thostage from you, and then hand them over to Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be Allah's peace) to settle their affair with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim. Therefore, be very firm and cautious in your dealing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith them.\" This made the leaders of the united front\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuspicious of Bani Quraizah, and they sent them a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage, saying, \"We are tired of the long siege; let\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere be a decisive battle; let us, therefore, make a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeneral assault simultaneously from both the sides.\" The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBani Quraizah sent back the word, saying, \"We cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafford to join the war unless you hand over some of your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprominent men to us as hostages.\" The leaders of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunited front became convinced that what Nuaim had said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas true. They refused to send hostages. And the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraizah, on the other side, also felt that Nuaim had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven them the correct counsel. Thus, the strategy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworked: it divided the enemy against itself.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe siege was prolonged for more than 25 days. It was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twinter. The supply of food and water and forage was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecoming more and more scarce everyday and division in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe camp was also a great strain on the state of morale\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the besiegers. Then, suddenly one night a severe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twindstorm accompanied by thunder and lightning hit the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcamp. It added to the cold and darkness. The wind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toverthrew the tents and put the enemy in disarray. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould not stand this severe blow of nature. They left the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbattleground even during the night and returned to their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thomes. When the Muslims awoke in the morning, there was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot a single enemy soldier to be seen on the battlefield.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Holy Prophet, finding the battlefield completely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tempty, said: \"The Quraish will never be able to attack\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou after this: now you will take the offensive.\" This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas a correct assessment of the situation. Not only the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish but the united front of all the enemy tribes had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade their final assault against Islam and had failed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow they could no longer dare invade Madinah; now the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims were on the offensive.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Raid on Bani Quraizah</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the Holy Prophet returned from the Trench, Gabriel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame to him in the early afternoon with the Divine\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCommand the the Muslims should not lay aside the arms yet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut should deal with the Bani Quraizah as well. On\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceipt of this Command, the Holy Prophet announced:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Everyone who is steadfast in obedience should not offer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Asr Prayer till he reaches the locality of the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraizah.\" Immediately after this, he despatched Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAli with a contingent of soldiers as vanguard towards the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraizah. When they reached there, the Jews climbed on to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir roof tops and started hurling abuses on the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet and the Muslims, but their invectives could not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsave them from the consequences of their treachery. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad committed breach of the treaty right at the most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcritical moment of the war, joined hands with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvaders and endangered the entire population of Madinah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen they saw the contingent of Hadrat Ali, they thought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they had come only to overawe them.

They could not stand the severity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the siege for more than two or three weeks. At last,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey surrendered themselves to the Holy Prophet on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition that they would accept whatever decision Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSad bin Muadh, the chief of the Aus, would give. They had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccepted Hadrat Sad as their judge because in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpre-Islamic days the Aus and the Quraizah had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfederates and they hoped that in view of the past ties\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the would help them quit Madinah as had happened in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcase of the Bani Qainuqa and the Bani an-Nadir before.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe people of the Aus themselves wished that Hadrat Sad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreat their previous allies leniently. But Hadrat Sad had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjust experienced and seen how the two Jewish tribes who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad been allowed to leave Madinah previously had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstigated the other tribes living around Madinah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsummoned the united front of ten to twelve thousand men\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst the Muslims. He was also aware how treacherously\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis last Jewish tribe had behaved right on the occasion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen the city was under attack from outside and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthreatened the safety of the whole of its population.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, he decreed that all the male members of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraizah should be put to death, their women and children\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken prisoners, and their properties distributed among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims. The sentence was carried out duly. When the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims entered their strongholds they found that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreacherous people had collected 1,500 swords, 300 coats\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof mail, 2,000 spears and 1,500 shields in order to join\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe war. If Allah's succor had not reached the Muslims,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall this military equipment would have been used to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattack Madinah from the rear right at the time when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpolytheists were making preparations for a general\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassault on the Muslims after crossing the Trench. After\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis disclosure there remained no doubt that the decision\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Hadrat Sad concerning those people was absolutely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorrect.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Social Reforms</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThough the period of two years between the Battles of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUhud and the Trench was a period of disturbance and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tturmoil and the Holy Prophet and his Companions could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thardly relax in peace and security even for a day, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twork of reform as a whole and the reconstruction of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim society continued uninterrupted. This was the time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen the Islamic laws pertaining to marriage and divorce\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere complemented; the law of inheritance was introduced,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdrinking and gambling were prohibited, and the new laws\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand regulations concerning many other aspects of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teconomic and social life were enforced.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this connection, an important thing that needed to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treformed was the question of the adoption of a son.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhoever was adopted by the Arabs as a son was regarded as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone of their own offspring: he got share in inheritance;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the was treated like a real son and real brother by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadopted mother and the adopted sister; he could not marry\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe daughter of his adopted father and his widow after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this death. And the same was the case if the adopted son\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdied or divorced a wife. The adopted father regarded the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twoman as his real daughter-in-law. This custom clashed in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery detail with the laws of marriage and divorce and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinheritance enjoined by Allah in Surahs Al-Baqarah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn-Nisa. It made a person who could get no share in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinheritance entitled to it at the expense of those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere really entitled to it. It prohibited marriage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween the men and the women who could contract marriage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperfectly lawfully. And, above all, it helped spread the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timmoralities which the Islamic Law wanted to eradicate.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor a real mother and a real sister and a real daughter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot be like the adopted mother and the adopted sister\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the adopted daughter, however one may try to sanctify\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe adopted relations as a custom. When the artificial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelations endued with customary sanctity are allowed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmix freely like the real relations, it cannot but produce\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevil results. That is why the Islamic law of marriage and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivorce, the law of inheritance and the law of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprohibition of adultery required that the concept and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcustom of regarding the adopted son as the real son\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be eradicated completely.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis concept, however, could not be rooted out by merely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassing a legal order, saying, The adopted son is not the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treal son. The centuries old prejudices and superstitions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot be changed by mere word of mouth. Even if the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople had accepted the command that these relations were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot the real relations, they would still have looked upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarriage between the adopted mother and the adopted son,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe adopted brother and the sister, the adopted father\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the daughter, and the adopted father- in-law and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdaughter-in-law odious and detestable. Moreover, there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould still exist some freedom of mixing together freely.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, it was inevitable that the custom should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teradicated practically, and through the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself. For no Muslim could ever conceive that a thing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdone by the Holy Prophet himself, and done by him under\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's Command, could be detestable. Therefore, a little\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the Battle of the Trench, the Holy Prophet was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinspired by Allah that he should marry the divorced wife\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his adopted son, Zaid bin Harithah (may Allah be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpleased with him), and he acted on this Command during\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe siege of the Bani Quraizah. (The delay probably was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaused for the reason that the prescribed waiting period\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad not yet ended, and in the meantime the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad to become busy in the preparation for war).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Storm of Propaganda at the Marriage of Hadrat Zainab</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs soon as the marriage was contracted, there arose a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstorm of propaganda against the Holy Prophet. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpolytheists, the hypocrites and the Jews, all were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tburning with jealousy at his triumphs which followed one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the other. The way they had been humbled within two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyears after Uhud, in the Battle of the Trench, and in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffair of the Quraizah, had made them sore at heart. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad also lost hope that they could ever subdue him on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbattlefield. Therefore, they seized the question of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarriage as a godsend for themselves and thought they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould put an end to his moral superiority, which was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treal secret of his power and success. Therefore, stories\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere concocted that Muhammad, God forbid, had fallen in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlove with his daughter-in-law, and when the son had come\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto know of this, he divorced his wife, and the father\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarried his daughter-in-law. The propaganda, however, was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsurd on the face of it. Hadrat Zainab was the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's first cousin. He had known her from childhood\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto youth. So, there could be no question of his falling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin love with her at first sight. Then he himself had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarranged her marriage with Hadrat Zaid under his personal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinfluence, although her whole family had opposed it. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid not like that a daughter of the noble Quraish should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe given in marriage to a freed slave. Hadrat Zainab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\therself was not happy at this arrangement. But everyone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad to submit to the Holy Prophet's command. The marriage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas solemnized and a precedent was set in Arabia that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam had raised a freed slave to the status of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish nobility. If the Holy Prophet had in reality any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdesire for Hadrat Zainab, there was no need of marrying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther to Hadrat Zaid; he himself could have married her.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut in spite of all this, the shameless opponents\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvented stories of love, spread them with great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texaggeration and publicized them so vehemently that even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome Muslims also began to accept them as true.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Preliminary Commandments of Purdah</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe fact that the tales invented by the enemies also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecame topics of conversation among the Muslims was a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclear sign that the element of sensuality in society had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcrossed all limits. If this malady had not been there, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas not possible that minds would have paid any attention\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhatever to such absurd and disgusting stories about a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trighteous and pure person like the Holy Prophet. This was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprecisely the occasion when the reformative Commandments\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpertaining to the law of Hijab or Purdah were first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenforced in the Islamic society. These reforms were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintroduced in this Surah and complemented a year later in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah An-Nur, when a slander was made on the honor of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Aishah.(For further details, see Introduction to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah An-Nur).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Domestic Affairs of the Holy Prophet</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere were two other problems which needed attention at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat time. Though apparently they pertained to the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's domestic life, it was necessary to resolve them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the domestic and mental peace of the person who was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texerting every effort to promote the cause of Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tReligion and was day and night absorbed in this great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmission. Therefore, Allah took these two problems also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tofficially in His own hand.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe first problem was that economically the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat that time was in straitened circumstances. During the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst four years he had no source of income whatever. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t4 A.H. after the banishment of the Bani an-Nadir, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tportion of their evacuated lands was reserved for his use\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the Command of Allah, but it was not enough for his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfamily requirements. On the other hand, the duties of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffice of Prophethood were so onerous that they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsorbing all his energies of the mind and body and heart\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand every moment of his time, and he could not make any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teffort at all for earning his livelihood. In conditions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch as these when his wives happened to disturb his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmental peace because of economic hardships he would feel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoubly strained and taxed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe other problem was that before marrying Hadrat Zainab,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the had four wives already in the houses: Hadrat Saudah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Aishah, Hadrat Hafsah, and Hadrat Umm Salamah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Zainab was his fifth wife. At this the opponents\\n\\t\\t\\t\\traised the objection, and the Muslims also started\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentertaining doubts, that as for others it had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforbidden to keep more than four wives at a time, but how\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet himself had taken a fifth wife also.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Subject Matter and Topics</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese were the questions that were engaging the attention\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Holy Prophet and the Muslims at the time Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Ahzab was revealed, and replies to the same form the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubject matter of this Surah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA perusal of the theme and the background shows that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah is not a single discourse which was sent down in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone piece but it consists of several injunctions and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommandments and discourses, which were sent down, one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the other, in connection with the important events\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the time, and then were put together in one Surah.

The Holy Prophet was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfeeling the necessity that the concepts and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcustoms and superstitions of ignorance concerning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe adoption of the son should be eradicated, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\the was also feeling that the delicate and deep\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsentiments the people cherished about the adopted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trelations merely on emotional grounds would not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbe rooted out until he himself took the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinitiative to eradicate the custom practically.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBut at the same time he was hesitant and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconsidering seriously that if he married the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdivorced wife of Hadrat Zaid then, the hypocrites\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Jews and the mushriks who were already\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbent on mischief would get a fresh excuse to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tstart a propaganda campaign against Islam.

In this regard, reform was started\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the house of the Holy Prophet himself and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\this wives were commanded to avoid behaving and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconducting themselves in the ways of the pre\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic days of ignorance, to remain in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thouses with dignity, and to exercise great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcaution in their conversation with the other men.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis was the beginning of the Commandments of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPurdah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVerses 36-48 deal with the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmarriage with Hadrat Zainab.

Your anger, your tricks and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmachinations against it and your conspiracies and designs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto frustrate it are not directed against him but against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour own selves. If you do not listen to him, you will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tharming your own selves, not him. Just consider and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tponder over what he says: there is nothing wrong in it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe repudiates shirk. If you look around carefully, you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill yourself realize that there is no basis for shirk in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe world. He presents the doctrine of Tauhid. If you use\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour common sense, you will come to the conclusion that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is no being, beside Allah, Creator of the Universe,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich might possess divine attributes and powers and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority. He tells you that you have not been created to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe irresponsible in this world, but you have to render an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccount of your deeds before your God, and that there is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife after the life of this world when everyone will meet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe consequences of what he has done here. If you think a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlittle you will see that your doubts and your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tastonishment about it are absolutely baseless. Don't you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsee the phenomenon of the reproduction of creation day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand night. How can then your own recreation be impossible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor that God Who created you from an insignificant sperm\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdrop? Doesn't your own intellect testify that the good\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the evil cannot be alike? Then think and judge for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyourselves as to what is reasonable : should the good and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe evil meet with the same fate and end up in the dust,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor should the good be requited with good and the evil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith evil? Now, if you do not admit and acknowledge these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trational and reasonable things and do not abandon your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfalse gods, and wish to continue living only as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tirresponsible people in the world, the Prophet will not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlose anything. It is you yourselves only who will suffer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe consequences. The Prophet's only responsibility was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto make the truth plain to you, which he has done\".\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this connection, the Holy Prophet has been consoled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagain and again, as if to say: \"When you are doing full\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjustice to the preaching of your mission, you do not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincur any responsibility for those who persist in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\terror and do not accept and follow the right way\".\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFurthermore, he has also been consoled to the effect \"You\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould neither grieve on account of those who do not want\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto believe, nor consume yourself with the thought of how\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto bring them to the rights path.

The Surah Ya Sin has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen called the throbbing heart of the Quran because it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresents the message of the Quran in a most forceful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanner, which breaks the inertness and stirs the spirit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof man to action.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAgain Imam Ahmad, Aba Da'ud and Ibn Majah have related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the same Ma'qil bin Yasar that the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: \"Recite Surah Ya Sin to the dying ones among you.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe object is not only to revive and refresh the whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic creed in the mind of the dying person but also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbring before him, in particular, a complete picture of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hereafter so that he may know what stages he would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave to pass through after crossing the stage of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworldly life.

The style clearly indicates that antagonism is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\traging strong in the background and the Holy Prophet and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Companions are passing through very difficult and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscouraging circumstances.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Subject Matter and Theme</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe disbelievers of Makkah have been severely warned for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir attitude of mockery and derision with which they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere responding to the Holy Prophet's message of Tauhid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Hereafter and for their utter refusal to accept\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand acknowledge his claim to Prophethood. In the end,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey have been plainly warned that the Prophet whom they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare mocking and ridiculing will overwhelm them in spite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof their power and pelf and they will find the army of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah encamping in the very courtyards of their houses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(vv. 171-179. This notice was given at a time when there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappeared no chance whatever of the Holy Prophet's success\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand triumph. The Muslims (who have been called Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarmy in these verses) were being made the target of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsevere persecution. Three- fourths of their population\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad already emigrated and hardly 40 to 50 of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions were left with the Holy Prophet in Makkah who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere experiencing all sorts of the excesses with utter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelplessness. Under such circumstances, in view of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapparent conditions, no one could believe that the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet and the handful of his ill equipped Companions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould ultimately attain dominance. The people rather\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthought that the new movement would end and be buried in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe ravines of Makkah. But hardly 15 to 16 years had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassed when on the conquest of Makkah precisely the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthing happened of which the disbelievers had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforewarned. Along with administering warnings, Allah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah has done full justice also to the theme of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinducement and instruction in a balanced way. Brief but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timpressive arguments have been given about the validity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the doctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter. Criticism\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been made of the creed of the mushrikin to show the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsurdity of their beliefs; they have been informed of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe evil consequences of their deviations, which have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen contrasted with the splendid results of the faith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand righteous acts. Then, in continuation of the same,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPrecedents from past history have been cited to show how\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah had been treating His Prophets and their followers:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thow He has been favoring His faithful servants and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunishing their deniers and rejecters.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe most instructive of the historical narratives\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresented in this Surah is the important event of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpious life of the Prophet Abraham, who became ready to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrifice his only son as soon as he received an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinspiration from Allah. In this there was a lesson not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly for the disbelieving Quraish, who waxed proud of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir blood relationship with him, but also for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims who had believed in Allah and His Messenger. By\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnarrating this event they were told what is the essence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the real spirit of Islam, and how a true believer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be ready to sacrifice his all for the pleasure and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapproval of Allah after he has adopted it as his Faith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Creed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe last verses of the Surah were not only a warning for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe disbelievers but also a good news for the believers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho were passing through highly unfavorable and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscouraging conditions on account of their supporting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand following the Holy Prophet. In these verses they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven the good news that they should not be disheartened\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat the hardships and difficulties they had to encounter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the beginning, for in the end they alone would attain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdominance, and the standard bearers of falsehood, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappeared to be dominant at the time would be overwhelmed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand vanquished at their hands. A few years later the turn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe events took, proved that it was not an empty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsolation but an inevitable reality of which they had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen foretold in order to strengthen their hearts.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

For they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfeared that if Abu Talib died and then they subjected\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) to a harsh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreatment, after his death, the Arabs would taunt them,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying, \"They were afraid of the old chief as long as he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlived now that he is dead they have started maltreating\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this nephew.\" At least 25 of the Quraish chiefs including\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Jahl, Abu Sufyan, Umayyah bin Khalaf, As bin Wa'il,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAswad bin al-Muttalib, 'Uqbah bin Abi Mu'ait, Utbah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tShaibah went to Abu Talib.

Please tell him to make terms\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith us on this condition\". Abu Talib called the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet and said, \"Dear nephew, these people of your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribe have come to me with a request. They want you to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagree with them on a just matter so as to put an end to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour dispute with them.\" Then he told him about the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trequest of the chiefs of the Quraish. The Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied, \"Dear uncle: I shall request them to agree upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta thing which, if they accept, will enable them to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconquer the whole of Arabia and subject the non-Arab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld to their domination.\" Hearing this the people were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst confounded; they did not know how they should turn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown such a proposal.

In those days the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish chiefs had led several deputations to Abu Talib\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand had asked him to stop Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace and blessings) from preaching his message, and it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas with one of those deputations that this conversation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad taken place.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZamakhshari, Razi, Nisaburi and some other commentators\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay that this deputation went to Abu Talib at the time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen the chiefs of the Quraish had been upset at Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUmar's embracing Islam; but no reference to its basis is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tavailable in any book of the traditions, nor have these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentators cited the source of their this information.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, if it be true, it is understandable.

For them the concept of Tauhid and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter is not only an unacceptable creed but also a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcept which only deserves to be ridiculed and mocked.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, Allah, both in the initial part of the Surah and in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits last sentences, has precisely warned the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers, as if to say, \"The man whom you are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tridiculing today and whose guidance you reject will soon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toverpower you, and the time is not far when in this very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcity of Makkah, where you are persecuting him, he will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toverwhelm you completely.\" Then describing nine of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphets, one after the other, with greater details of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe story of the Prophets David and Solomon; Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temphasized the point that His Law of Justice is impartial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand objective, that only the right attitude of man is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacceptable to Him, that He calls to account and punishes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery wrongdoer, whoever he be, and that He likes only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose people who do not persist in wrongdoing but repent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas soon as they are warned of it, and pass their life in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe world keeping in mind their accountability in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, the final end that the obedient servants and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe disobedient people will meet in the Hereafter, has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen depicted, and two things have been especially\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timpressed on the disbelievers:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat the leaders and guides whom the ignorant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople are following blindly in the world, on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tway of deviation, will have reached Hell even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore their followers in the Hereafter, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo groups will be cursing each other there; \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat the disbelievers will be amazed to see that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is no trace whatever in Hell of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers whom they used to regard as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcontemptible in the world and will themselves be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinvolved in its torment.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, mention has been made of the story of Adam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Iblis (Satan), which is meant to tell the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelieving Quraish that the same arrogance and vanity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich was preventing them from bowing before Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be Allah's peace) had prevented Iblis also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom bowing before Adam. Iblis felt jealous of the high\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trank God had given to Adam and became accursed when he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisobeyed His Command. Likewise, \"You, O people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish, are feeling jealous of the high rank God has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbestowed on Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) and are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot prepared to obey him whom God has appointed His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessenger.

It is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsermon whose addressees mainly are the unbelieving\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish, although here and there the believers also have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen addressed.

Muhammad bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIshaq, the earliest biographer of the Holy Prophet, has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated on the authority of Muhammad bin Ka'b al-Qurzi,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe famous follower of the Companions, that one day some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Quraish chiefs were sitting in their assembly in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Masjid al-Haram, while in another corner of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMosque there was the Holy Prophet sitting by himself.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis was the time when Hadrat Hamzah had already embraced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam and the people of the Quraish were feeling upset at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe growing numbers of the Muslims. On this occasion,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUtbah bin Rabi'ah (the father-in-law of Abu Sufyan) said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Quraish chiefs: \"Gentlemen, if you like I would go\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand speak to Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessings) and put before him some proposals; maybe that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the accepts one of them, to which we may also agree, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso he stops opposing us.\" They all agreed to this, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUtbah went and sat by the Holy Prophet. When the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet turned to him, he said: \"Nephew, you know the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thigh status that you enjoy in the community by virtue of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour ancestry and family relations, but you have put your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople to great trouble: you have created divisions among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem and you consider them to be fools: you talk ill of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir religion and gods, and say things as though all our\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforefathers were pagans. Now listen to me and I shall\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake some suggestions. Consider them well: maybe that you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept one of them.\" The Holy Prophet said: \"Abul Walid,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay what you want to say and I shall listen to you.\" He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"Nephew, if by what you are doing, you want wealth,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twe will give you enough of it so that you will be the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trichest man among us; if you want to became an important\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman, we will make you our chief and will never decide a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter without you; if you want to be a king, we will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept you as our king; and if you are visited by a jinn,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom you cannot get rid of by your own power, we will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarrange the best physicians and have you treated at our\\n\\t\\t\\t\\town expense.\" 'Utbah went on speaking in this strain and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet went on listening to him quietly. Then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the said, \"Have you said, O Abul Walid, what you had to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay?\" He replied that he had. The Holy Prophet said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Well, now listen to me.\" Then pronouncing Bismillah ir\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRehman-ir-Rahim he began to recite this very Surah, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUtbah kept on listening to it, putting his hands behind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this back and leaning on them as he listened. Coming to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe verse of prostration (v. 38) the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprostrated himself; then raising his head, said, \"This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas my reply, O Abul Walid, now you may act as you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplease.\" Then Utbah arose and walked back towards the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchiefs, the people saw him from afar, and said: \"By God!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUtbah's face is changed. He does not look the same man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he was when he went from here.\" Then, when he came\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tback and sat down, the people asked, \"What have you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theard?\" He replied, \"By God! I have heard something the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike of which I had never heard before. By God, it's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneither poetry, nor sorcery, nor magic. O chiefs of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish, listen to what I say and leave this man to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself. I think what he recites is going to have its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teffect. If the other Arabs overcome him, you will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaved from raising your hand against your brother, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe others will deal with him. But if he overcame Arabia,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this sovereignty would be your sovereignty and his honor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour honor.\" Hearing this the chiefs spoke out: \"You too,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tO father of Walid, have been bewitched by his tongue.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUtbah replied, \"I have given you my opinion; now you may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tact as you please.\" (Ibn Hisham, vol. I, pp. 313-314).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis story has been narrated by several other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditionists also on the authority of Hadrat Jabir bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdullah in different ways, with a little variation in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twording. In some traditions it has also been related that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen during the recitation the Holy Prophet had come to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse 13, viz. \"If they turn away, say to them: I warn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou of a thunderbolt the like of which had visited the Ad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Thamud,\" Utbah had spontaneously placed his hand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the Holy Prophet's mouth, and said: \"For God's sake,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave mercy on your people.\" Afterwards he justified his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taction before the Quraish chiefs, saying: \"You know that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhatever Muhammad says is always fulfilled; therefore, I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfeared lest a torment should descend on us.\" (For\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetails, see Tafsir Ibn Kathir, vol. IV, pp. 90-91; Al\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBidayah wan-Nihayah, vol. III, p. 62).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the discourse that Allah sent down in response to what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUtbah said, no attention whatever was paid to the absurd\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproposals that he had made to the Holy Prophet. For what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the had said was, in fact, an attack on the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintention and his intellect. His assumption was that as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere was no possibility of his being a Prophet and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran being Allah's Revelation, inevitably the motive of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this invitation must either be the desire to obtain wealth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand political power, or, God forbid, he had lost his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason. In the first case, he wanted to make a bargain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the Holy Prophet; in the second, he was insulting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim when he said that the Quraish chiefs would have him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcured of his madness at their own expense. Obviously,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen the opponents come down to such absurd things, no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgentleman would like to answer them, but would ignore\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem and say what he himself had to say.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, ignoring what Utbah said, this Surah makes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tantagonism its subject of discussion, which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunbelieving Quraish were showing stubbornly and wickedly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin order to defeat the message of the Quran. They would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay to the Holy Prophet, \"You may try however hard you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttry: we would not listen to you. We have put coverings on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tour hearts and we have closed our ears. There is a wall\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween you and us, which would never let us meet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttogether.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey had given a clear notice to the Holy Prophet to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teffect: \"You may continue your mission of inviting the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople to yourself, but we would go on opposing you as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thard as we can to frustrate your mission.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor this object they had devised the following plan:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhenever the Holy Prophet or a follower of his would try\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto recite the Quran before the people, they would at once\\n\\t\\t\\t\\traise such a hue and cry that no one could hear anything.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey were desperately trying to misconstrue the verses of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran and spread every kind of misunderstanding among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people. They misconstrued everything and found fault\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven with the straightforward things. They would isolate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords and sentences from their right context, from here\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand there, and would add their own words in order to put\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnew meanings on them so as to mislead the people about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran and the Messenger who presented it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey would raise strange objections a specimen of which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been presented in this Surah. They said, \"If an Arab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresents a discourse in Arabic, what could be the miracle\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin it? Arabic is his mother tongue. Anyone could compose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything that he pleased in his mother tongue and then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake the claim that he had received it from God. It would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe a miracle if the person would suddenly arise and make\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan eloquent speech in a foreign tongue which he did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknow. Then only could one say that the discourse was not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his own composition but a revelation from God.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHere is a resume of what has been said in answer to this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeaf and blind opposition:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Quran is most certainly the Word of God,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhich He has sent down in Arabic.

It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tis surely Allah's mercy that He has sent down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Word for the guidance of man. If a person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tregarded it as an affliction, it would be his own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmisfortune.

Not to speak of preaching the message\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto others, the believers were even finding it difficult\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto follow the way of the Faith.

The solution he was given to this question was:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Although apparently the obstacles seem to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinsurmountable, the weapon of good morals and character\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcan smash and melt them away.

This will become clear to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery person who first studies Surah Ha-Mim As Sajdah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcarefully and then goes through this Surah. He will see\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat in that Surah the Quraish chiefs had been taken to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttack for their deaf and blind opposition so that anyone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Makkah and in its out-skirts, who had any sense of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmorality and nobility left in him, should know how\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunreasonably the chiefs of the people were opposing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace), and as against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem, how serious he was in everything he said, how\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trational was his standpoint and how noble his character\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand conduct. Immediately after that warning this Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas sent down, which did full justice to teaching and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstruction, and made the truth of the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage plain in such an impressive way that anyone who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad any element of the love of the truth in him and who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad not been blinded by the errors of ignorance, could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot help being influenced by it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe discourse begins in a way as if to say: \"Why are you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpressing surprise and amazement at what Our Prophet is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresenting before you? What he says is not new or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrange, nor anything novel, which might have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresented for the first time in history: that Revelation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould come down to a man from God and he should be given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstructions for the guidance of mankind. Allah has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsending similar Revelations with similar instructions to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe former Prophets before this. It is not surprising\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Owner of the Universe should be acknowledged as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDeity and Ruler, but what is strange is that one should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept another as divine and deity in spite of being His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubject and slave. You are being angry with him who is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresenting Tauhid before you, where as the shirk that you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare practicing with regard to the Master of the Universe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis such a grave crime as may cause the heavens to break\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasunder. The angels are amazed at this boldness of yours\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand fear that the wrath of Allah might descend on you any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmoment.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this the people have been told that a person's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing appointed to Prophethood and his presenting himself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas a Prophet does not mean that he has been made master\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the people's destinies and he has come to the world\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith that very claim. Allah has kept the destinies in His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\town hand. The Prophet has come only to arouse the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theedless and guide the strayed ones to the Right Path. To\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcall to account those who do not listen to him and to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunish or not to punish them is Allah's own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponsibility, and not part of the Prophet's work.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, they should take it out of their head that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet has come with a claim similar to those that are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade by their so called religious guides and saints to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe effect that he who would not listen to them, or would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehave insolently towards them, would be burnt to death:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this very connection, the people have also been told\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Prophet has not come to condemn them but he is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir well wisher; he is warning them that the way they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare following will only lead to their own destruction.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, an answer has been given to the question: Why\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdidn't Allah make all human beings righteous by birth,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand why did He allow the difference of viewpoint owing to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich the people start following each and every way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthought and action? The answer given is this: Owing to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis very fact has it become possible for man to attain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the special mercy of Allah, which is not meant for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother dumb creatures, but is only meant for those endowed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith power and authority, who should take Allah as Patron\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Guardian not instinctively but consciously by willing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchoice. Allah supports the man who adopts this way and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguides and helps him to do good and right and admits him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto His special mercy. On the contrary, the man who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmisuses his option and makes his patron those who are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot, in fact, the guardians, and cannot be, are deprived\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof divine mercy. In this connection, it has also been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade clear that only Allah is the Patron of man and of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall other creatures. Others are neither the patron nor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave the power to do full justice to patronage. Man's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuccess depends only on this that he should make no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmistake in choosing a patron for himself by the use of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this free choice, and should take only Him his Guide Who,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin reality, is the real Patron.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, it has been explained what the Din being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresented by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace) really is :\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIts primary basis that as Allah Almighty is the Creator,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMaster and real Patron of the Universe and Man, He alone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis Man's Ruler, He alone has the right to give Man Faith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Din) and Law (system of belief and practice) and judge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe disputes of man and tell what is Truth and what is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfalsehood. No other being has any right whatever to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman's lawgiver. In other words, like the natural\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsovereignty, the sovereignty with regard to lawmaking\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso is vested only in Allah. No man or creature, apart\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Allah, can be the bearer of this sovereignty. And if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta person does not recognize and accept this Divine rule\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah, it is merely futile for him to recognize the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnatural sovereignty of Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn this very basis has Allah ordained a Din (True\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tReligion) for Man from the very beginning. It was one and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same Religion that was vouchsafed in every age to all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophets. No Prophet ever founded any separate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligion of his own. The same one Religion has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoined by Allah for all Mankind since the beginning of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreation, and all the Prophets have been following it and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinviting others to follow it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Religion and Creed was not sent so that man may rest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontent only with believing in it, but it was sent with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe purpose and intention that it alone should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintroduced, established and enforced in the world, and no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman made religion be made to prevail in Allah's earth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapart from His Religion. The Prophets had not been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappointed only to preach this Religion but to establish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit particularly in the world.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis same was the original Religion of mankind, but after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe death of the Prophets, selfish people created new\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreeds by creating schisms for vested interests due to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tself-conceit, vanity and ostentation. All the different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligions and creeds found in the world today have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresulted from corruption of the original Divine Truth.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow, the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace,) has been sent so that he may present before the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople the same and original Religion in place of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvarious practices and artificial creeds and man made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligions, and may try to establish the same. On this, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstead of being grateful, you feel angry and come out to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfight him, it is your folly; the Prophet will not abandon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this mission only because of your foolishness. He has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoined to adhere to his faith at all costs and to carry\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout the mission to which he has been appointed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, the people should not cherish any false hope\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat in order to please them he would cater to the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhims and superstitions of ignorance which has corrupted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's Religion before.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYou do not understand how great an impudence it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst Allah to adopt a man made religion and law\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstead of the Religion and Law enjoined by Allah. You\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthink it is an ordinary thing and there is nothing wrong\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith it. But in the sight of Allah it is the worst kind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof shirk and a grave crime whose punishment will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timposed on all those who enforced their own religion on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's earth and those who adopted and followed their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligion.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThus, after presenting a clear and visible concept of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tReligion it is said: \"The best possible method that could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe employed for your instruction and for bringing you to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Right Path has already been employed. On the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thand, Allah has sent down His Book, which is teaching you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe truth in a most impressive way in your own language;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand on the other, the lives of the Holy Prophet Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be Allah's peace) and his Companions are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresent before you by which you can see for yourselves\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat kind of men are prepared by the guidance given in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Book. Even then if you do not accept this guidance,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnothing else in the world can bring you to the Right\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPath. The only alternative, therefore, is that you should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe allowed to persist in the same error in which you have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremained involved for centuries, and made to meet with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same doom which has been destined by Allah for such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrongdoers.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhile stating these truths, brief arguments have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven, here and there, for Tauhid and the Hereafter, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld worshipers have been warned of the evil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequences and their punishment in the life hereafter,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the disbelievers have been criticized for the moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tweaknesses, which were the real cause of their deviation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the truth. The Surah has been concluded with two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant themes.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst, that the Holy Prophet was wholly unaware of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcept of the \"Book\" or the True Faith during the first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforty years of his life and then his sudden appearance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the people with those two things, is a manifest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproof of his being a Prophet.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSecondly, his presenting his own teaching as the teaching\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof God does not mean that he claims to have spoken to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod, face to face, but God has conveyed to him this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGuidance, as in the case of all other Prophets, in three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tways: He speaks to His Prophets either through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRevelation, or from behind a veil, or He sends an angel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the message. This thing was clarified so that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topponents did not have an opportunity of accusing the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet of claiming to have spoken to God, face to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tface, and the lovers of the truth should know by what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmethods Allah gave instruction to the man whom He had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappointed to the mission of Prophethood.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

The same He will do again. A little further\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin vv. 41-43 and 79-80 the same thing has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treiterated. Though the people who were plotting against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this life are meant, the Holy Prophet has been addressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the effect: \"whether you remain alive or not, We will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcertainly punish the wicked,\" and the people themselves\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been plainly warned to the effect: \"If you have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecided to take an action against Our Prophet, We too\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill take a decisive action.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, it has been told what is the reality of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligion that the people are following so devotedly and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat are the arguments on whose strength they are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresisting Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBlessings).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey themselves admit that the Creator of the earth and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theavens and of themselves and their deities is only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah.

For under His Will not only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tidol worship but crimes like theft and adultery, robbery,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmurder, etc. also are being committed. Can this argument\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe used to justify as right and proper this commission of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery crime and evil in the world?\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen it is asked:Have you any other authority, apart from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis wrong argument, for the polytheism of yours? They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treply, \"The same has been the practice since the time of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tour forefathers.\" In other words, this in their opinion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis a strong enough argument for a creed's being right and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrue, whereas the Prophet Ibrahim, descent from whom is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe only basis of their pride and distinction, had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trejected the religion of his elders and left his home,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand he had discarded every such blind imitation of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforefathers, which did not have the support of any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trational argument. Then, if these people had to follow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir elders only, for this also they selected their most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tignorant elders and abandoned their most illustrious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telders like the Prophets Abraham and Ishmael (on whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen they are asked: \"Has ever a Prophet or a Book sent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown by God also given this teaching that others beside\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah too are worthy of worship? they present this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice of the Christians as an argument that they took\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJesus son of Mary as son of God and worshipped him;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhereas the question was not whether the community of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet had committed shirk or not, but whether a Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad himself taught shirk. Jesus son of Mary had never\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid that he was son of God and that the people should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworship him. His own was the same teaching which every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother Prophet had given: \"My Lord as well as your Lord is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah: so worship Him alone.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey were disinclined to believe in the Prophethood of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet because he was neither a rich man nor a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson of high worldly position and rank. They said \"Had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah willed to appoint a prophet among us, He would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappointed one of the great men of our two cities (Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Taif). On that very basis, Pharaoh also had looked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown upon the Prophet Moses and said: \"If Allah, the King\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the heavens, had to send a messenger to me, the king\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the earth, He would have sent him with bracelets of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgold and a company of angels in attendance. Wherefrom has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis mendicant appeared? I am superior to him, for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkingdom of Egypt belongs to me, and the canals of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRiver Nile are flowing under my control. What is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatus of this man as against me? He has neither wealth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnor authority.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThus, after criticizing each practice of ignorance of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers and rejecting it with rational arguments, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been pointed out: \"Neither has God any offspring, nor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare there separate gods of the earth and heavens, nor is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere any intercessor who may be able to protect from His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunishment those who adopt deviation knowingly. Allah is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfar above this that He should have children. He alone is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe God of the whole Universe: all others are His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tservants and not associates in His attributes and powers,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand only such men can intercede with Him, who are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves followers of the Truth and they also can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercede only for those who may have adopted obedience\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Truth in the world.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

However, this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah was sent down somewhat later. Its historical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbackground is this: When the disbelievers of Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecame more and more antagonistic in their attitude and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconduct, the Holy Prophet prayed: O God, help me with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfamine like the famine of Joseph. He thought that when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people would be afflicted with a calamity, they would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremember God, their hearts would soften and they would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept the admonition. Allah granted his prayer, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole land was overtaken by such a terrible famine that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people were sorely distressed. At last, some of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish chiefs among whom Hadrat Abdullah bin Masud has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticularly mentioned the name of Abu Sufyan came to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet and requested him to pray to Allah to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeliver his people from the calamity.

This Book by itself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbears the clear testimony that it is not the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcomposition of a man but of Allah, Lord of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tworlds.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"You are making a wrong estimate of the worth of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Book. You think it is a calamity that has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdescended on you, whereas the Hour when Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tout of sheer mercy, decided to send His Messenger\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand His Book to you was highly blessed.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"You are foolishly involved in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmisunderstanding that you will fight this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger and this Book and will win, whereas the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfact is that the Messenger has been raised and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Book sent down in that particular Hour when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah decides the destinies, and Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdecisions are not so weak that they may be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tchanged to a person's liking, nor are they based\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ton ignorance and folly that there may be the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlikelihood of a mistake or error or weakness in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthem. They are rather the firm and unalterable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdecisions of the Ruler of the Universe, Who is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAll Hearing, All Knowing and All Wise. Therefore,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthey cannot be treated lightly.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"You yourselves acknowledge that Allah alone is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Master and Lord of the earth and heavens and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof everything in the Universe and also admit that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlife and death are only in His power, yet you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinsist on making others your deities, for which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe only argument you offer is that that had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe practice since the time of your forefathers,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhereas if a person has the conviction that Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\talone is the Master, Sustainer and Giver of life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand death, he can never entertain the doubt that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthere can be other gods also beside Him, who can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbe worthy of worship. If your forefathers had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcommitted this folly, there is no reason why you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\talso should continue committing it blindly. As a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter of fact, their Lord too was only One God,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWho is your Lord, and they also should have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tworshipped only Him, Whom you should worship.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The only demand of Allah's Providence and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMercifulness is not this that He should feed you,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbut also this that He should arrange guidance for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tyou. For this very guidance He has sent His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger and His Book.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this introduction, the question of the famine that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas raging in Makkah has been discussed. As already\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned, this famine had occurred on the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayer, and he had prayed for it so that when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcalamity befell it would break the stubbornness of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers and then they would listen to the rebuke. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlooked as if this expectation was being fulfilled to some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textent, for some of the most stubborn enemies of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTruth, on account of the severity of the famine, had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcried out: \"O Lord, avert this torment from us and we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill believe.\" At this, on the one hand, the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been foretold: \"These people will not learn any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlesson from such calamities. When they have turned away\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the Messenger, whose life, character, works and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspeech clearly show that he is Allah's true Messenger,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thow will a mere famine help remove their disbelief?\" On\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe other, the unbelievers have been addressed, so as to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay : \"You lie when you say that you will believe as soon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas the torment is removed from you. We shall just remove\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit to see how sincere you are in your promise. There is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgraver disaster about to fall upon you. You need a much\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore crushing blow: minor misfortunes cannot set you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this very connection, a reference has been made a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlittle below to Pharaoh and his people, implying that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose people also had met with precisely the same trial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas the chiefs of the disbelieving Quraish are now\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafflicted. To them also a similar noble and honorable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger had come; they also had seen those express\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpointers and signs which clearly showed that he had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappointed by Allah; they also had gone on witnessing one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsign after the other but they did not give up their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstubbornness, till at last they made up their mind to put\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan end to the Messenger's life, and they met their doom,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich has since become an object lesson for the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor ever.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this the theme of the Hereafter has been taken up,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich the disbelievers of Makkah vehemently denied. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: \"We have never seen anyone rising back to life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter death. Raise our forefathers back to life if you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare true in your claim about the life hereafter.\" In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponse to this, two arguments for the Hereafter have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen presented briefly: \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat the denial of this creed has always proved\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdestructive for the morals\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat the universe is not a plaything of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthoughtless deity, but it is a wise system and no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twork of wisdom is ever vain or useless. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen the disbelievers' demand to bring their forefathers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tback to life has been answered, thus: \"This cannot be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdone every day to meet the demand of the individuals, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah has appointed a time when He will resurrect all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmankind simultaneously and will subject them to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccountability in His Court. If one has to protect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toneself there, one should think about it here. For no one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill be able to save himself there by his own power, nor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the power of any one else.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn connection with this Court of Allah, mention has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade of the fate of those who will be declared as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tculprits and of the rewards of those who will be declared\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas successful. The discourse has been concluded with this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twarning: \"This Quran has been revealed in simple language\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin your own tongue so that you may understand it; yet if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou do not understand it and insist on seeing your evil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tend, you may wait; Our Prophet too is waiting. Whatever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis to happen, will happen at its own appointed time.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis connection, reference has been made to the countless\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSigns that are found in the world, from man's own body to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe earth and heavens, and it is pointed out that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teverywhere around him man finds things which testify to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttauhid which he refuses to acknowledge. If man sees\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcarefully the variety of animals, the day and night, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trainfall and the vegetation thereby, the winds and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\town creation, and ponders over them intelligently,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout prejudice, he will find these Signs sufficiently\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconvincing of the truth that this universe is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGodless, nor under the control of many gods, but it has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen created by One God, and He alone is its Controller\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Ruler. However, the case of the person who is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetermined not to acknowledge and wants to remain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvolved in doubts and suspicions is different. He cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe blessed with the faith and conviction from anywhere in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe world.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA little below, in the beginning of the second section,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit has been reiterated that the things man is exploiting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the world, and the countless forces and agencies that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare serving his interests in the universe, did not come\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto being just accidentally, nor have they been provided\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the gods and goddesses, but it is One God alone, Who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas supplied and subjected these to him from Himself. If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly a person uses his mind properly and rightly, his own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintellect will proclaim that God alone is man's real\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBenefactor and He alone deserves that man should pay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobeisance to Him.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, the disbelievers of Makkah have been taken to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttask and reproved for their stubbornness, arrogance,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmockery and insistence on disbelief with which they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresisting the invitation of the Quran; they have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twarned that this Quran has brought the same blessing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich had been granted to the children of Israel before,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby virtue of which they became distinguished above all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people of the world. Then, when they failed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecognize the true worth of this blessing and disputed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir religion and lost it, this blessing now has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsent to them. This is such a code of guidance which shows\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe clear highway of Religion to man. The people who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould turn it down by their own folly, would only prepare\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor their own doom, and only such people would become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworthy of God's succor and mercy who would adopt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobedience to it and lead a life of piety and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trighteousness.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this connection, the followers of the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been instructed that they should forbear and pardon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe absurd and foolish behavior towards them of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople fearless of God, for if they showed patience God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHimself would deal with their opponents and would reward\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem for their fortitude.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, there is a criticism of the erroneous ideas that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe disbelievers hold about the Hereafter. They said that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife was only this worldly life there was no life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thereafter. Man dies in the course of time just as a watch\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstops functioning suddenly. The body is not survived by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany soul, which might be seized and then breathed again\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto the human body some time in the future. In this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregard, they challenged the Holy Prophet, saying: \"If you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlay a claim to this, then raise our dead forefathers back\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto life.\" In answer to this, Allah has given the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowing arguments\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"You do not say this on the basis of any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tknowledge but are uttering this grave thing on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe basis of conjecture. Do you really have the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tknowledge that there is no other life after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath, and the souls are not seized but are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tannihilated?\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Your claim rests mainly on this: that you have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnot seen any dead person rising back to life and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treturning to the world. Is this basis strong\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tenough for a person to make a claim that the dead\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople will never rise to life?When you do not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\texperience and observe a thing, does it mean that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tyou have the knowledge that it does not exist at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tall?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is utterly against reason and justice that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgood and the bad, the obedient and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdisobedient, the oppressor and the oppressed,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be made equal ultimately. Neither a good\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tact should bear a good result nor an evil act an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tevil result; neither the grievances of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\toppressed be redressed nor the oppressor be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpunished, but everyone should meet with the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfate ultimately. Whoever has formed this view\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tabout the universe of God, has formed a patently\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twrong view. The unjust and wicked people adopt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthis view because they do not want to face the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tevil results of their deeds, but this world of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGod is not a lawless kingdom; it is rather a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsystem based on the Truth, in which there can be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tno question of the injustice of regarding the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgood and the bad as equal.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat the creed of the denial of the Hereafter is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thighly destructive of morals.

This incident of the visit of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjinn and their going back after listening to the Quran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad occurred, according to agreed traditions of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadith and biographical literature, at the time when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet had halted at Makkah during his return\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjourney from Ta'if to Makkah.

The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish and the other tribes had continued their boycott\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Bani Hashim and the Muslims for three years and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet and the people of his family and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions lay besieged in Shi'b Abi Talib. The Quraish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad blocked up this locality from every side so that no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupplies of any kind could reach the besieged people.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOnly during the Hajj season they were allowed to come out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand buy some articles of necessity. But even at that time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhenever Abu Lahab noticed any of them approaching the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarket place or a trading caravan he would call out to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe merchants exhorting them to announce forbidding rates\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof their articles for them, and would pledge that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself would buy those articles so that they did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuffer any loss. This boycott which continued\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuninterrupted for three years had broken the back of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims and the Bani Hashim; so much so that at times\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were even forced to eat grass and the leaves of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrees.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt last, when the siege was lifted this year, Abu Talib,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet's uncle, who had been shielding him for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tten long years, died, and hardly a month later his wife,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Khadijah, who had been a source of peace and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsolation for him ever since the beginning of the call,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso passed away. Because of these tragic incidents,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich closely followed each other, the Holy Prophet used\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto refer to this year as the year of sorrow and grief.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter the death of Hadrat Khadijah and Abu Talib the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers of Makkah became even bolder against the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet. They started treating him even more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tharshly. So much so that it became difficult for him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstep out of his house. Of these days Ibn Hisham has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated the incident that a Quraish scoundrel one day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrew dust at him openly in the street.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt last, the Holy Prophet left for Ta'if with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintention that he should invite the Bani Thaqif to Islam,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor even if they did not accept Islam, they might at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleast be persuaded to allow him to work for his mission\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeacefully. He did not have the facility of any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconveyance at that time, and traveled all the way to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTa'if on foot. According to some traditions, he had gone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere alone, but according to others, he was accompanied\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Zaid bin Harithah. He stayed at Ta'if for a few days,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand approached each of the chiefs and nobles of the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThaqif and talked to him about his mission. But not only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey refused to listen to him, but plainly gave him the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnotice that he should leave their city, for they feared\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat his preaching might \"spoil\" their younger\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeneration. Thus, he was compelled to leave Ta'if. When\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the was leaving the city, the chiefs of Thaqif set their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslaves and scoundrels behind him, who went on crying at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, abusing him and petting him with stones for a long\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tway from either side of the road till he became broken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown with wounds and his shoes were filled with blood.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWearied and exhausted he took shelter in the shade of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twall of a garden outside Ta'if, and prayed:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"O God, to Thee I complain of my weakness, little\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresource, and lowliness before men.

He looked up and saw Gabriel in front of him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho called out: \"Allah has heard the way your people have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponded. He has, therefore, sent this angel in charge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the mountains. You may command him as you please.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen the angel of the mountains greeted him and submitted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t: \"If you like I would overturn the mountains from either\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tside upon these people.\" The Holy Prophet replied : \"No,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut I expect that Allah will create from their seed those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho will worship none but Allah, the One.\" (Bukhari,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDhikr al Mala'ikah; Muslim: Kitab al-Maghazi; Nasa'i\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t:Al-Bauth).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this he went to stay for a few days at Makkah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperplexed as to how he would face the people of Makkah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho, he thought, would be still further emboldened\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst him after hearing what had happened at Ta'if. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas here that one night when he was reciting the Quran in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prayer, a group of the jinn happened to pass by and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlistened to the Quran, believed in it, and returned to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir people to preach Islam. Thus, Allah gave His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet the good news that if the men were running away\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom his invitation, there were many of the jinn, who had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome its believers, and they were spreading his message\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong their own kind.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Subject Matter and Topics</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSuch were the conditions when this Surah was sent down.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnyone who keeps this background in view, on the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thand, and studies this Surah, on the other, will have no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoubt left in his mind that this is not at all the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomposition of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace), but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"a Revelation from the All Mighty, All Wise Allah.\" For\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnowhere in this Surah, from the beginning to the end,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes one find even a tinge of the human feelings and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treactions, which are naturally produced in a man who is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassing through such hard conditions. Had it been the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tword of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) whom the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurrence of personal griefs one after the other and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountless and the recent bitter experience at Ta'if had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaused extreme anguish and distress, it would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treflected in some degree the state of the mind of the man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho was the subject of these afflictions and griefs.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConsider the prayer that we have cited above: it contains\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this own language, its every word is saturated with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfeelings that he had at the time. But this Surah which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas sent down precisely in the same period and was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited even by him under the same conditions, is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsolutely free from every sign or trace of the time.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe subject matter of the Surah is to warn the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers of the errors in which they were involved,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand also persisted arrogantly, and were condemning the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman who was trying to redeem them. They regarded the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld as a useless and purposeless place where they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot answerable to anyone. They thought that invitation to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTauhid was false and stuck to the belief that their own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeities were actually the associates of Allah. They were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot inclined to believe that the Quran was the Word of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Lord of the worlds. They had a strange erroneous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcept of apostleship on the basis of which they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproposing strange criteria of judging the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclaim to it. In their estimation one great proof of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam's not being based on the truth was that their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telders and important chiefs of the tribes and so called\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleaders of their nation were not accepting it and only a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfew young men, and some poor folks and some slaves had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffirmed faith in it. They thought that Resurrection and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife after death and the rewards and punishments of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter were fabrications whose occurrence was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsolutely out of the question.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this Surah each of these misconceptions has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefuted in a brief but rational way, and the disbelievers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been warned that if they would reject the invitation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Quran and the Prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be Allah's peace) by prejudice and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstubbornness instead of trying to understand its truth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trationally, they would only be preparing for their own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoom.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Although the Muslims had emigrated to the haven of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah from every side, the disbelieving Quraish were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot prepared to leave them alone and let them live in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace even there. Thus, the small settlement of Madinah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas hemmed in by the enemy, who was bent upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texterminating it completely. The only alternative left\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the Muslims were that either they should surrender\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the forces of ignorance, giving up their mission of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreaching the true Faith, or even following it in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprivate lives, or should rise to wage a war at the cost\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof their lives to settle finally and for ever whether\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam would stay in Arabia or the creed of ignorance. On\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis occasion Allah showed the Muslims the same way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treso1ution and will, which is the only way for the true\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers. He first permitted them to fight in Surah Al\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj 39 and then enjoined fighting in Al Baqarah 190. But\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat that time everyone knew fully well what it meant to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twage a war in those conditions. There were only a handful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Muslims in Madinah, who could not muster even a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthousand soldiers; yet they were being urged to take up\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sword and clash against the pagan forces of the whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Arabia. Then the kind of the weapons needed to equip\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits soldiers for war could hardly be afforded by the town\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin which hundreds of emigrants were still homeless and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunsettled even by resort to starving its members at a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime when it had been boycotted economically by the Arabs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton all sides.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSuch were the conditions when this Surah was revealed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIts theme is to prepare the believers for war and to give\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem preliminary instructions in this regard. That is why\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit has also been entitled al-Qital. It deals with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowing topics:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt the outset it is said that of the two groups\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfronting each other at this time, one has refused to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept the Truth and has become an obstruction for others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the way of Allah, while the other group has accepted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Truth which had been sent down by Allah to His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tservant, Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessings). Now, Allah's final decision is that He has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trendered fruitless and vain all the works of the former\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgroup and set right the condition and affairs of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlatter group.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, the Muslims have been given the initial war\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstructions they have been reassured of Allah's help and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguidance: they have been given hope for the best rewards\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton offering sacrifices in the cause of Allah and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been assured that their struggle in the cause of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTruth will not go to waste, but they will be abundantly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trewarded both in this world and in the Hereafter.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFurthermore, about the disbelievers it has been said that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey are deprived of Allah's support and guidance: none\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof their designs will succeed in their conflict with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers, and they will meet a most evil fate both in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis world and in the Hereafter. They thought they had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tachieved a great success by driving the Prophet of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout of Makkah, but in fact by this they had hastened\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir own doom.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, the discourse turns to the hypocrites, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere posing to be sincere Muslims before the command to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfight was sent down, but were confounded when this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommand actually came down, and began to conspire with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe disbelievers in order to save themselves from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thazards of war. They have been plainly warned to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teffect that no act and deed is acceptable to Allah of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who adopt hypocrisy with regard to Him and His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet. There, the basic issue against which all those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho profess the Faith are being tried is whether one is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the side of the Truth or Falsehood, whether one's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsympathies are with Islam and the Muslims or with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelief and the disbelievers, whether one keeps one's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\town self and interests dearer or the Truth which one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprofesses to believe in and follow. One who fails in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttest is not at all a believer; his Prayer and his Fasting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand his discharging of the zakat deserve no reward from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen the Muslims have been exhorted not to lose heart for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing small in numbers and ill equipped as against the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreat strength of the disbelievers: they should not show\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tweakness by offering peace to them, which might still\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfurther embolden them against Islam and the Muslims, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey should come out with trust in Allah and clash with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mighty forces of disbelief. Allah is with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims: they alone shall triumph; and the might of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelief will be humbled and vanquished.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, the Muslims have been invited to spend\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir wealth in the cause of Allah. Although at that time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were economically very weak, the problem that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfronted was the very survival of Islam and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims. The importance and delicacy of the problem\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemanded that the Muslims should not only risk their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlives for safeguarding themselves and their Faith from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe dominance of disbelief and for exalting Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tReligion but should also expend their economic resources\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas far as possible in the preparations for war.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, they were clearly warned to the effect: Anyone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho adopted a niggardly attitude at the time, would not,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin fact, harm Allah at all, but would result in his own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestruction, for Allah does not stand in need of help\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom men. If one group of men shirked offering sacrifices\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the cause of His Religion, Allah would remove it and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbring another group in its place.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Obviously, the Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdream could not be a mere dream and fiction for it is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkind of Divine inspiration as Allah Himself has confirmed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin verse 27 below and said that He Himself had shown that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdream to His Messenger. Therefore, it was not merely a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdream but a Divine inspiration which the Holy Prophet had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto obey and follow.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tApparently, there was no possible way of acting on this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinspiration. The disbelieving Quraish had debarred the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims from proceeding to the Ka'bah for the past six\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyears and no Muslim had been allowed during that period\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto approach the Kaabah for the purpose of performing hajj\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand umrah. Therefore, it could not be expected that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould allow the Holy Prophet to enter Makkah along with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparty of his Companions. If they had proceeded to Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the pilgrim garments with the intention of performing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tumrah, along with their arms, this would have provoked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe enemy to war, and if they had proceeded unarmed, this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould have meant endangering his own as well as his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions' lives. Under conditions such as these nobody\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould see and suggest how the Divine inspiration could be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacted upon.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut the Prophet's position was different. It demanded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he should carry out whatever Command his Lord gave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfearlessly and without any apprehension and doubt.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, the Holy Prophet informed his Companions of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this dream and began to make preparations for the journey.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmong the tribes living in the suburbs also he had the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpublic announcement made that he was proceeding for umrah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the people could join him. Those who could only see\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe apparent conditions thought that he and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions were going into the very jaws of death none of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem therefore was inclined to accompany him in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpedition. But those who had true faith in Allah and His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger were least bothered about the consequences. For\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem this information was enough that it was a Divine\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinspiration and Allah's Prophet had made up his mind to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcarry it into effect. After this nothing could hinder\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem from accompanying the Messenger of Allah. Thus,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t1,400 of the Companions became ready to follow him on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis highly dangerous journey.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis blessed caravan set off from Madinah in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeginning of Dhil Qa'dah, A.H. 6. At Dhul Hulaifah they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentered the pilgrims robe with the intention of umrah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttook 70 camels with collars round their necks indicating\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they were sacrificial animals; kept only a sword\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teach in sheaths, which the pilgrims to the Kaabah were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallowed to carry according to the recognized custom of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia, but no other weapon. Thus, the caravan set out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the Ka'bah, the House of Allah, at Makkah, chanting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe prescribed slogan of Labbaik, Allahuma labbaik.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe nature of the relations between Makkah and Madinah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose days was known too well to every Arab. Just the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevious year, in Shawwal A.H. 5, the Quraish mustering\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe united strength of the Arab tribes had invaded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah and the well known Battle of the Trench had taken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplace. Therefore, when the Holy Prophet along with such a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlarge caravan set off for the home of his blood-thirsty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenemy, the whole of Arabia looked up with amazement, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people also noticed that the caravan was not going\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the intention to fight but was proceeding to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse of Allah in a forbidden month in the pilgrims garb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcarrying sacrificial animals and was absolutely unarmed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Quraish were confounded at this bold step taken by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet. Dhil-Qa'dah was one of those forbidden\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmonths which had been held as sacred for pilgrimage in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia for centuries. Nobody had a right to interfere\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith a caravan which might be coming for hajj or umrah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe pilgrims garb in this month; so much so that even an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenemy tribe could not hinder it from passing through its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterritory according to the recognized law of the land.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Quraish therefore were caught in a dilemma, for if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey attacked this caravan from Madinah and stopped it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom entering Makkah, this would arouse a clamor of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprotest in the whole country, and all the Arab tribes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould have the misgiving that the Quraish had monopolized\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Ka'bah as exclusively their own, and every tribe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be involved in the mistrust that now it depended on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe will of the Quraish to allow or not to allow anyone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto perform hajj or umrah in the future and that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould stop any tribe with which they were angry from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvisiting the Ka'bah just as they had stopped the Madinese\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpilgrims. This they thought would be a grave mistake,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich would cause the entire Arabia to revolt against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem. But, on the other hand, if they allowed Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) and his large\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaravan to enter their city safely, they would lose their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timage of power in Arabia and the people would say that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were afraid of Muhammad. At last, after a great deal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof confusion, perplexity and hesitation they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tovercome by their false sense of honor and for the sake\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof their prestige they took the decision that they would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat no cost allow the caravan to enter the city of Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Holy Prophet had despatched a man of the Bani Ka'b as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta secret agent so that he may keep him fully informed of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe intentions and movements of the Quraish. When the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet reached Usfan, he brought the news that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish had reached Dhi Tuwa with full preparations and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey had sent Khalid bin Walid with two hundred cavalry\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen in advance towards Kura'al-Ghamim to intercept him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Quraish wanted somehow to provoke the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions into fighting so that they may tell the Arabs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat those people had actually come to fight and had put\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the pilgrims garments for umrah only to deceive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tImmediately on receipt of this information the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet changed his route and following a very rugged,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trocky track reached Hudaibiyah, which was situated right\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the boundary of the sacred Makkan territory. Here, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas visited by Budail bin Warqa the chief of the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhuza'ah, along with some men of his tribe. They asked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat he had come for. The Holy Prophet replied that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand his Companions bad come only for pilgrimage to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse of Allah and for going round it in worship and not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor war. The men of Khuza'ah went and told this to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish chiefs and counseled them not to interfere with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe pilgrims. But the Quraish were obstinate. They sent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHulays bin Alqamah, the chief of the Ahabish, to the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet to persuade him to go back. Their object was that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) would not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlisten to Hulays, he would come back disappointed and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen the entire power of the Ahabish would be on their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tside. But when Hulays went and saw that the whole caravan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad put on the pilgrims garments, had brought sacrificial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcamels with festive collars round their necks, and had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcome for doing reverence to the House of Allah and not to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfight, he returned to Makkah without having any dialogue\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the Holy Prophet and told the Quraish chiefs plainly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat those people had no other object but to pay a visit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Ka'bah; if they debarred them from it, the Ahabish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould not join them in that, because they had not become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir allies to support them even if they violated the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacred customs and traditions.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen the Quraish sent Urwah bin Mas'ud Thaqafi; he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlengthy negotiations with the Holy Prophet in an effort\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto persuade him to give up his intention to enter Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut the Holy Prophet gave him also the same reply that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad given to the chief of the Khuza'ah, that they had not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcome to fight but to do honor to the House of Allah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcarry out a religious duty. Urwah went back and said to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quraish: \"I have been to the courts of the Caesar and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhosroes, and the Negus also, but by God, never have I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseen any people so devoted to a king as are the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessings) to him. If Muhammad makes his ablutions they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould not let the water thereof fall on the ground but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould rub it on their bodies and clothes. Now you may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecide as to what you should do.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the meantime when the messages were coming and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnegotiations were going on, the Quraish tried again and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagain to quietly launch sudden attacks on the Muslim camp\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin order to provoke the Companions and somehow incite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem to war, but every time they did so the Companions'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforbearance and patience and the Holy Prophet's wisdom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand sagacity frustrated their designs. On one occasion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforty or fifty of their men came at night and attacked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslim camp with stones and arrows. The Companions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarrested all of them and took them before the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, but he let them go. On another occasion 80 men\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame from the direction of Tan'im right at the time of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Fajr Prayer and made a sudden attack. They were also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaught, but the Holy Prophet forgave them, too. Thus, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish went on meeting failure after failure in every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone of their designs.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt last, the Holy Prophet sent Hadrat Uthman (may Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe pleased with him) as his own messenger to Makkah with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe message that they had not come to fight but only for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpilgrimage and had brought their sacrificial camels\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talong, and they would go back after performing the rite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof pilgrimage and offering the sacrifice. But the Quraish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid not agree and withheld Hadrat Uthman in the city. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe meantime a rumor spread that Hadrat Uthman had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkilled; and when he did not return in time the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttook the rumor to be true. Now they could show no more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforbearance. Entry into Makkah was different for there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas no intention to use force. But when the ambassador\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas put to death, the Muslims had no alternative but to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprepare for war. Therefore, the Holy Prophet summoned all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Companions together and took a solemn pledge from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem that they would fight to death. In view of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcritical occasion it was not an ordinary undertaking. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims numbered only 1400 and had come without any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tweapons, were encamping at the boundary of Makkah, 250\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmiles away from their own city, and the enemy could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattack them in full strength, and could surround them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith its allies from the adjoining tribes as well. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspite of this, none from the caravan except one man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfailed to give his pledge to fight to death, and there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould be no greater proof of their dedication and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsincerity than that in the cause of Allah. This pledge is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell known in the history of Islam as the pledge of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRidwan.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater it was known that the news about Hadrat Uthman was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfalse. Not only did he return but under Suhail bin 'Amr\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the Quraish also arrived a deputation to negotiate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace with the Holy Prophet. Now, the Quraish no more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinsisted that they would disallow the Holy Prophet and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Companions to enter Makkah. However, in order to save\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir face they only insisted that he went back that year\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut could come the following year to perform the umrah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter lengthy negotiations peace was concluded on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowing terms:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWar would remain suspended for ten years, and no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tparty would indulge in any hostility, open or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsecret, against the other.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIf any one during that period from among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish went over to Muhammad, without his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tguardian's permission, he would return him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthem, but if a Companion of Muhammad came oven to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quraish, they would not return him to him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEvery Arab tribe would have the option to join\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\teither side as its ally and enter the treaty.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad and his men would go back that year and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcould come the following year for umrah and stay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin Makkah for three days, provided that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbrought only one sheathed sword each, and no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tother weapon of war. In those three days the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkans would vacate the city for them (so that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthere was no chance of a clash), but they would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnot be allowed to take along any Makkan on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treturn. When the conditions of the treaty were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing settled, the whole of the Muslim army was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfeeling greatly upset. No one understood the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\texpedience because of which the Holy Prophet was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccepting the conditions. No one was farsighted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tenough to foresee the great benefit that was to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tresult from this treaty. The disbelieving Quraish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlooked at it as their victory, and the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twere upset as to why they should be humiliated to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccepting those mean conditions. Even a statesman\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof the caliber of Hadrat Umar says that he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnever given way to doubt since the time he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tembraced Islam but on this occasion he also could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnot avoid it. Impatient he went to Hadrat Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBakr and said \"Is he (the Holy Prophet) not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's Messenger, and are we not Muslims, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tare they not polytheists? Then, why should we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tagree to what is humiliating to our Faith?\" He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treplied \"O Umar, he is surely Allah's Messenger,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Allah will never make him the loser.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tUnsatisfied he went to the Holy Prophet himself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand put the same questions to him, and he also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgave him the same replies as Hadrat Abu Bakr had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven. Afterwards Hadrat Umar continued to offer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tvoluntary prayers and give aims so that Allah may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpardon his insolence that he had shown towards\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet on that occasion.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTwo things in the treaty were highly disturbing for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims first, the second condition, about which they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid that it was an expressly unfair condition, for if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey had to return a fugitive from Makkah, why should not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quraish return a fugitive from Madinah? To this the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet replied: \"What use would be he to us, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfled from us to them? May Allah keep him away from us!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd if we return the one who flees to us from them, Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill create some other way out for him.\" The other thing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat was rankling in their minds was the fourth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition. The Muslims thought that agreeing to it meant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they were going back unsuccessful and this was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thumiliating. Furthermore, the question that was causing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem feel upset was that they had accepted the condition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof going back without performing the pilgrimage to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKa'bah, whereas the Holy Prophet had seen in the vision\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they were performing tawaf at Makkah. To this the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet replied that in his vision the year had not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen specified. According to the treaty conditions,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore, they would perform the tawaf the following\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyear if it pleased Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRight at the time when the document was being written,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSuhail bin 'Amr's own son, Abu Jandal, who had become a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim and been imprisoned by the pagans of Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomehow escaped to the Holy Prophet's camp. He had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfetters on his feet and signs of violence on his body. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timplored the Holy Prophet that he help secure his release\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom imprisonment. The scene only increased the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions' dejection, and they were moved beyond\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontrol. But Suhail bin 'Amr said the conditions of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagreement had been concluded between them although the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twriting was not yet complete; therefore, the boy should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe returned to them. The Holy Prophet admitted his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\targument and Abu Jandal was returned to his oppressors.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the document was finished, the Holy Prophet spoke to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Companions and told them to slaughter their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrificial animals at that very place, shave their heads\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand put off the pilgrim garments, but no one moved from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this place. The Holy Prophet repeated the order thrice but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Companions were so overcome by depression and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdejection that they did not comply. During his entire\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod of apostleship on no occasion had it ever happened\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he should command his Companions to do a thing and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey should not hasten to comply with it. This caused him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta great shock, and he repaired to his tent and expressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this grief before his wife, Hadrat Umm Salamah. She said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"You may quietly go and slaughter your own camel and call\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe barber and have your head shaved. After that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople would automatically do what you did and would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstand that whatever decision had been taken would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot be changed.\" Precisely the same thing happened. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople slaughtered their animals, shaved their heads or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcut their hair short and put off the pilgrim garb, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir hearts were still afflicted with grief.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater, when this caravan was returning to Madinah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfeeling depressed and dejected at the truce of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHudaibiyab, this Surah came down at Dajnan (or according\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto some others, at Kura' al-Ghamim), which told the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims that the treaty that they were regarding as their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefeat, was indeed a great victory. After it had come\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown, the Holy Prophet summoned the Muslims together and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: \"Today such a thing has been sent down to me, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis more valuable to me than the world and what it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontains.\" Then be recited this Surah, especially to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Umar, for he was the one who was feeling most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdejected.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAlthough the believers were satisfied when they heard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Divine Revelation, not much longer afterwards the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadvantages of this treaty began to appear one after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother until every one became fully convinced that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace treaty indeed was a great victory:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn it for the first time the existence of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic State in Arabia was duly recognized.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBefore this in the eyes of the Arabs the position\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace) and his Companions was no more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthan of mere rebels against the Quraish and other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArab tribes, and they regarded them as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\toutlaws. Now the Quraish themselves by concluding\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthis agreement with the Holy Prophet recognized\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\this sovereignty over the territories of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic State and opened the way for the Arab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttribes to enter treaties of alliance with either\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof the political powers they liked.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBy admitting the right of pilgrimage to the House\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah for the Muslims, the Quraish also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tadmitted that Islam was not an anti-religious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcreed, as they had so far been thinking, but it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twas one of the admitted religions of Arabia, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlike the other Arabs, its followers also had the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tright to perform the rites of hajj and umrah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis diminished the hatred in the Arabs hearts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat had been caused by the propaganda made by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quraish against Islam.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe signing of a no-war pact for ten years\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprovided full peace to the Muslims, and spreading\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto every nook and corner of Arabia they preached\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam with such spirit and speed that within two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tyears after Hudaibiyah the number of the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twho embraced Islam far exceeded those who bad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tembraced it during the past 19 years or so. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twas all due to this treaty that two years later\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhen in consequence of the Quraish's violating\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe treaty the Holy Prophet invaded Makkah, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twas accompanied by an army 10,000 strong, whereas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ton the occasion of Hudaibiyah only 1,400 men had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tjoined him in the march.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter the suspension of hostilities by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish the Holy Prophet had the opportunity to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\testablish and strengthen Islamic rule in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tterritories under him and to turn the Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsociety into a full fledged civilization and way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof life by the enforcement of Islamic law. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tis that great blessing about which Allah says in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tverse 3 of Surah Al-Ma'idah: \"Today I have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tperfected your Religion for you and completed My\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tblessing on you and approved Islam as the Way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLife for you.\" (for explanation, see Introduction\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto Surah Al-Ma'idah and its E. N. 15).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnother gain that accrued from the truce with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish was that being assured of peace from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsouth the Muslims overpowered all the opponent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tforces in the north and central Arabia easily.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJust three months after Hudaibiyah, Khaiber, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmajor stronghold of the Jews, was conquered and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tafter it the Jewish settlements of Fadak, Wad-il\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tQura, Taima and Tabuk also fell to Islam one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the other. Then all other tribes of central\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia, which were bound in alliance with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJews and Quraish, came under the sway of Islam.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThus, within two years after Hudaibiyah the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbalance of power in Arabia was so changed that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe strength of the Quraish and pagan gave way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand the domination of Islam became certain.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese were the blessings that the Muslims gained from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace treaty which they were looking upon as their defeat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Quraish as their victory. However, what had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttroubled the Muslims most in this treaty, was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition about the fugitives from Makkah and Madinah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the former would be returned and the latter would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot be returned. But not much long after- wards this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition also proved to be disadvantageous for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish, and experience revealed what far reaching\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequences of it had the Holy Prophet foreseen and then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccepted it. A few days after the treaty a Muslim of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah, Abu Basir, escaped from the Quraish and reached\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah. The Quraish demanded him back and the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet returned him to their men who had been sent from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah to arrest him. But while on the way to Makkah he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagain fled and went and sat on the road by the Red Sea\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshore, which the trade caravans of the Quraish took to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSyria. After that every Muslim who succeeded in escaping\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the Quraish would go and join Abu Basir instead of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoing to Madinah, until 70 men gathered there. They would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattack any Quraish caravan that passed the way and cut it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto pieces at last, the Quraish themselves begged the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet to call those men to Madinah, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition relating to the return of the fugitives of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\titself became null and void. The Surah should be read\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith this historical background in view in order to fully\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstand it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

In the first five\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverses they have been taught the manners they should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobserve with regard to Allah and His Messenger.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, they have been given the instruction that it is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright to believe in every news blindly and to act\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to it, without due thought. If information is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceived about a person, a group or a community, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be seen carefully whether the means of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinformation is reliable or not. If the means is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treliable, it should be tested and examined to see whether\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe news is authentic or not before taking any action on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, it has been told what attitude should the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims adopt in case two groups of the Muslims fall to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmutual fighting. Then the Muslims have been exhorted to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsafeguard against the evils that corrupt collective life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand spoil mutual relationships. Mocking and taunting each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother, calling others by nicknames, creating suspicions,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprying into other people's affairs and backbiting are the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevils which are not only sins in themselves but they also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorrupt society. Allah has mentioned all these evils\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseparately and forbidden them as unlawful.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, the national and racial distinctions that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcause universal corruption in the world have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondemned. Nations' and tribes' and families' pride of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tancestry and their looking down upon others as inferior\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto themselves and their pulling down others only for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsake of establishing their own superiority is an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant factor that has filled the world with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinjustices and tyranny. Allah in a brief verse has cut at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe root of this evil by stating that all men are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescendants of the same one pair and their division into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribes and communities is only for the sake of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecognition, not for boasting and pride, and there is no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlawful basis of one man's superiority over the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcept on the basis of moral excellence.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, the people have been told that the real\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthing is not the verbal Profession of the Faith but to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve in Allah and His messenger truly, to obey them in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractical life and to exert sincerely with one's self and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twealth in the cause of Allah. True believers are only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who adopt this attitude. As for those who profess\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam merely orally without affirmation by the heart and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen adopt an attitude as if they had done someone a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfavor by accepting Islam, may be counted among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims in the world, may even be treated as Muslims in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsociety, but they cannot be counted as believers in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsight of Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

A study of the subject\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter, however, reveals that its period of revelation is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe second stage of the Holy Prophet's life at Makkah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich lasted from the third year of the Prophethood till\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fifth year. We have given the characteristics of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod in the Introduction to the Surah Al-An'am. In view\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof those characteristics it can be said that this Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmight have been sent down in about the 5th year, when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tantagonism of the disbelievers had become quite intense\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut had not yet assumed tyrannical proportions.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Topics</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAuthentic traditions show that the Holy Prophet used to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecite this Surah generally in the Prayer on the Eid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays. A woman named Umm Hisham bin Harithah, who was a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneighbor of the Holy Prophet, says that she was able to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommit Surah Qaf to memory only because she often heard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit from the Holy Prophet in the Friday sermons. According\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto some other traditions he often recited it in the Fajr\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPrayer. This makes it abundantly clear that this was an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant Surah in the sight of the Holy Prophet. That is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhy he made sure that its contents reached as many people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas possible over and over again.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis reason for this importance can be easily understood\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby a careful study of the Surah. The theme of the entire\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah is the Hereafter. When the Holy Prophet started\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreaching his message in Makkah what surprised the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost was the news that people would be resurrected after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath, and they would have to render an account of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeeds. They said that that was impossible; human mind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould not believe that that would happen. After all, how\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould it be possible that when the body had disintegrated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto dust the scattered particles would be reassembled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter hundreds of thousands of years to make up the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbody once again and raised up as a living body, Allah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponse sent down this discourse. In it, on the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thand, arguments have been given for the possibility and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurrence of the Hereafter in a brief way, in short\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsentences, and, on the other, the people have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twarned, as if to say: \"Whether you express wonder and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurprise, or you regard it as something remote from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason, or deny it altogether, in any case it cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchange the truth. The absolute, unalterable truth is that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah knows the whereabouts of each and every particle of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour body that has scattered away in the earth, and knows\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhere and in what state it is. Allah's one signal is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenough to make all the scattered particles gather\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttogether again and to make you rise up once again as you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad been made in the first instance. Likewise, this idea\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat you have been created and left free to yourselves in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe world and that you have not been made answerable to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanyone, is no more than a misunderstanding. The fact is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat not only is Allah Himself directly aware of each act\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand word of yours, even of the ideas that pass in your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmind, but His angels also are attached to each one of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou, who are preserving the record of whatever you do and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tutter. When the time comes, you will come out of your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgraves at one call just as young shoots of vegetable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsprout up from the earth on the first shower of the rain.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen this heedlessness which obstructs your vision will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe removed and you will see with your own eyes all that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou are denying today. At that time you will realize that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou had not been created to be irresponsible in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld but accountable to all your deeds. The meting out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the rewards and punishments, the Hell and Heaven,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich you regard as impossible and imaginary things, will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat that time become visible realities for you. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequence of your enmity and opposition to the Truth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou will be cast into the same Hell which you regard as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremote from reason today and the ones who fear the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMerciful God and return to the path of righteousness,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill be admitted to the same Paradise at whose mention\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou now express wonder and surprise.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Someone thought that there would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno life-after-death; someone believed in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife-after-death, but in the form of the transmigration\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof souls; someone believed in the life hereafter and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeting out of the rewards and punishments but invented\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifferent sorts of props and supports to escape\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tretribution. About a question of such vital and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfundamental importance a wrong view of which renders\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman's whole life-work wrong and waste and ruins his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfuture for ever, it would be a disastrous folly to build\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan ideology only on the basis of speculation and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconjecture, without knowledge. It would mean that man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould remain involved in a grave misunderstanding, pass\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this whole life in the heedlessness of error, and after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath should suddenly meet with a situation for which he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad made no preparation at all. There is only one way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforming the right opinion about such a question, and it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis this: Man should seriously ponder over the knowledge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout the Hereafter that the Prophet of Allah is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconveying to him from Him, and should study carefully the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsystem of the earth and heavens and his own existence:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand should see whether the evidence of that knowledge's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing sound and correct is afforded by everything around\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim or not. In this regard, the arrangement of the wind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand rain, the structure of the earth and the creatures\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfound on it, man's own self, the creation of the heavens\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand of everything in the world in the form of pairs have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen presented as evidence of the Hereafter, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstances have been cited from human history to show that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe temper of the empire of the Universe requires that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe law of retribution must operate here.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, giving the invitation to Tauhid briefly, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been said: \"Your Creator has not created you for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tservice of others but for His own service. He is not like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour false gods, which receive sustenance from you and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgodhead of which cannot function without your help, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe is a God Who is the Sustainer of all, Who does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstand in need of sustenance from anyone and Whose Godhead\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis functioning by His own power and might.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this very connection, it has also been stated that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhenever the Prophets of Allah have been opposed and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresisted, they have not been opposed and resisted on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbasis of any rational ground but on the basis of the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobduracy and stubbornness and false pride that is being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshown against the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah be upon him), and there is no other motive for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit than rebellion and arrogance.

Then, it has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen stated as to what will be the fate of those who deny\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit when it actually occurs, and how will those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve in it and adopt the way of piety and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trighteousness accordingly, be blessed by Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, in the second section (vv. 29-49) the Quraish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchiefs' attitude towards the message of the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(peace and blessings of Allah he upon him) has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcriticized. They called him a sorcerer, a madman, or a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoet, and would thus mislead the common people against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim so that they should not pay any serious attention to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe message he preached. They looked upon him as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcalamity that had suddenly descended on them and would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topenly wish that he met with a disaster so that they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trid of him. They accused him of fabricating the Quran by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself and of presenting it in the name of Allah, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis was, God forbid, a fraud that he was practicing.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey would often taunt him, saying that God could not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave appointed an ordinary man like him to the office of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood. They expressed great disgust at his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvitation and message and would avoid him as if he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasking them for a reward for it. They would sit and take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcounsels together to devise schemes in order to put an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tend to his mission. And while they did all this they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnever realized what creeds of ignorance they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvolved in and how selflessly and sincerely was Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) exerting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself to deliver them from their error. While\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcriticizing them for this attitude and conduct, Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tput them certain questions, one after the other, each of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich is either an answer to some objection of theirs, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta criticism of some error. Then, it has been said that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould absolutely be of no avail to show them a miracle in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torder to convince them of his Prophethood, for they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch stubborn people as would misinterpret anything they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere shown only to avoid affirming the faith.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the beginning of this section as well as in its end,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim) has been given the instruction that he should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersistently continue giving his invitation and preaching\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this message in spite of the accusations and objections of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this opponents and enemies, and should endure their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresistance patiently till Allah's judgment comes to pass.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBesides, he has been consoled, as if to say \"Your Lord\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas not left you alone to face your enemies, after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\traising you as a Prophet, but He is constantly watching\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover you. Therefore, endure every hardship patiently till\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hour of His judgment comes, and seek through praising\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand glorifying your Lord the power that is required for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texerting in the cause of Allah under such conditions.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

The parts of this Hadith which have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treported by Aswad bin Yazid, Abu Ishaq and Zubair bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'awiyah from Hadrat Ibn Mas'ud, indicate that this is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe first Surah of the Quran, which the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had publicly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited before an assembly of the Quraish (and according\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Ibn Marduyah, in the Ka'bah) in which both the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers and the disbelievers were present. At the end,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen he recited the verse requiring the performance of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsajdah and fell down in prostration, the whole assembly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso fall down in prostration with him, and even those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchiefs of the polytheists who were in the forefront of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe opposition to the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah be upon him) could not resist falling down in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprostration. Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsays that he saw only one man, Umayyah bin Khalaf, from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the disbelievers, who did not fall down in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprostration but took a little dust and rubbing it on his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforehead said that that was enough for him. Later, as Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMas'ud relates, he saw this man being killed in the state\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof disbelief.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnother eye witness of this incident is Hadrat Muttalib\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Abi Wada'ah, who had not yet become a Muslim. Nasai\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Musnad Ahmad contain his own words to the effect:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"When the Holy Prophet recited the Surah An-Najm and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformed the sajdah and the whole assembly fell down in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprostration along with him, I did not perform the sajdah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow to compensate for the same whenever I recite this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah I make sure never to abandon its performance.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Sad says that before this, in the Rajab of the 5th\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyear of Prophethood, a small group of the Companions had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temigrated to Abyssinia. Then, when in the Ramadan of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame year this incident took place the news spread that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim) had recited Surah An-Najm publicly in the assembly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Quraish and the whole assembly, including the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers as well as the disbelievers, had fallen down in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprostration with him. When the emigrants to Abyssinia\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theard this news they formed the impression that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers of Makkah had become Muslims. Thereupon,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome of them returned to Makkah in the Shawwal of the 5th\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyear of Prophethood, only to learn that the news was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrong and the conflict between Islam and disbelief was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\traging as furiously as before. Concequently, the second\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temigration to Abyssinia took place, in which many more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople left Makkah. Thus, it becomes almost certain that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah was revealed in the Ramadan of 5th year of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Historical Background</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe details of the period of revelation as given above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoint to the conditions in which this Surah was revealed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDuring the first five years of his appointment as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe upon him) had been extending invitation to Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tReligion by presenting the Divine Revelations before the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople only in private and restricted meetings and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassemblies. During this whole period he could never have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta chance to recite the Quran before a common gathering\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topenly, mainly because of the strong opposition and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresistance from the disbelievers. They were well aware of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thow magnetic and captivating was the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonality and his way of preaching and how impressive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere the Revelations of the Quran. Therefore, they tried\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir best to avoid hearing it themselves and to stop\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers also from hearing it and to suppress his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvitation by false propaganda by spreading every kind of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuspicion against him. For this object, on the one hand,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were telling the people that Muhammad (peace and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessings of Allah be upon him) had gone astray and was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnow bent upon misleading others as well; on the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thand, they would raise an uproar whenever he tried to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresent the Quran before the people so that no one could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknow what it was for which he was being branded as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmisled and misguided person.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSuch were the conditions when the Holy Prophet (peace and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessings of Allah be upon him) suddenly stood up one day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto make a speech in the sacred precincts of the Ka'bah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhere a large number of the Quraish had gathered\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttogether. Allah at that time made him deliver this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscourse, which we have now in the form of the Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn-Najm with us. Such was the intensity of the impression\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat when the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe upon him) started reciting it the opponents were so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompletely overwhelmed that they could not think of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\traising any disorder, and when at the conclusion he fell\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown in prostration, they too fell down in prostration\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talong with him. Later they felt great remorse at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tweakness they had involuntarily shown. The people also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstarted taunting them to the effect that whereas they had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen forbidding others to listen to the Quran, that day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot only had they themselves listened to it, with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplete absorption but had even fallen down in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprostration along with Muhammad (peace and blessings of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah be upon him). At last, they had to invent a story\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin order to get rid of the people's taunt and ridicule.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey said, \"After he had recited afara'ait-ul Lata wal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUzza wa Manat ath-thalitha-al ukhra, we heard from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad the words: tilk al-gharaniqa- tal-'ula, wa anna\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshafa'at-u-hunna latarja: 'They are exalted goddesses:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindeed, their intercession may be expected.' From this we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstood that Muhammad had returned to our faith.\" As a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter of fact, only a mad person could think that in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontext of this Surah the sentences they claimed to have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theard could have any place and relevance.(For details,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplease see E. N.'s 96 to 301 of Surah Al Hajj).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Subject Matter and Topics</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe theme of the discourse is to warn the disbelievers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah about the error of the attitude that they had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadopted towards the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad (peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand blessings of Allah be upon him).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe discourse starts in a way as if to say: \"Muhammad is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneither deluded nor gone astray, as you are telling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers in your propaganda against him, nor has he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfabricated this teaching of Islam and its message, as you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseem to think he has. In fact, whatever he is presenting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis nothing but Revelation which is sent down to him. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverities that he presents before you, are not the product\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his own surmise and speculation but realities of which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the himself is an eye witness. He has himself seen the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAngel through whom this knowledge is conveyed to him. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been directly made to observe the great Signs of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLord: whatever he says is not what he has himself thought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout but what he has seen with his own eyes. Therefore,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour disputing and wrangling with him is just like the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisputing and wrangling of a blind man with a man of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsight over a thing which the blind man cannot see but he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcan see.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, three things have been presented in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuccessive order: First, the listeners have been made to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstand that: \"The religion that you are following is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbased on mere conjecture and invented ideas. You have set\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tup a few goddesses like Lat and Manat and Uzza as your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeities, whereas they have no share whatever in divinity.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYou regard the angels as the daughters of Allah, whereas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou regard a daughter as disgraceful for your own selves.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYou think that these deities of yours can influence Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin your favor, whereas the fact is that all the angels\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttogether, who are stationed closest to Allah, cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinfluence Him even in their own favor. None of such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeliefs that you have adopted, is based on knowledge and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason, but are wishes and desires for the sake of which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou have taken some whims as realities. This is a grave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\terror. The right and true religion is that which is in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconformity to the reality, and the reality is never\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubject to the people's wishes and desires so that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhatever they may regard as a reality and truth should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome the reality and truth. Speculation and conjecture\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot help to determine as to what is according to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruth and what is not; it is knowledge. When that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknowledge is presented before you, you turn away from it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand brand the one who tells you the truth as misguided.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe actual cause of your being involved in this error is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat you are heedless of the Hereafter. Only this world\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis your goal. Therefore, you have neither any desire for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe knowledge of reality, nor do you bother to see\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhether the beliefs you hold are according to the truth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor not.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSecondly, the people have been told that: Allah is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMaster and Sovereign of the entire Universe. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trighteous is he who follows His way, and the misguided he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho has turned away from His way. The error of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmisguided and the righteousness of the righteous are not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thidden from Him. He knows whatever everyone is doing: He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill requite the evil with evil and the good with good.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe final judgment will not depend on what you consider\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyourself to be, and on tall claims you make of your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurity and chastity but on whether you are pious or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timpious, righteous or unrighteous, in the sight of God.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf you refrain from major sins, He in His mercy will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toverlook your minor errors.''\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThirdly, a few basic principles of the true Religion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich had been presented hundreds of years before the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation of the Quran in the Books of the Prophets\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbraham and Moses have been reiterated so that the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid not remain involved in the misunderstanding that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim) had brought some new and novel religion, but they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould know that these are the fundamental truths which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe former Prophets of Allah have always been presenting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin their respective ages. Besides, the same Books have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen quoted to confirm the historical facts that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestruction of the 'Ad and the Thamud and of the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Prophets Noah and Lot was not the result of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccidental calamities, but Allah has destroyed them in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequence of the same wickedness and rebellion from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich the disbelievers of Makkah were not inclined to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefrain and desist in any case.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter presenting these themes and discourses the Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been concluded, thus: \"The Hour of Judgment has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapproached near at hand, which no one can avert. Before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe occurrence of that Hour you are being warned through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran in the like manner as the former people had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen warned before. Now, is it this warning that you find\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnovel and strange? Which you mock and ridicule? Which you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tturn away from and cause disorder so that no one else\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso is able to hear what it is? Don't you feel like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tweeping at your folly and ignorance? Abandon this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattitude and behaviour, bow down to Allah and serve Him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talone!\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis was that impressive conclusion hearing which even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe most hardened deniers of the Truth were completely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toverwhelmed, and when after reciting these verses of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDivine Word the Holy Messenger of Allah (peace and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessings of Allah be upon him) fell down in prostration,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey too could not help falling down in prostration along\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith him.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

The traditionists and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentators are agreed that this incident took place at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMina in Makkah about five years before the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thijra to Madinah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this Surah the disbelievers of Makkah have been warned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor their stubbornness which they had adopted against the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvitation of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah be upon him). The amazing and wonderful phenomenon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the splitting of the Moon was a manifest sign of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruth that the Resurrection, of which the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas giving them the news, could take place and that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad approached near at hand. The great sphere of the Moon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad split into two distinct parts in front of their very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teyes. The two parts had separated and receded so much\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapart from each other that to the on-lookers one part had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappeared on one side of the mountain and the other on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother side of it. Then, in an instant the two had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trejoined. This was a manifest proof of the truth that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsystem of the Universe was neither eternal nor immortal,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit could be disrupted. Huge stars and planets could split\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasunder, disintegrate, collide with each other, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teverything that had been depicted in the Quran in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconnection with the description of the details of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tResurrection, could happen. Not only this: it was also a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tportent that the disintegration of the system of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUniverse had begun and the time was near when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tResurrection would take place. The Holy Prophet (peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand blessings of Allah be upon him) invited the people's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattention to this event only with this object in view and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked them to mark it and be a witness to it. But the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers described it as a magical illusion add\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersisted in their denial. For this stubbornness they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been reproached in this Surah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt the outset it has been said: \"These people neither\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve in the admonition, nor learn a lesson from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory, nor affirm faith after witnessing manifest signs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith their eyes. Now they would believe only when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tResurrection has taken place and they would be rushing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout of their graves towards the Summoner on that Day.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, the stories of the people of Noah and of 'Ad and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThamud and of the peoples of Lot and the Pharaoh have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen related briefly and they have been reminded of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterrible punishments that these nations suffered when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey belied and disregarded the warnings given by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphets of God. After the narration of each story the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefrain that has been provided is: \"This Quran is an easy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeans of admonition, which if a nation takes to heart and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthereby takes the Right Way, the torment that descended\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the former nations could be avoided. But it would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindeed be a folly if instead of heeding the admonition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough this easy means, one persisted in heedlessness\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand disbelieved until one was overtaken by the torment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\titself.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLikewise, after citing admonitory precedents from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory of the former nations, the disbelievers at Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been addressed and warned to this effect: \"If you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoo adopt the same attitude and conduct for which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother nations have already been punished, why will you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot be punished for it?Are you in any way a superior\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople that you should be treated differently from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers?

This happened in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe 10th year of the Prophethood when the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad halted at Makkah on his way back from Ta'if. Although\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin some other traditions it has been reported that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet did not know then that the jinn were hearing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim recite the Quran, but afterwards Allah had informed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim of this, it is not unreasonable to suppose that just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas Allah had informed him of the jinn's hearing the Quran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso also Allah Himself might have told him as to what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanswer they were giving on hearing Surah Ar Rahman.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese traditions only indicate that Surah Ar Rahman had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen revealed even before Surahs Al-Hijr and Al-Ahqaf.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBesides, we come across another tradition which shows\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it is one of those Surahs which were the earliest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRevelations at Makkah. Ibn Ishaq has related this on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority of Hadrat Urwah bin Zubair: The Companions one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tday said to one another: \"The Quraish have never heard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany one recite the Quran publicly to them, and who would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tread out the Divine Word aloud to them? Hadrat Abdullah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Masud said that he would. The Companions expressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe apprehension that he might be subjected to a harsh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreatment and said that it should better be done by a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson of a powerful family, who would protect him if the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish tried to subject him to violence. Hadrat Abdullah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: 'Let me alone: my Protector is Allah.' So early\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnext morning he went to the Ka'bah while the Quraish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchiefs were sitting in their respective conferences.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Abdullah arrived at the Maqam (station of Abraham)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand began to recite Surah Ar-Rahman raising his voice as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the did so. The Quraish first tried for a while to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstand what he was saying. Then, when they realized\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it was the Word that Muhammad (peace and blessings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah be upon him) was representing as the Word of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod, they fell upon him and began to hit him in the face.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut Hadrat Abdullah was not deterred: he continued to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceive the slaps and to read the Quran as long as he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould. At last, when he returned with a swollen face, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions said that they apprehended the same. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied: 'God's enemies were never so light for me as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were today. If you say I'll recite the Quran to them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagain tomorrow.' They all said, 'No, you have done\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenough; you have made them listen to what they didn't\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twant to hear.'\" (Ibn Hisham, vol. 1, p. 336).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is the only Surah of the Quran in which besides men\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe jinn also, who are the other creation of the earth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tendowed with freedom of will and action, have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdirectly addressed, and both men and jinn have been made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto realize the wonders of Allah's power, His countless\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessings, their own helplessness and accountability\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore Him, and have been warned of the evil consequences\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof His disobedience and made aware of the best results of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis obedience.

They regarded all this as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timaginary, which could not possibly happen in actual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfact. In answer to this, it was said: \"When the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinevitable event will take place, there will be none to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelie its happening, nor will anyone have the Power to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tavert it, nor prove it to be an unreal happening.

In these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\targuments, apart from everything else that exists in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearth and heavens, man's attention has been drawn to his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\town body and to the food that he eats and to the water\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he drinks and to the fire on which he cooks his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfood, and he has been invited to ponder the question:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat right do you have to behave independently of, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tserve any other than, the God Whose creative power has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrought you into being, and Whose provisions sustain you?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd how can you entertain the idea that after having once\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrought you into existence He has become so helpless and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpowerless that He cannot recreate you once again even if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the wills to?\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, in vv. 75-82 their suspicions in respect of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran have been refuted and they have been made to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealize how fortunate they are that instead of deriving\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany benefit from the great blessing that the Quran is,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey are treating it with scant attention and have set\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly this share of theirs in it that they deny it. If one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseriously considers this matchless argument that has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresented in two brief sentences about the truth of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran, one will find in it the same kind of firm and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstable system as exists among the stars and planets of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Universe, and the same is the proof of the fact that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits Author is the same Being Who has created the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUniverse. Then the disbelievers have been told that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBook is inscribed in that Writ of Destiny which is beyond\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe reach of the creatures, as if to say \"You think it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrought down by the devils to Muhammad (peace and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessings of Allah be upon him), whereas none but the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpure angels has any access to the means by which it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treaches Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim) from the well guarded Tablet.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, man has been warned, as if to say: \"You\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmay brag and boast as you like and may shut your eyes to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe truths in your arrogance of independence, but death\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis enough to open your eyes.

This was the time when the tiny\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic State of Madinah had been hemmed in by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers and the handful of the ill equipped Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere entrenched against the combined power of entire\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia. In this state Islam not only stood in need of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrifice of Life from its followers, but it also needed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmonetary help and assistance. In this Surah a forceful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappeal has been made for the same. This view is further\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrengthened by verse 10 in which Allah has addressed the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers to the effect: \"Those of you who would spend\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand fight after the victory can never be equal to those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho have spent and fought before the victory.\" And the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame is supported by the traditions that Ibn Marduyah has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated on the authority of Hadrat Anas. In respect of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe verse Alam ya'n-i lilladhina aamanu an takhsha'a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqulubu- hum li-dhikrillah-i, he says that 17 years after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe commencement of the revelation of the Quran this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse was sent down to arouse the believers to action.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tReckoned thus the period of the revelation of this Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfalls between the 4th and the 5th year after the hijra.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe theme of this Surah is to exhort the Muslims to spend\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the cause of Allah. At the most critical juncture of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe history of Islam when it was engaged in a life and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath struggle against Arab paganism, this Surah was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed to persuade the Muslim's to make monetary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrifices in particular, and to make them realize that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam did not merely consist in verbal affirmation and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome outward practices but its essence and spirit is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsincerity towards Allah and His Religion. The faith of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe one who was devoid of this spirit and who regarded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this own self and wealth as dearer to himself than Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand His Religion, was hollow and therefore of little\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworth in the sight of Allah. For this object, first the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattributes of Allah Almighty have been mentioned so that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe listeners may fully realize as to Who is addressing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem. Then, the following themes have been expressed in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsequence:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe inevitable demand of the Faith is that one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tshould not shirk spending one's wealth for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsake of Allah. This would not only be contrary to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Faith but also wrong realistically. For the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twealth indeed belongs to Allah, on which man has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen given proprietary rights only as His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tvicegerent. Yesterday this wealth was in other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople's possession; today it is with one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tparticular man, and tomorrow it will pass into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsome one else's hand. Ultimately, it will go back\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto Allah, Who is the inheritor of everything in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe universe. Only that much of this wealth will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbe of any use to a man, which he spends in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcause of Allah during the period it is in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpossession.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlthough making sacrifices for the sake of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tis commendable in any case, the true worth of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthese sacrifices is determined by the nature of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe occasion. There is an occasion when the power\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof paganism is overwhelming and there is a danger\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it might subdue and overcome Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcompletely; there is another occasion when Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tis in a stronger position in its struggle against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tun-Islam and the believers are attaining\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tvictories.

As at the outset mention has been made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the woman who pleaded with the Holy Prophet (upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe Allah's peace) the case of zihar pronounced by her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thusband and urged him to suggest a way out of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifficult situation in order to save her and, her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchildren's life from ruin, and Allah has described her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpleading by the word \"mujadalah\", the Surah came to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknown by this very title. If it is read as \"mujadalah\" it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould mean \"pleading and arguing\", and if it is read as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"mujadilah\", it would mean \"the woman who pleaded and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\targued.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Period of Revelation</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere is no tradition to tell as to when this incident of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpleading and arguing took place, but there is a hint in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe subject matter of the Surah on the basis of which it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcan be said with certainty that it happened some time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the battle of the Trench (Shawwal, 5 A.H.). In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Al-Ahzab, Allah while negating that an adopted son\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould be one's real son, had just said this and no more;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"And Allah has not made those of your wives whom you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivorce by zihar your mothers.\" But in that Surah there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas nothing to the effect that to divorce a wife by zihar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas a sin or a crime, nor anything about the legal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinjunction concerning it. Contrary to it, in this Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe whole law relating to zihar has been laid down, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshows that these detailed injunctions were sent down some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime after the brief reference to it in Surah Al-Ahzab.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Subject Matter and Topics</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this Surah instructions have been given to the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout the different problems that confronted them at that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime. From the beginning of the Surah to verse 6 legal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinjunctions about zihar have been given, along with which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims have been strictly warned that it is contrary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto their profession of the Faith that they should still\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersist in the practices of ignorance after they have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccepted Islam, that they should break the bounds set by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, or refuse to abide by them, or that they should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake their own rules and regulations contradictory to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem. For this there is not only the punishment of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisgrace and humiliation in the world but in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter too there will be strict accountability for it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn vv. 7-10 the hypocrites have been taken to task for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir secret whisperings and consultations by which they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconspired and intrigued against the \"Holy Prophet (upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be Allah's peace and blessings), and because of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir hidden malice and grudge greeted him, like the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJews, in a manner as to wish him ill instead of well. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis connection, the Muslims have been consoled, as if to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay: \"These whisperings of the hypocrites can do no harm\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto you; therefore, you should go on doing your duty with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfull trust in Allah\". Besides, they have also been taught\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis moral lesson: \"The true believers, when they talk\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecretly together, do not talk of sin and transgression\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand disobedience to the Messenger if they have to talk\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecretly together they should talk of goodness and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpiety.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn vv. 11-13 the Muslims have been taught certain manners\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof social behavior and given instructions to eradicate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcertain social evils which were prevalent among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople then as they are today. If some people are sitting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin an assembly, and more people arrive, they do not show\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven the courtesy as to squeeze in so as to make room for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers, with the result that the new-comers have to keep\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstanding, or to sit in the door-way, or to go back, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseeing that there is enough room yet start jumping over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people's heads to find room for themselves. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toften used to be experienced in the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassemblies. Therefore, Allah gave the instruction, as if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto say: \"Do not behave selfishly and narrow mindedly in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour assemblies but do accommodate the new-comers also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith an open heart.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLikewise, another vice found among the people is that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen they go on a visit to somebody (an important person,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin particular), they prolong their sitting and do not at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall mind that encroaching upon his time unduly would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcause him hardship. Then, if he tells them to leave, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmind it; if he himself rises up from their assembly, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplain of his lack of manners; if he tells them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindirectly that he has some other business also to attend\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto, for which he needs time, they turn a deaf ear to his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trequest. The Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself also had to experience such misconduct of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople, who in their earnestness to benefit by his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteaching did not at all see that they were wasting his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprecious time so badly needed for other important works.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt last, Allah in order to eradicate this bad manner,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoined that when the people are asked to rise up from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan assembly, they should rise up and disperse.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnother vice prevalent among the people was that each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson wished to have secret counsel individually with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) without any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treal need, or would like that he should approach him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduring an assembly and whisper something to him. This was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot only embarrassing for the Holy Prophet but also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tannoying for the people who sat in the assembly. That is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhy Allah imposed the restriction that anyone who wanted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto consult him in private, should first give away\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething in charity. The object was that the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be warned of this bad manner and made to give it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tup. Thus, the restriction was kept in force for a short\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhile, and when the people had corrected their behavior,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit was withdrawn.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFrom verse 14 to the end of the Surah members of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim society, which was a mixture of the sincere\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims and the hypocrites and the waverers, have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttold plainly as to what is the criterion of sincerity in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam. One kind of Muslims are those who are friends with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe enemies of Islam: they do not hesitate for the sake\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof their interests to be treacherous to the religion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich they profess to believe in; they spread all sorts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof doubts and suspicions against Islam and prevent the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople from adopting the Way of Allah. But since they are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpart of the Muslim community their false profession of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFaith serves them as a cover and shield. The second kind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Muslims are those who, in the matter of Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tReligion, do not care even for their own father, brother,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchildren, and family, to say nothing of others. They do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot cherish any feeling of love for the person who is an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenemy of God and His Messenger and His Religion. Allah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese verses has explicitly stated that the people of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst kind, in fact, belong to Satan's party however hard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey may try to convince others of their Islam by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tswearing oaths. And the honor of belonging to Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparty is possessed only by the Muslims of the second\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkind. They alone are the true Muslims: they alone will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattain to true success, and with them alone is Allah well\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpleased.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

They have not left any writing of their own in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tform of a book or a tablet which might throw light on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir past, nor have the Jewish historians and writers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe non-Arab world made any mention of them, the reason\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing that after their settlement in the Arabian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeninsula they had detached themselves from the main body\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the nation, and the Jews of the world did not count\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem as among themselves. For they had given up Hebrew\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tculture and language, even the names, and adopted Arabism\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstead. In the tablets that have been unearthed in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarchaeological research in the Hejaz no trace of the Jews\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis found before the first century of the Christian era,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcept for a few Jewish names. Therefore, the history of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Arabian Jews is based mostly on the verbal traditions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevalent among the Arabs most of which bad been spread\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the Jews themselves.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Jews of the Hejaz claimed that they had come to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettle in Arabia during the last stage of the life of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Moses (peace be upon him). They said that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Moses had despatched an army to expel the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmalekites from the land of Yathrib and had commanded it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot to spare even a single soul of that tribe. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIsraelite army carried out the Prophet's command, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspared the life of a handsome prince of the Amalekite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tking and returned with him to Palestine. By that time the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Moses had passed sway. His successors took great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texception to what the army had done, for by sparing the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife of an Amalekite it had clearly disobeyed the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand violated the Mosaic law. Consequently, they excluded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe army from their community, and it had to return to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYathrib and settle there for ever.(Kitab al-Aghani, vol.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\txix, p. 94). Thus the Jews claimed that they had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tliving in Yathrib since about 1200 B.C. But, this had in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfact no historical basis and probably the Jews had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvented this story in order to overawe the Arabs into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieving that they were of noble lineage and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toriginal inhabitants of the land.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe second Jewish immigration, according to the Jews,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttook, place in 587 B.C. when Nebuchadnezzer, the king of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBabylon, destroyed Jerusalem and dispersed the Jews\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthroughout the world. The Arab Jews said that several of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir tribes at that time had come to settle in Wadi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Qura, Taima, and Yathrib.(Al-Baladhuri, Futuh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Buldan). But this too has no historical basis. By this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso they might have wanted to prove that they were the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toriginal settlers of the area.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs a matter of fact, what is established is that when in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA.D. 70 the Romans massacred the Jews in Palestine, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen in A.D. 132 expelled them from that land, many of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Jewish tribes fled to find an asylum in the Hejaz, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterritory that was contiguous to Palestine in the south.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere, they settled wherever they found water springs and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreenery, and then by intrigue and through money lending\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbusiness gradually occupied the fertile lands. Ailah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMaqna, Tabuk, Taima, Wadi al Qura, Fadak and Khaiber came\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunder their control in that very period, and Banl\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraizah, Bani al-Nadir, Bani Bahdal, and Bani Qainuqa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso came in the same period and occupied Yathrib.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmong the tribes that settled in Yathrib the Bani al\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNadir and the Bani Quraizah were more prominent for they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelonged to the Cohen or priest class. They were looked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon as of noble descent and enjoyed religious leadership\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong their co-religionists. When they came to settle in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah there were some other tribes living there before,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom they subdued and became practically the owners of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis green and fertile land. About three centuries later,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin A. D. 450 or 451, the great flood of Yaman occurred\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich has been mentioned in vv. 16-17 of Surah Saba\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove. As a result of this different tribes of the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Saba were compelled to leave Yaman and disperse in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifferent parts of Arabia. Thus, the Bani Ghassan went to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettle in Syria, Bani Lakhm in Hirah (Iraq), Bani Khuzaah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween Jeddah and Makkah and the Aus and the Khazraj\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twent to settle in Yathrib. As Yathrib was under Jewish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdomination, they at first did not allow the Aus and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhazraj to gain a footing and the two Arab tribes had to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettle on lands that had not yet been brought under\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcultivation, where they could hardly produce just enough\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto enable them to survive. At last, one of their chiefs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twent to Syria to ask for the assistance of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGhassanide brothers; he brought an army from there and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbroke the power of the Jews. Thus, the Aus and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhazraj were able to gain complete dominance over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYathrib, with the result that two of the major Jewish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribes, Bani an-Nadir and Bani Quraizaha were forced to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttake quarters outside the city. Since the third tribe,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBani Qainuqa, was not on friendly terms with the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo tribes, it stayed inside the city as usual, but had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto seek protection of the Khazraj tribe. As a counter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeasure to this Bani an-Nadir and Bani Quraizah took\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprotection of the Aus tribe so that they could live in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace in the suburbs of Yathrib.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBefore the Holy Prophet's arrival at Madinah until his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temigration the following were the main features of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJews' position in Hejaz in general and in Yathrib in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticular\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the matter of language, dress, civilization\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand way of life they had completely adopted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArabism, even their names had become Arabian. Of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe 12 Jewish tribes that had settled in Hejaz,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnone except the Bani Zaura retained its Hebrew\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tname. Except for a few scattered scholars none\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tknew Hebrew. In fact, there is nothing in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpoetry of the Jewish poets of the pre-Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdays to distinguish it from the poetry of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArab poets in language, ideas and themes. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\teven intermarried with the Arabs. In fact,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnothing distinguished them from the common Arabs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\texcept religion. Notwithstanding this, they had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnot lost their identity among the Arabs and had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tkept their Jewish prejudice alive most ardently\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand jealously. They had adopted superficial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArabism because they could not survive in Arabia\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twithout it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBecause of this Arabism the western orientals\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thave been misled into thinking that perhaps they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twere not really Israelites but Arabs who had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tembraced Judaism, or that at least majority of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthem consisted of the Arab Jews. But there is no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thistorical proof to show that the Jews ever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tengaged in any proselytizing activities in Hejaz,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tor their rabbis invited the Arabs to embrace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJudaism like the Christian priests and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmissionaries. On the contrary, we see that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprided themselves upon their Israelite descent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand racial prejudices. They called the Arabs the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGentiles, which did not mean illiterate or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tuneducated but savage and uncivilized people.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThey believed that the Gentiles did not possess\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tany human rights; these were only reserved for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Israelites, and therefore, it was lawful and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tright for the Israelites to defraud them of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tproperties by every fair and foul means. Apart\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the Arab chiefs, they did not consider the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcommon Arabs fit enough to have equal status with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthem even if they entered Judaism. No historical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tproof is available, nor is there any evidence in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Arabian traditions, that some Arab tribe or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprominent clan might have accepted Judaism.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, mention has been made of some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tindividuals, who had become Jews. The Jews,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, were more interested in their trade and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbusiness than in the preaching of their religion.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat is why Judaism did not spread as a religion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand creed in Hejaz but remained only as a mark of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpride and distinction of a few Israelite tribes.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Jewish rabbis, however, had a flourishing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbusiness in granting amulets and charms, fortune\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttelling and sorcery, because of which they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\theld in great awe by the Arabs for their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"knowledge\" and practical wisdom.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEconomically they were much stronger than the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArabs. Since they had emigrated from more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcivilized and culturally advanced countries of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPalestine and Syria, they knew many such arts as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twere unknown to the Arabs; they also enjoyed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade relations with the outside world. Hence,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthey had captured the business of importing grain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin Yathrib and the upper Hejaz and exporting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdried dates to other countries. Poultry farming\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand fishing also were mostly under their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcontrols. They were good at cloth weaving too.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThey had also set up wine shops here and there,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhere they sold wine which they imported from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSyria. The Bani Qainuqa generally practiced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcrafts such as that of the goldsmith, blacksmith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand vessel maker. In all these occupations, trade\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand business these Jews earned exorbitant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprofits, but their chief occupation was trading\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin money lending in which they had ensnared the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArabs of the surrounding areas. More particularly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe chiefs and elders of the Arab tribes who were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven to a life of pomp, bragging and boasting on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe strength of borrowed money were deeply\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tindebted to them. They lent money on high rates\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof interest and then would charge compound\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinterest, which one could hardly clear off once\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tone was involved in it. Thus, they had rendered\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Arabs economically hollow, but it had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnaturally induced a deep rooted hatred among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcommon Arabs against the Jews.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe demand of their trade and economic interests\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twas that they should neither estrange one Arab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttribe by befriending another, nor take part in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir mutual wars. But, on the other hand, it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\talso in their interests, that they should not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tallow the Arabs to be united and should keep them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfighting and entrenched against each other, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthey knew that whenever the Arab tribes united,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthey would not allow them to remain in possession\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof their 1arge properties, gardens and fertile\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlands, which they had come to own through their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprofiteering and money lending business.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFurthermore, each of their tribes also had to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tenter into alliance with one or another powerful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArab tribe for the sake of its own protection so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat no other powerful tribe should overawe it by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tits might. Because of this they had not only to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttake part in the mutual wars of the Arabs but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthey often had to go to war in support of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArab tribe to which their tribe was tied in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\talliance against another Jewish tribe which was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tallied to the enemy tribe. In Yathrib the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraizah and the Bani an-Nadir were the allies of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Aus while the Bani Qainuqa of the Khazraj. A\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlittle before the Holy Prophet's emigration,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthese Jewish tribes had confronted each other in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsupport of their respective allies in the bloody\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twar that took place between the Aus and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tKhazraj at Buath.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSuch were the conditions when Islam came to Madinah, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tultimately an Islamic State came into existence after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet's (upon whom be Allah's peace) arrival\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere. One of the first things that he accomplished soon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter establishing this state was unification of the Aus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Khazraj and the Emigrants into a brotherhood, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe second was that he concluded a treaty between the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims and the Jews on definite conditions, in which it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas pledged that neither party would encroach on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trights of the other, and both would unite in a joint\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefense against the external enemies. Some important\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclauses of this treaty are as follows, which clearly show\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat the Jews and the Muslims had pledged to adhere to in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir mutual relationship:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Jews must bear their expenses and the Muslims their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpenses. Each must help the other against anyone who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattacks the people of this document. They must seek\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmutual advice and consultation, and loyalty is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprotection against treachery. They shall sincerely wish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone another well. Their relations will be governed by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpiety and recognition of the rights of others, and not by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsin and wrongdoing. The wronged must be helped. The Jews\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmust pay with the believers so long as the war lasts.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYathrib shall be a sanctuary for the people of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdocument. If any dispute or controversy likely to cause\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrouble should arise, it must be referred to God and to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad the Apostle of God; Quraish and their helpers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshall not be given protection. The contracting parties\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare bound to help one another against any attack on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYathrib; Every one shall be responsible for the defense\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the portion to which he belongs\" (lbn Hisham, vol. ii,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpp. 147 to 150).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis was on absolute and definitive covenant to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions of which the Jews themselves had agreed. But\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot very long after this they began to show hostility\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttowards the Holy Prophet of Allah (upon whom be Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) and Islam and the Muslims, and their hostility and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperverseness went on increasing day by day. Its main\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcauses were three:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst, they envisaged the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace) merely as a chief of his people, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be content to have concluded a political agreement\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith them and should only concern himself with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworldly interests of his group. But they found that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas extending an invitation to belief in Allah and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tApostleship and the Book (which also included belief in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir own Prophets and scriptures), and was urging the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople to give up disobedience of Allah and adopt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobedience to the Divine Commands and abide by the moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlaws of their own prophets. This they could not put up\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith. They feared that if this universal ideological\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmovement gained momentum it would destroy their rigid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligiosity and wipe out their racial nationhood.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSecond, when they saw that the Aus and the Khazraj and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Emigrants were uniting into a brotherhood and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople from the Arab tribes of the surrounding areas, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentered Islam, were also joining this Islamic Brotherhood\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Madinah and forming a religious community, they feared\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the selfish policy that they had been following of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsowing discord between the Arab tribes for the promotion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof their own well being and interests for centuries,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould not work in the new system, but they would face a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunited front of the Arabs against which their intrigues\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand machinations would not succeed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThird, the work that the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be Allah's peace) was carrying out of reforming the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsociety and civilization included putting an end to all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunlawful methods in business and mutual dealings. More\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan that; he had declared taking and giving of interest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso as impure and unlawful earning. This caused them the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfear that if his rule became established in Arabia, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould declare interest legally forbidden, and in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey saw their own economic disaster and death.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor these reasons they made resistance and opposition to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet their national ideal. They would never\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thesitate to employ any trick and machination, any device\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand cunning, to harm him. They spread every kind of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfalsehood so as to cause distrust against him in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople's minds. They created every kind of doubt,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuspicion and misgiving in the hearts of the new converts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso as to turn them back from Islam. They would make false\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprofession of Islam and then would turn apostate so that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit may engender more and more misunderstandings among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople against Islam and the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace). They would conspire with the hypocrites\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto create mischief and would cooperate with every group\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand tribe hostile to Islam. They would create rifts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween the Muslims and would do whatever they could to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstir them up to mutual feuds and fighting. The people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Aus and the Khazraj tribes were their special target,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith whom they had been allied for centuries. Making\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmention of the war of Buath before them they would remind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem of their previous enmities so that they might again\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresort to the sword against each other and shatter their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbond of fraternity into which Islam had bound them. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould resort to every kind of deceit and fraud in order\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto harm the Muslims economically. Whenever one of those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith whom they had business dealings, would accept Islam,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey would do whatever they could to cause him financial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tloss. If he owed them something they would worry and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tharass him by making repeated demands, and if they owed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim something, they would withhold the payment and would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpublicly say that at the time the bargain was made he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprofessed a different religion, and since he had changed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this religion, they were no longer under any obligation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttowards him. Several instances of this nature have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcited in the explanation of verse 75 of Surah Al Imran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven in the commentaries by Tabari, Nisaburi, Tabrisi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand in Ruh al Ma'ani.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey had adopted this hostile attitude against the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcovenant even before the Battle of Badr. But when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twon a decisive victory over the Quraish at Badr, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere filled with grief and anguish, malice and anger.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey were in fact anticipating that in that war the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpowerful Quraish would deal a death blow to the Muslims.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThat is why even before the news of the Islamic victory\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treached Madinah they had begun to spread the rumor that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) had fallen\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta martyr and the Muslims had been routed, and the Quraish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarmy under Abu Jahl was advancing on Madinah. But when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe battle was decided against their hopes and wishes,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey burst with anger and grief. Ka'b bin Ashraf, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchief of the Bani an-Nadir, cried out: \"By God, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad has actually killed these nobles of Arabia, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearth's belly would be better for us than its back.\" Then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the went to Makkah and incited the people to vengeance by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twriting and reciting provocative elegies for the Quraish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchiefs killed at Badr. Then he returned to Madinah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomposed lyrical verses of an insulting nature about the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim women. At last, enraged with his mischief, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) sent Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Maslamah Ansari in Rabi al-Awwal, A. H. 3, and had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim slain. Ibn Sad, Ibn Hisham, Tabari).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe first Jewish tribe which, after the Battle of Badr,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topenly and collectively broke their covenant were the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBani Qainuqa. They lived in a locality inside the city of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah. As they practiced the crafts of the goldsmith,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblacksmith and vessel maker, the people of Madinah had to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvisit their shops fairly frequently. They were proud of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir bravery and valor. Being blacksmiths by profession\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven their children were well armed, and they could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstantly muster 700 fighting men from among themselves.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey were also arrogantly aware that they enjoyed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelations of confederacy with the Khazraj and Abdullah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Ubbay, the chief of the, Khazraj, was their chief\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupporter. At the victory of Badr, they became so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovoked than they began to trouble and harass the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims and their women in particular, who visited their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshops. By and by things came to such a pass that one day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta Muslim woman was stripped naked publicly in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbazaar. This led to a brawl in which a Muslim and a Jew\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere killed. Thereupon the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace) himself visited their locality, got them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttogether and counseled them on decent conduct. But the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treply that they gave was; \"O Muhammad, you perhaps think\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twe are like the Quraish; they did not know fighting;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore, you overpowered them. But when you come in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontact with us, you will see how men fight.\" This was in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclear words a declaration of war. Consequently, the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (upon whom be Allah's peace) laid siege to their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquarters towards the end of Shawwal (and according to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome others, of Dhi Qa'dah) A.H. 2. The siege had hardly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlasted for a fortnight when they surrendered and all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir fighting men were tied and taken prisoners. Now\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdullah bin Ubayy came up in support of them and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinsisted that they should be pardoned. The Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconceded his request and decided that the Bani Qainuqa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be exiled from Madinah leaving their properties,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarmor and tools of trade be- hind.(Ibn Sa'd, Ibn Hisham,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTarikh Tabari).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor some time after these punitive measures (i.e. the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbanishment of the Qainuqa and killing of Ka'b bin Ashraf\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Jews remained so terror stricken that they did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdare commit any further mischief. But later when in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tShawwal, A. H. 3, the Quraish in order to avenge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves for the defeat at Badr, marched against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah with great preparations, and the Jews saw that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly a thousand men had marched out with the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be Allah's peace) as against three thousand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen of the Quraish, and even they were deserted by 300\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites who returned to Madinah, they committed the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst and open breach of the treaty by refusing to join\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet in the defense of the city although they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere bound to it. Then, when in the Battle of Uhud the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims suffered reverses, they were further emboldened.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSo much so that the Bani an-Nadir made a secret plan to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkill the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthough the plan failed before it could be executed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to the details, after the incident of Bi'r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMaunah (Safar, A.H. 4) Amr bin Umayyah Damri slew by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmistake two men of the Bani Amir in retaliation, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactually belonged to a tribe which was allied to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims, but Amr had mistaken them for the men of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenemy. Because of this mistake their blood money became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligatory on the Muslims. Since the Bani an-Nadir were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso a party in the alliance with the Bani Amir, the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (upon whom be Allah's peace) went to their clan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talong with some of his Companions to ask for their help\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin paying the blood money. Outwardly they agreed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontribute, as he wished, but secretly they plotted that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta person should go up to the top of the house by whose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twall the Holy Prophet was sitting and drop a rock on him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto kill him. But before they could execute their plan,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah informed him in time and be immediately got up and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturned to Madinah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow there was no question of showing them any further\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcession. The Holy Prophet at once sent to them the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tultimatum that the treachery they had meditated against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim had come to his knowledge; therefore, they were to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleave Madinah within ten days; if anyone of them was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfound staying behind in their quarters, he would be put\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the sword. Meanwhile Abduliah bin Ubayy sent them the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage that he would help them with two thousand men and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Bani Quraizah and Bani Ghatafan also would come\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto their aid; therefore, they should stand firm and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould not go. On this false assurance they responded to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet's ultimatum saying that they would not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleave Madinah and he could do whatever was in his power.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConsequently, in Rabi' al-Awwal, A.H. 4, the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be Allah's peace) laid siege to them, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter a few days of the siege (which according to some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditions were 6 and according to others 15 days) they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagreed to leave Madinah on the condition that they could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tretain all their property which they could carry on thee\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcamels, except the armour. Thus, Madinah was rid of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecond mischievous tribe of Jews. Only two of the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan-Nadir became Muslims and stayed behind. Others went to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSyria and Khaiber.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe theme of the Surah as stated above, is an appraisal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the battle against the Bani an Nadir. In this, on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole, four things have been discussed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the first four verses the world has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tadmonished to take heed of the fate that had just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbefallen the Bani an-Nadir. A major tribe which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twas as strong in numbers as the Muslims, whose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople boasted of far more wealth and possession\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twho were by no means ill-equipped militarily and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhose forts were well fortified could not stand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsiege even for a few days, and expressed their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treadiness to accept banishment from their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcenturies-old, well established settlement even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthough not a single man from among them was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tslain. Allah says that this happened not because\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof any power possessed by the Muslims but because\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Jews had tried to resist and fight Allah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHis Messenger, and those who dare to resist the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpower of Allah, always meet with the same fate.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn verse 5, the rule of the law of war that has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen enunciated is: the destruction caused in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tenemy territory for military purposes does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcome under \"spreading mischief in the earth.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn vv. 6-10 it has been stated how the lands and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tproperties which come under the control of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic State as a result of war or peace terms,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tare to be managed. As it was the first ever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\toccasion that the Muslims took control of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconquered territory, the law concerning it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlaid down for their guidance.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(4) In vv. 11-17 the attitude that the hypocrites had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadopted on the occasion of the battle against the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan-Nadir has been reviewed and the causes underlying it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been pointed out.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(5) The whole of the last section (vv. 18-24) is an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmonition for all those people who had professed to have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffirmed the faith and joined the Muslim community, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere devoid of the true spirit of the faith. In it they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been told what is the real demand of the Faith, what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the real difference between piety and wickedness, what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the place and importance of the Quran which they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprofessed to believe in, and what are the attributes of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod in Whom they claimed to have believed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

The first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelates to Hadrat Hatib bin Abz Balta'a, who, a little\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the conquest of Makkah, had sent a secret letter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Quraish chiefs informing them of the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's intention to attack them. The second relates to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslim women, who had started emigrating from Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Madinah, after the conclusion of the Truce of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHudaibiyah, and the problem arose whether they also were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto be returned to the disbelievers, like the Muslim men,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to the conditions of the Truce. The mention of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese two things absolutely determines that this Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame down during the interval between the Truce of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHudaibiyah and the Conquest of Makkah. Besides, there is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta third thing also that has been mentioned at the end of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Surah to the effect; What should the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be Allah's peace) make the women to pledge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen they come to take the oath of allegiance before him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas believers?About this part also the guess is that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoo was sent down some time before the conquest of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah, for after this conquest a large number of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish women, like their men, were going to enter Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimultaneously and had to be administered the oath of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallegiance collectively.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Topics</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis Surah has three parts;\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe first part consists of vv. 1-9, and the concluding\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse 13 also relates to it. In this strong exception has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen taken to the act of Hadrat Hatib bin Abi Balta'a in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he had tried to inform the enemy of a very important\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twar secret of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) only for the sake of safe guarding his family.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis would have caused great bloodshed at the conquest of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah had it not been made ineffective in time. It would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave cost the Muslims many precious lives; many of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish would have been killed, who were to render great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tservices to Islam afterward; the gains which were to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccrue from conquering Makkah peacefully would have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlost, and all these serious losses would have resulted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly because one of the Muslims had wanted to safeguard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this family from the dangers of war. Administering a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsevere warning at this blunder Allah has taught the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers the lesson that no believer should, under any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcircumstances and for any motive, have relations of love\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand friendship with the disbelievers, who are actively\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thostile to Islam, and a believer should refrain from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teverything which might be helpful to them in the conflict\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween Islam and disbelief. However, there is no harm in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdealing kindly and justly with those disbelievers, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmay not be practically engaged in hostile activities\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst Islam and persecution of the Muslims.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe second part consists of vv. 10-11. In this a social\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproblem has been settled, which was agitating the minds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat that time. There were many Muslim women in Makkah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhose husbands were pagans, but they were emigrating and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treaching Madinah somehow. Likewise, there were many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim men in Madinah, whose wives were pagans and had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen left behind in Makkah. The question arose whether\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe marriage bond between them continued to be valid or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot. Allah settled this problem for ever, saying that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpagan husband is not lawful for the Muslim women, nor the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpagan wife lawful for the Muslim husband. This decision\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleads to very important legal consequences, which we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshall explain in our notes below.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe third section consists of verse 12, in which the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (upon whom be Allah's peace) has been instructed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto ask the women who accept Islam to pledge that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould refrain from the major evils that were prevalent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the womenfolk of the pre-Islamic Arab society, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto promise that they would henceforth follow the ways of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoodness which the Messenger of Allah may enjoin.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Some verses are addressed to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst two groups, some only to the hypocrites, and some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly to the sincere Muslims.

In spite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof acknowledging the Prophet Moses as a Messenger of God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey continued to malign him as long as he lived, and in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspite of witnessing clear signs from the Prophet Jesus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey denied him without any hesitation. Consequently, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIsraelites became perverse, incapable of benefiting from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivine guidance. This is certainly not an enviable state\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich another nation should imitate. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, in vv. 8-9 a proclamation has been made with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchallenge: \"The Jews and the Christians, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites, who are conspiring with them, may try however\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thard they may to extinguish this Light of Allah, it will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshine forth and spread in the world in all its fullness,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Religion brought by the true Messenger of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshall prevail over every other religion however hateful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit may be to the pagans and polytheists. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn vv. 10-13, the believers have been told that the way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto success both here and in the Hereafter is only one:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they should believe in Allah and His Messenger\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsincerely and should exert their utmost in Allah's Way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith their selves and their wealth.

The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident that has been referred to in the last verse of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis section must have occurred at a time when the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad not yet received full training in the etiquette of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligious congregations. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs we have explained above, the two sections of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah were sent down in two different periods.

Although there is a kind of harmony between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem on account of which they have been put together in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone Surah, yet we should understand their themes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseparately before we consider the question of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tharmony.  \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe first section was sent down at a time when all Jewish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tefforts to obstruct the message of Islam during the past\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsix years had failed. First, in Madinah as many as three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof their powerful tribes had done whatever they could to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrustrate the mission of the Holy Prophet, with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresult that one of the tribes was completely exterminated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the other two were exiled. Then by intrigue and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconspiracy they brought many of the Arab tribes together\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto advance on Madinah, but in the Battle of the Trench\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were all repulsed. After this, Khaiber had become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir stronghold, where a large number of the Jews\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpelled from Madinah also had taken refuge. At the time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese verses were revealed, that too was taken without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany extraordinary effort, and the Jews at their own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trequest agreed to live there as tenants of the Muslims.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this final defeat the Jewish power in Arabia came\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto an end. Then, Wad-il-Qura, Fadak Taima', Tabuk, all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurrendered one after the other, so much so that all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabian Jews became subdued to the same Islam which they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere not prepared to tolerate before. This was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccasion when Allah Almighty once again addressed them in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah, and probably this was the last and final\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taddress that was directed to them in the Quran. In this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey have been reminded of three things:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"You refused to believe in this Messenger only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause he was born among a people whom you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcontemptuously call the \"gentiles\". You were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tunder the false delusion that the Messenger must\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessarily belong to your own community. You\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tseemed to have been convinced that anyone who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tclaimed to be a prophet from outside your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcommunity, must be an impostor for this office\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thad been reserved for your race, and a messenger\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcould never be raised among the \"gentiles\". But\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the same gentiles Allah has raised a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger who is reciting His Book in front of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tyour very eyes, is purifying souls, and showing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Right Way to the people whose misdeeds are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twell known to you . This is Allah's bounty, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHe may bestow on anyone He may please. You have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tno monopoly over it so that He may bestow it over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhomever you may please and may withhold it from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhomever you may desire it to be withheld.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"You had been made bearers of the Torah, but you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdid not understand your responsibility for it nor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdischarged it as you should have. You are like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe donkey which is loaded with books, and which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes not know what burden it is bearing. Rather\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tyou are worse than the donkey, for the donkey is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdevoid of sense, but you are intelligent. You not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tonly shirk your responsibility of being bearers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah's book, but you do not even hesitate to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdeny Allah's revelations deliberately. Yet, you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tare under the delusion that you are Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfavourites and the blessing of apostleship has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen reserved for you alone. More than that, you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tseem to entertain the notion that whether you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfulfill the demands of Allah's message or not,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah in any case is bound not to make any other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthan you the bearer of His message.\" \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"If you really were Allah's favorites and you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twere sure of having a place of honor and high\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trank reserved with Him, you would not have feared\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath so much as to prefer a life of disgrace to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath. It is only because of this fear of death\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat you have suffered humiliation after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thumiliation during the past few years. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition is by itself a proof that you are fully\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconscious of your misdeeds, and your conscience\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tis aware that if you die with these misdeeds, you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twill meet with a greater disgrace before Allah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hereafter than in this world.\" \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is the subject matter of the first section. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecond section that was sent down many years later, was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappended to this Surah because in it Allah has bestowed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFriday on the Muslims as against the Sabbath of the Jews,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Allah wanted to warn the Muslims not to treat their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFriday as the Jews had treated their Sabbath. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsection was sent down on an occasion when a trade caravan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarrived in Madinah right at the time of the Friday\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcongregational service and hearing its din and drum the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taudience, except for 12 men, left the Prophet's Mosque\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand rushed out to the caravan, although the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be Allah's peace) at that time was delivering\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Sermon. Thereupon it was enjoined that after the call\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis sounded for the Friday Prayer all trade and business\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand other occupations become forbidden. The believers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould then suspend every kind of transaction and hasten\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the remembrance of Allah. However, when the Prayer is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover, they have the right to disperse in the land to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresume their normal occupations. This section could be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade an independent Surah in view of the commandments\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it contains about the congregational service on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFriday, and could also be included in some other Surah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut, instead, it has been included here particularly in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe verses in which the Jews have been warned of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcauses of their evil end. Its wisdom in our opinion is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same as we have explained above. \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Before the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temigration to Madinah the tribes of the Aus and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhazraj, fed up with their mutual rivalries and civil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twars, had almost agreed on the leadership of one man and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere making preparations to crown him their king. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul, the chief of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhazraj. Muhammad bin Ishaq has stated that among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of Khazraj his authority was never contested and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnever had the Aus and the Khazraj rallied to one man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore this.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSuch were the conditions when the voice of Islam reached\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah and the influential people of both the tribes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstarted becoming Muslims. When before the Emigration,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvitation was being extended to the Holy Prophet (upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be Allah's peace) to come to Madinah, Hadrat Abbas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Ubadah bin Nadlah Ansari wanted to defer this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvitation for the reason that Abdullah bin Ubayy also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmight join in the declaration of allegiance and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvitation to the Holy Prophet, so that Madinah might\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome the center of Islam by common consent. But the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdelegation that arrived in Makkah to declare their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallegiance did not give any importance to the proposal of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbbas bin Ubadah, and a11 its members, who included 75\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen from both the tribes, became ready to invite the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet in the face of every danger (Ibn Hisham, vol. II,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tp. 89). We have given the details of this event in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIntroduction to Surah Al-Anfal.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, when the Holy Prophet arrived in Madinah, Islam had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso deeply penetrated every house of the Ansar that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdullah bin Ubayy became helpless and did not see any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother way to save his leadership than to become a Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself. So, he entered Islam along with many of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowers from among the chiefs and leaders of both the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribes although their hearts were burning with rage from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithin. Ibn Ubayy in particular was filled with grief,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeprived him of his kingship. For several years his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocritical faith and grief of being deprived of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkingdom manifested itself in different ways. On the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thand, when on Fridays the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace) took his seat to deliver the Sermon,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdullah bin Ubayy would stand up and say \"O people, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah is present among you, by whom Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas honored you; therefore, you should support him and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlisten to what he says and obey him.\" (Ibn Hisham, vol.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIII, p. 111). On the other, his hypocrisy was being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texposed day by day and the true Muslims were realizing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he and his followers bore great malice against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam, the Holy Prophet and the Muslims.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOnce when the Holy Prophet was passing on the way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdullah bin Ubayy spoke to him in harsh words. When the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet complained of it to Hadrat Sa'd bin Ubadah;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the said: \"O Messenger of Allah, don't be hard on him, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen Allah sent you to us we were making a diadem to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcrown him, and, by God, he thinks that you have robbed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim of his kingdom.\" (Ibn Hisham vol: II, pp. 237-238).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter the Battle of Badr when the Holy Prophet (upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe Allah's peace) invaded the Jewish tribe of Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQainuqa on their breaking the agreement and unprovoked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevolt, this man stood up in support of them, and holding\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet by his armor, said: \"These 700 fighters\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been helping and protecting me against every enemy;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould you cut them down in one morning? By God, I will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot leave you until you pardon my clients.\" (Ibn Hisham,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvol. III, pp. 5l-52).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the occasion of the Battle of Uhud this man committed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topen treachery and withdrew from the battlefield with 300\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his companions. One should note that at this critical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmoment when he so acted, the Quraish had marched upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah with 3,000 troops and the Holy Prophet had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarched out with only 1,000 men to resist them. Of these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t1,000 this hypocrite broke away with 300 men and the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet was left with only 700 men to meet 3,000 troops\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the enemy in the field.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this incident the common Muslims of Madinah came to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealize fully that he was certainly a hypocrite and those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions also were found who were his associates in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrisy. That is why when on the very first Friday,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the Battle of Uhud, this man stood up as usual to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake a speech before the Holy Prophet's Sermon, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople pulled at his garment, saying \"Sit down you are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot worthy to say such things.\" That was the first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccasion in Madinah when this man was publicly disgraced.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThereupon he was so filled with rage that he left the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmosque jumping over the heads of the people. At the door\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Mosque some of the Ansar said to him, \"What are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou doing? Go back and ask the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace) to pray for your forgiveness.\" He retorted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"I do not want him to pray for my forgiveness.\" (Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHisham, vol. III, p. 111).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen in A.H. 4 the Battle of Bani an-Nadir took place. On\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis occasion he and his companions supported the enemies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Islam even more openly. On the one side, the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and his devoted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions were preparing for war against their enemy,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Jews, and on the other, these hypocrites were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecretly sending messages to the Jews to the effect:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Stand firm we are with you: if you are attacked, we will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelp you, and if you are driven out, we too will go out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith you.\" The secret of this intrigue was exposed by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah Himself, as has been explained in Surah Al-Hashr:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t11-17 above.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut in spite of being so exposed the reason why the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (upon whom be Allah's peace) was still treating\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim kindly was that he had a large band of the hypocrites\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehind him. Many of the chiefs of both the Aus and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhazraj were his supporters. At least a third of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpopulation of Madinah consisted of his companions, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecame manifest on the occasion of the Battle of Uhud.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUnder such conditions it was not prudent to wage a war\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith these internal enemies combined with the external\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenemies. On this very account, in spite of being fully\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taware of their hypocrisy the Holy Prophet continued to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeal with them according to their apparent profession of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaith for a long time. On the other hand, these people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoo neither possessed the power nor the courage to fight\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe believers openly as disbelievers, or to join hands\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith an invader and face them in the battlefield.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tApparently they were a strong hand but inwardly they had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe weakness which Allah has vividly portrayed in Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Hashr: 12-14. Therefore; they thought their wellbeing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlay only in posing as Muslims. They came to the mosque,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffered the prayers, gave away the zakat, and would make\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttall oral claims to the faith, which the true Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnever felt the need to do. They would offer a thousand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjustifications for each of their hypocritical acts by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich they would try to deceive their compatriots, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnsar, into believing that they were with them. By these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdesigns they were not only saving themselves from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisadvantages which could naturally accrue if they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseparated themselves from the Ansar brotherhood, but also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaking advantage of the opportunities to make mischief\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich were available to them as members of the Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrotherhood.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese were the causes which enabled Abdullah bin Ubayy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand like minded hypocrites to get an opportunity to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccompany the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin his campaign against the Bani al-Mustaliq, and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimultaneously engineered two great mischiefs which could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshatter the Muslim unity to pieces. However, by virtue of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe wonderful training in discipline that the Muslims had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceived through the pure teaching of the Quran and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanionship of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboth mischiefs were stopped in time, and the hypocrites\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves were disgraced instead. One of these was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmischief that has been mentioned in Surah An-Nur above,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the other which has been mentioned in this Surah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis incident has been related by Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmad,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNasai, Tirmidhi, Baihaqi, Tabari, Ibn Marduyah, Abdur\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRazzaq, Ibn Jarir Tabari, Ibn Sa'd and Muhammad bin Ishaq\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough many reliable channels. In some traditions the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpedition in which it took place has not been named, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin others it has been connected with the Battle of Tabuk.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut the authorities on the battles fought by the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet and history are agreed that this incident took\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplace on the occasion of the campaign against the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Mustaliq. The following seems to he the real story\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen all the traditions are read together.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen after crushing down the power of Bani al-Mustaliq\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Islamic army had made a halt in the settlement at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell of al Muraisi. Suddenly a dispute arose between two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen on taking water from the well; One of them was Jehjah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Masud Ghifari, a servant of Hadrat Umar appointed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlead his horse. The other was Sinan bin Wabar al-Juhani,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhose tribe was an ally of a clan of the Khazraj. Harsh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords between them led to fighting and Jehjah kicked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSinan, which the Ansar, on account of their ancient\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYamanite tradition, took as a great insult and disgrace.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt this Sinan called out the men of Ansar and Jehjah the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmigrants for help. Hearing about the quarrel Ibn Ubayy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstarted inciting and calling the men of the Aus and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhazraj to come out and help their ally. From the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tside some Emigrants also came out. The dispute might have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tled to a fight between the Ansar and the Muhajirin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves at the very place where they had just fought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan enemy tribe jointly and crushing it had halted in its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\town territory. But hearing the noise the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) emerged and said: \"What is this call\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof paganism? What have you to do with such a call? Leave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit: it is a dirty thing.\" Thereupon the leading men of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe two sides met and settled the dispute; Sinan pardoned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJehjah and peace was restored.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this every person whose heart was disaffected came\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Abdullah hin Ubayy and they all said to him, \"Until\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnow we had our hopes attached to you and you were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprotecting us, but now it seems you have become a helper\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof these paupers against us.\" Ibn Ubayy was already\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenraged: These words made him burst out, thus: \"This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat you have done to yourselves. You have given these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople shelter in your country, and have divided your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty among them. So much so that they have now become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tour rivals. Nothing so fits us and the paupers of Quraish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(or the Companions of Muhammad) as the ancient saying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Feed your dog to fatten it and it will devour you.' If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou hold back your property from them, they would go\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telsewhere. By God, when we return to Madinah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thonorable ones will drive out from it the mean ones.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZaid bin Arqam, a young boy, also happened to be present\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the assembly at that time. He heard this and mentioned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit before his uncle, and his uncle who was one of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnsar chiefs went to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) and told him the whole story. The Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcalled Zaid and asked him what had happened and he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepeated every word of what he had heard. The Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet said, \"Zaid, you are perhaps displeased with Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUbayy; you might have been mistaken in hearing; you might\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave imagined Ibn Ubayy said this.\" But Zaid was sure and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirm. He said, \"No, I swear by God I have heard him say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis and that.\" Thereupon the Holy Prophet called Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUbayy, and he came and swore that he had not said any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch thing. The people of the Ansar also said \"Sir, a boy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsays this: he might have been mistaken in what he heard.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Ubayy is a venerable old man and our chief. Do not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve what a boy says against him.\" The elderly people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the tribe reproved Zaid also, who became depressed and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theld his peace. But the Holy Prophet knew Zaid as well as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdullah bin Ubayy. Therefore, he fully understood what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad actually happened.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen Hadrat Umar came to know of this, he came to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet and said: \"Please allow me to put this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrite to the sword. Or, if you do not think it is fit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto give me the permission you may tell Muadh bin Jabal,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor Abbad bin Bishr, or Sad bin Mu'adh, or Muhammad bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMaslamah from among the Ansar, to go and kill him.\" But\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet said: \"No, the people will say Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkills his own Companions.\" After this he ordered the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople to set off immediately, although it was at a time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen the Holy Prophet was not accustomed to travel. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforced march continued for 30 hours at a stretch so that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people became exhausted. Then he halted, and as soon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas they touched the ground they fell asleep. This he did\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto distract their minds from what had happened at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell of al-Muraisi. On the way, Hadrat Usaid bin Hudair,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan Ansar chief, met the Holy Prophet, and said: \"O\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah, today you ordered the people to set\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toff at a time which was disagreeable for traveling, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthing you have never done before.\" The Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied: \"Have you. not heard of what your friend said?\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen he asked who he meant, the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied:Abdullah bin Ubayy. He asked what he had said.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Holy Prophet answered: \"He has asserted that when he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturns to Madinah the honorable ones will drive out from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit the mean ones. He answered: \"By God, O Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, you are the honorable one and he is the mean one;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou will drive him out whenever you want to.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBy and by the news spread among the Ansar soldiers and it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenraged them against Ibn Ubayy. The people advised him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgo to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trequest for his forgiveness, but he retorted : \"You asked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tme to believe in him, and I believed in him; you asked me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto pay the zakat on my property, and I paid the zakat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoo; now the only thing left is that I should bow down to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad.\" This further enraged the believing Ansar and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teveryone started reproaching and cursing him roughly.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the caravan was about to enter Madinah, Abullah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tson of Abdullah bin Ubayy, stood before his father with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdrawn out sword, and said: \"You had said that when you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treached Madinah, the honorable ones would drive out the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmean ones. Now, you will know who is honorable, you or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah and His Messenger. By God, you cannot enter Madinah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuntil the Messenger of Allah (upon whom be Allah's peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermits you to enter.\" At this Ibn Uhayy cried out: \"O\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of Khazraj, look, my own son is preventing me from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentering Madinah.\" The people conveyed this news to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet, and he said : \"Tell Abdullah to let his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfather come home.\" Abdullah said, \"If this is the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's order, then you may enter.\" Thereupon the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet said to Hadrat Umar: \"Now what do you think,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUmar? Had you killed him on the day when you asked my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermission to kill him, many people woujd have trembled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith rage. Today if I order them to kill him, they will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkill him immediately.\" Hadrat Umar replied, \"By God, I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealize there was greater wisdom behind what the Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah said than what I said.\" These were the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcircumstances under which this Surah was sent down most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprobably after the Holy Prophet's return to Madinah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

But the majority of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentators regard the whole of the surah as a Madinan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRevelation. Although there is no internal evidence to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelp determine its exact period of revelation, yet a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstudy of its subject matter shows that it might probably\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been sent down at an early stage at Madinah. That is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhy it partly resembles the Makkah surahs and partly the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinan Surahs.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe theme of this surah is invitation to the Faith and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobedience (to Allah) and the teaching of good morals. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsequence followed is that the first four verses are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taddressed to all men; verses 5-10 to those men who do not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve in the invitation of the Quran; and verses 11-18\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto those who accept and believe in this invitation. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe verses addressed to all men, they have been made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taware in a few brief sentences of the four fundamental\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruths:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst, that the universe in which they live is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGodless, but its Creator, Master and Ruler is an All\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPowerful God, and everything in it testifies to His being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost Perfect and absolutely faultless.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSecond, that the universe is not without purpose and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twisdom, but its Creator has created it with truth; no one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be under the delusion that it is a mock show,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich began without a purpose and will come to an end\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout a purpose.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThird, that the excellent form that God has created you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith and the choice that He has given you to choose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween belief and unbelief is not a useless and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaningless activity so that it may be of no consequence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhether you choose belief or unbelief. In fact, God is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twatching as to how you exercise your choice.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFourth, that you have not been created irresponsible and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunanswerable. You have to return ultimately to your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCreator, and have to meet the Being who is aware of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teverything in the universe, from Whom nothing is hidden,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Whom even the innermost thoughts of the minds are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknown.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter stating these four fundamental truths about the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUniverse and Man, the address turns to the people who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadopted the way of unbelief, and their attention is drawn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto a phenomenon which has persisted throughout human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory, namely that nation after nation has arisen and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tultimately gone to its doom. Man by his intellect and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason has been explaining this phenomenon in a thousand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tways, but Allah tells the real truth and declares that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fundamental causes of the destruction of the nations\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere only two.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst, that they refused to believe in the Messengers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom He sent for their guidance, with the result that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah too left them to themselves, and they invented\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir own philosophies of life and went on groping their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tway from one error to another.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSecond, that they also rejected the doctrine of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter, and thought this worldly life to be an end in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\titself, and that there was no life hereafter when they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould have to render an account of their deeds before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod. This corrupted their whole attitude towards life,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand their impure morals and character so polluted the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld that eventually the scourge of God itself had to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescend and eliminate them from the scene.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter stating these two instructive truths of human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory, the deniers of the message of Truth have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmonished to wake up and believe in Allah, His Messenger\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Light of Guidance that Allah has sent in the form\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Quran if they want to avoid the fate met by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformer peoples. Besides, they have been warned that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDay shall eventually come when all the former and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlatter generations will be collected at one place and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfraud and embezzlement committed by each will be exposed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore all mankind. Then the fate of each man will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecided finally on the basis as to who had adopted the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpath of the Faith and righteousness and who had followed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe way of disbelief and denial of the Truth. The first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgroup shall deserve eternal Paradise and the second shall\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe doomed to everlasting Hell. Then, addressing those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadopt the way of the Faith, a few important instructions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been given:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst, that whatever affliction befalls a person in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld, it befalls him by Allah's leave. Whoever in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate of affliction remains steadfast to the Faith, Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblesses his heart with guidance; otherwise although the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffliction of the one who in confusion or bewilderment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tturns away from the path of the Faith, cannot be averted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcept by Allah's leave, yet he becomes involved in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother, the greatest affliction of all, namely that his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theart is deprived of the guidance of Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSecondly, that the believer is not required to affirm the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaith with the tongue only, but after the affirmation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Faith he should practically obey Allah and His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger. If he turns away from obedience he would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself be responsible for his loss, for the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah (upon whom be His peace) has become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsolved from the responsibility after having delivered\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe message of Truth.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThirdly, that the believer should place his trust in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah alone and not in his own power or some other power\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the world.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFourthly, that the worldly goods and children are a great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrial and temptation for the believer, for it is their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlove which generally distracts man from the path of faith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand obedience. Therefore, the believers have to beware\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome of their children, and wives lest they become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trobbers for them on the Way of God directly or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindirectly; and they should spend their wealth for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsake of God so that their self remains safe against the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttemptations of Satan.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFifthly, that every man is responsible only to the extent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his power and ability. Allah does not demand that man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould exert himself beyond his power and ability.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, the believer should try his best to live in fear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof God as far as possible, and should see that he does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot transgress the bounds set by Allah in his speech,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconduct and dealings through his own negligence.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

For in the Divine Law provision for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivorce has been made only as an unavoidable necessity;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\totherwise Allah does not approve that the marriage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelationship that has been established between a man and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta woman should ever break. The Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace) has said \"Allah has not made lawful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything more hateful in His sight than divorce.\" (Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDaud).

This too is not a title of its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubject matter, but the name implies that it is the Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin which the incident of tahrim (prohibition,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforbiddance) has been mentioned.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Period of Revelation</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn connection with the incident of tahrim referred to in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah, the traditions of the Hadith mention two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tladies who were among the wives of the Holy Prophet (upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be peace) at that time: Hadrat Safiyyah and Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMariyah Qibtiyyah. The former (i.e. Hadrat Safiyyah) was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken to wife by the Holy Prophet after the conquest of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhaiber, and Khaiber was conquered, as has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunanimously reported, in A.H. 7. The other lady, Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMariyah, had been presented to the Holy Prophet by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuqawqis, the ruler of Egypt, in A. H. 7 and she had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tborne him his son, Ibrahim, in Dhil-Hijjah, A.H. 8.These\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistorical events almost precisely determine that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah was sent down some time during A.H. 7 or A.H 8.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Topics</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is a very important Surah in which light has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrown on some questions of grave significance with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treference to some incidents concerning the wives of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace). First, that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe powers to prescribe the bounds of the lawful and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunlawful, the permissible and the forbidden, are entirely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand absolutely in the hand of Allah and nothing has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdelegated even to the Prophet of Allah himself, not to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspeak of any other man. The Prophet as such can declare\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething lawful or unlawful only if he receives an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinspiration from Allah to do so whether that inspiration\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis embodied in the Quran, or imparted to him secretly.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, even the Prophet is not authorized to declare\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything made permissible by Allah unlawful by himself,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmuch less to say of another man.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSecond, that in any society the position of a Prophet is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvery delicate. A minor incident experienced by an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tordinary man in his life may not be of any consequence,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut it assumes the status of law when experienced by a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet. That is why the lives of the Prophets have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkept under close supervision by Allah so that none of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir acts, not even a most trivial one, may deviate from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDivine Will. Whenever such an act has emanated from a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, it was rectified and rectified immediately so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Islamic law and its principles should reach the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople in their absolute purity not only through the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDivine Book but also through the excellent example of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, and they should include nothing which may be in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisagreement with Divine Will.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThirdly, and this automatically follows from the above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned point, that when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) was checked on a minor thing, which was not only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorrected but also recorded, it gives us complete\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsatisfaction that whatever actions and commands and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstructions we now find in the pure life of the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet concerning which there is nothing on record in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe nature of criticism or correction from Allah, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare wholly based on truth, are in complete conformity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith Divine Will and we can draw guidance from them with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfull confidence and peace of mind.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe fourth thing that we learn from this discourse is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat about the Holy Messenger himself, whose reverence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand respect Allah Himself has enjoined as a necessary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpart of the Faith of His servants, it has been stated in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah that once during his sacred life he made a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthing declared lawful by Allah unlawful for himself only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto please his wives; then Allah has severely reproved for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir errors those very wives of the Holy Prophet, whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe Himself has declared as mothers of the faithful and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworthy of the highest esteem and honor by them. Then,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis criticism of the Prophet and the administration of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe warning to the wives also has not been made secretly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut included in the Book, which the entire umrah has to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tread and recite for ever. Obviously, neither the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintention of making mention of it in the Book of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas, nor it could be, that Allah wanted to degrade His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger and the mothers of the faithful in the eyes of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe believers; and this also is obvious that no Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas lost respect for them, in his heart after reading\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah of the Quran. Now, there cannot be any other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason of mentioning this thing in the Quran than that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah wants to acquaint the believers with the correct\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanner of reverence for their great personalities. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet is a Prophet, not God, that he may commit no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\terror. Respect of the Prophet has not been enjoined\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause he is infallible, but because he is a perfect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepresentative of Divine Will, and Allah has not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermitted any of his errors to pass by unnoticed. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgives us the satisfaction that the noble pattern of life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleft by the Prophet wholly and fully represents the will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah. Likewise, the Companions of the holy wives of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet, were human, not angels or supermen. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould commit mistakes. Whatever ranks they achieved\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecame possible only because the guidance given by Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the training imparted by Allah's Messenger had molded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem into the finest models. Whatever esteem and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treverence they deserve is on this very basis and not on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe presumption that they were infallible. For this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason, whenever in the sacred lifetime of the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon him be peace) the Companions or holy wives happened\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto commit an error due to human weakness, they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchecked. Some of their errors were corrected by the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, as has been mentioned at many places in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadith; some other errors were mentioned in the Quran and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah Himself corrected them so that the Muslims might\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot form any exaggerated notion of the respect and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treverence of their elders and great men, which might\\n\\t\\t\\t\\traise them from humanity to the position of gods and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoddesses. If one studies the Quran carefully, one will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsee instances of this one after the other. In Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Imran, in connection with the Battle of Uhud, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions have been addressed and told:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Allah did fulfill His promise (of help) to you: in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinitial stage of the battle, it was you who were killing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem by Allah's leave until you lost heart and disputed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout your duty and disobeyed your leader, when Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshowed you what (the spoils) you coveted for there were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong you some who hankered after the life of this world,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand others who cherished the life after death. Then Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaused your retreat before the disbelievers in order to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttest you, but the fact is that even then Allah pardoned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou, for Allah is very gracious to the believers.\" (v.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t152).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn surah An-Nur, in connection with the Slander against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Aisha, the Companions were told, \"When you heard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof it, why did not the believing men and the believing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen have a good opinion of themselves, and why did they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot say: this is a manifest slander?...Were it not for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's grace and mercy towards you in this world and in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hereafter, a painful scourge would have visited you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause of the slander. (Just consider) when you passed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis lie on from one tongue to the other and uttered with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour mouths that of which you had no knowledge. You took\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit as a trifling matter whereas it was a grave offence in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sight of Allah. Why did you not, as soon as you heard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof it, say 'It is not proper for us to utter such a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthing? Glory be to Allah! This is a great slander'.\"Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmonishes you that in future you should never repeat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything like this, if you are true believers.\" (vv.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t12-I7).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn surah Al-Ahzab, the holy wives have been addressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthus: \"O Prophet, say to your wives: If you seek the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld and its adornments, come, I shall give you of these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand send you off in a good way. But if you seek Allah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis Messenger and the abode of the Hereafter, you should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trest assured that Allah has prepared a great reward for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose of you, who do good.\" (vv. 28-29).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Surah Jumu'ah about the Companions it was said: \"And\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen they saw some merchandise and amusement they broke\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toff to it and left you (O Prophet) standing (in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcourse of the Sermon). Say to them : that which is with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah is far better than amusement and merchandise, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah is the best of all providers.\" (v. 11).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Surah Al-Mumtahinah, Hadrat Hatib bin Abi Balta'ah, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanion who had fought at Badr, was severely taken to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttask because he had sent secret information to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelieving Quraish about the Holy Prophet's invasion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the conquest of Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAll these instances are found in the Quran itself, in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame Quran in which Allah Himself has paid tribute to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions and the holy wives for their great merits, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgranted them the certificate of His good pleasure,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying: \"Allah became well pleased with them and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith Allah.\" It was this same moderate and balanced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteaching of the reverence and esteem of the great men,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich saved the Muslims from falling into the pit of man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworship in which the Jews and the Christians fell, and it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis a result of the same that in the books that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teminent followers of the sunnah have compiled on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubjects of the Hadith, Commentary of the Quran and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHistory, not only have the excellence and great merits of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Companions and holy wives and other illustrious men\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen mentioned, but also no hesitancies has been shown in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioning the incidents relating to their weaknesses,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\terrors and mistakes, whereas those scholars were more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappreciative of the merits and excellencies of the great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen and understood the bounds and limits of reverence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetter than those who claim to be the upholders of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treverence for the elders today.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe fifth thing that has been explicitly mentioned in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah is that Allah's Religion is absolutely fair\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand just. It has for every person just that of which he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecomes worthy on the basis of his faith and works. No\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelationship or connection even with the most righteous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson can be beneficial for him in any way and no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelationship or connection with the most evil and wicked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson can be harmful for him in any way. In this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconnection three kinds of women have been cited as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texamples before the holy wives in particular. One example\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis of the wives of the Prophets Noah and Lot, who, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey had believed and cooperated with their illustrious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thusbands, would have occupied the same rank and position\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the Muslim community which is enjoyed by the wives of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessings). But since they were disbelievers, their being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe wives of the Prophets did not help them and they fell\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto Hell. The second example is of the wife of Pharaoh,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho in spite of being the wife of a staunch enemy of God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieved and chose a path of action separate from that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowed by the Pharaoh's people, and her being the wife\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof a staunch disbeliever did not cause her any harm, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah made her worthy of Paradise. The third example is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Hadrat Maryam (Mary) (peace be upon her), who attained\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the high rank because she submitted to the severe test\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto which Allah had decided to put her. Apart from Mary no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother chaste and righteous girl in the world ever has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen put to such a hard test that in spite of being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunmarried, she might have been made pregnant miraculously\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Allah's command and informed what service her Lord\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twilled to take from her. When Hadrat Maryam accepted this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecision, and agreed to bear, like a true believer,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teverything that she inevitably had to bear in order to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfulfill Allah's will, then did Allah exalt her to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnoble rank of Sayyidatu an-nisa' fil-Jannah: \"Leader of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe women in Paradise\" (Musnad Ahmad).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBesides, another truth that we learn from this Surah is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceive from Allah only that knowledge which is included\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand recorded in the Quran, but he was given information\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout other things also by revelation, which has not been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecorded in the Quran. Its clear proof is verse 3 of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah. In it we are told that the Holy Prophet (upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace) confided a secret to one of his wives, and she\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttold it to another. Allah informed the Holy Prophet of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis secret. Then, when the Holy Prophet warned his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticular wife on the mistake of disclosure and she\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: \"Who has informed you of this mistake of mine?\" he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied: \"I have been informed of it by Him Who knows\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teverything and is All Aware.\" Now, the question is where\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the Quran is the verse in which Allah has said \"O\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, the secret that you had confided to one of your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twives, has been disclosed by her to another person, or to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso and so?\" If there is no such verse in the Quran, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobviously there is none, this is an express proof of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfact that revelation descended on the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbesides the Quran as well. This refutes the claim of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeniers of Hadith, who allege that nothing was sent down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) apart from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Hence, the right basis of morality is that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman should avoid evil, fearing the accountability of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunseen God, whether in the world there is a power to take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim to task for this or not, and whether in the world\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is a possibility of being harmed by such a power or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot. Those who adopt such a conduct in the world alone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill deserve forgiveness and a rich reward in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn vv. 15-23, making allusions, one after the other to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose common truths of daily occurrence, which man does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot regard as worthy of much attention, he has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvited to consider them seriously. It has been said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Look: the earth on which you move about with full\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsatisfaction and peace of mind, and from which you obtain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour sustenance has been subdued for you by Allah;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\totherwise this earth might at any time start shaking\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuddenly so as to cause your destruction, or a typhoon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmight occur, which may annihilate you completely. Look at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe birds that fly above you; it is only Allah Who is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsustaining them in the air. Look at your own means and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresources: if Allah wills to inflict you with a scourge,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnone can save you from it; and if Allah wills to close\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe doors of sustenance on you, none can open them for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou. These things are there to make you aware of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruth, but you see them like animals, which are unable to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdraw conclusions from observations, and you do not use\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour sight, hearing and minds which Allah has bestowed on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou as men; that is why you do not see the right way.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn vv. 24-27, it has been said: \"You have ultimately to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappear before your God in any case.

Consequently, they were deprived of the blessing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand they realized this, when all they had lay devastated.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWith this parable the people of Makkah have been warned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the effect: \"With the appointment of the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) to Prophethood, you, O people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah, too, have been put to a test similar to the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto which the owners of the garden had been put. If you do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot listen to him, you too will be afflicted with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunishment in the world, and the punishment of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter is far greater.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, in vv. 34-47 continuously, the disbelievers have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen admonished, in which the address sometimes turns to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem directly and sometimes they are warned through the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace). A summary of what has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen said in this regard, is this: Well being in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter inevitably belongs to those who spend their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlives in the world in full consciousness of God. It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tutterly against reason that the obedient servants should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeet in the Hereafter the same fate as the guilty. There\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis absolutely no basis of the disbelievers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmisunderstanding that God will treat them in the manner\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey choose for themselves, whereas they have no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguarantee for this. Those who are being called upon to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbow before God in the world and they refuse to do so,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be unable to prostrate themselves on the Day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tResurrection even if they wanted to do so, and thus would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstand disgraced and condemned. Having denied the Quran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey cannot escape Divine punishment. The rein they are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing given, has deluded them. They think that since they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare not being punished in spite of their denial, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmust be on the right path, whereas they are following the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpath of ruin. They have no reasonable ground for opposing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Messenger, for he is a preacher without any vested\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterest: he is not asking any reward of them for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself, and they cannot either make the claim that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknow with certainty that he is not a true Messenger, nor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat what he says is false.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen exhorted to the effect: \"Bear with patience the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thardships that you may have to face in the way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreaching the Faith till Allah's judgment arrives, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tavoid the impatience which caused suffering and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffliction to the Prophet Jonah (peace be on him).\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

On\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thearing this Islam entered deep into my heart.\" This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttradition of Hadrat Umar shows that this surah had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsent down long before his acceptance of Islam, for even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter this event he did not believe for a long time, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the continued to be influenced in favor of Islam by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifferent incidents from time to time, till at last in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe house of his own sister he came by the experience\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat made him surrender and submit to the Faith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompletely.

On the way be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tled the Fajr Prayer at Nakhlah. At that time a company of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe jinn happened to pass that way. When they heard the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran being recited, they tarried and listened to it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattentively. This very event has been described in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMost of the commentators, on the basis of this tradition,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve that this relates to the Holy Prophet's well\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknown journey to Taif, which had taken place three years\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the Hijrah in the 10th year of the Prophethood.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut this is not correct for several reasons. The jinn's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thearing the Quran during the journey to Taif has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated in Al-Ahqaf 29-32. A cursory reading of those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverses shows that the jinn who had believed after hearing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran on that occasion were already believers in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Moses and the previous scriptures. On the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontrary, vv. 2-7 of this surah clearly show that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjinn who heard the Quran on this occasion were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpolytheists and deniers of the Hereafter and Prophethood.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, it is confirmed historically that in his journey to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTaif none accompanied the Holy Prophet except Hadrat Zaid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Harithah. On the contrary, concerning this journey\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Abbas says that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas accompanied by some of his Companions. Furthermore,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe traditions also agree that in that journey the jinn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theard the Quran when the Holy Prophet had stopped at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNakhlah on his return journey from Taif to Makkah, and in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis journey, according to the traditions of Ibn Abbas,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe event of the jinn's hearing the Quran occurred when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet was going to Ukaz from Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, in view of these reasons what seems to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorrect is that in Surah Al-Ahqaf and Surah Al Jinn, one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the same event has not been narrated, but these were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo separate events, which took place during two separate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjourneys.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs far as Surah Al-Ahqaf is concerned, it is agreed that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe event mentioned in it occurred on the return journey\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Taif in the 10th year of Prophethood. As for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestion, when this second event took place, its answer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis not given by the tradition of Ibn Abbas, nor any other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistorical tradition shows as to when the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad gone to the Fair of Ukaz along with some of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions. However, a little consideration of vv 8-10 of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis surah shows that this could only be an event of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearliest stage of Prophethood. In these verses it has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen stated that before the appointment of the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (upon whom be peace) to Divine Mission the jinn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tused to have one or another opportunity to eavesdrop in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe heavens in order to hear news of the unseen, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter it they suddenly found that angels had been set as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguards and meteorites were being shot on every side so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they could find no place of safety from where they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould hear the secret news. Thereupon they had set about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsearching for the unusual thing that had occurred on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearth, or was going to occur, because of which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecurity measures had been tightened up. Probably since\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen many companies of the jinn must have been moving\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout in search of the unusual occurrence and one of them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter having heard the Quran from the Holy Prophet (upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be peace) must have formed the opinion that that was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe very thing for the sake of which all the gates of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theavens had been shut against the jinn.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Reality of Jinn</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBefore one starts the study of this Surah one must\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclearly know what is the reality of the jinn so as to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tavoid any possible mental confusion. Many people of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmodern times are involved in the misunderstanding that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe jinn are not real, but only a figment of the ancient\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuperstition and myths. They have not formed this opinion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the basis that they have known all the realities and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruths about the universe and have thus discovered that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe jinn do not exist. They cannot claim to possess any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch knowledge either. But they have assumed without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason and proof that nothing exists in the universe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcept what they can see, whereas the sphere of human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperceptions as against the vastness of this great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuniverse is not even comparable to a drop of water as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst the ocean. Here, the person who thinks that what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the does not perceive, does not exist, and what exists\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmust necessarily be perceived, in fact, provides a proof\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the narrowness of his own mind. With this mode of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthought, not to speak of the jinn, man cannot even accept\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand acknowledge any reality, which he cannot directly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texperience and observe, and he cannot even admit the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texistence of God, to say nothing of admitting any other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunseen reality.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThose of the Muslims who have been influenced by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmodernism, but cannot deny the Quran either, have given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrange interpretations of the clear statements of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran about the jinn, Iblis and Satan. They say that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes not refer to any hidden creation, which may have its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\town independent existence, but it sometimes implies man's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\town animal forces, which have been called Satan, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsometimes it implies savage and wild mountain tribes, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsometimes the people who used to listen to the Quran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecretly. But the statements of the Quran in this regard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare so clear and explicit that these interpretations bear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno relevance to them whatever.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Quran frequently mentions the jinn and the men in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanner as to indicate that they are two separate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreations. For this, see Al Araf: 38, Hind : 119, Ha Mim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs-Sajdah: 25,29, Ahqaf: 18, Adh Dhariyat: 56, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentire surah Ar-Rahman, which bears such clear evidence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas to leave no room to regard the jinn as a human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecies.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Surah Al-Araf: 12, Al Hijr : 26-27 and Ar-Rahman :\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t14-19, it has been expressly stated that man was created\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout of clay and jinn out of fire.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Surah Al Hijr: 27, it has been said that the jinn had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen created before man. The same thing is testified by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe story of Adam and Iblis, which has been told at seven\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifferent places in the Quran, and at every place it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfirms that Iblis was already there at the creation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman. Moreover, in surah Al-Kahf: 50, it has been stated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Iblis belonged to the jinn.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn surah Al-Araf: 27, it has been stated in clear words\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the jinn see the human beings but the human beings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo not see them.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn surah Al-Hijr: 16-l8, surah As-Saaffat: 6-10 and surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Mulk: 5, it has been said that although the jinn can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tascend to the heavens, they cannot exceed a certain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlimit; if they try to ascend beyond that limit and try to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thear what goes on in the heavens, they are not allowed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo so, and if they try to eavesdrop they are driven away\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby meteorites. By this the belief of the polytheistic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabs that the jinn possess the knowledge of the unseen,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor have access to Divine secrets, has been refuted. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame error has also been refuted in Saba: 14.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Baqarah: 30-34 and Al-Kahf: 50 show that Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentrusted man with the vicegerency of the earth and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen are superior to the jinn. Although the jinn also have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen given certain extraordinary powers and abilities an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texample of which is found in An-Naml 39, yet the animals\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlikewise have been given some powers greater than man,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut these are no argument that the animals are superior\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto man.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Quran also explains that the jinn, like men, are a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreation possessed of power and authority, and they, just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike them, can choose between obedience and disobedience,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaith and disbelief. This is confirmed by the story of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSatan and the event of the jinn affirming the faith as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfound in Surahs Al-Ahqaf and Al-Jinn.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt scores of places in the Quran, it has also been stated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Iblis at the very creation of Adam had resolved to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmisguide mankind, and since then the Satanic jinn have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen persistently trying to mislead man, but they do not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave the power to overwhelm him and make him do something\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforcibly. However, they inspire him with evil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuggestions, beguile him and make evil seem good to him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor this, see An-Nisa 117-120, Al-Araf: 11-17, Ibrahim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t22, Al-Hijr 30-42, An-Nahl 98-100, Bani Israel 61-65.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Quran also tells us that in the pre-Islamic ignorance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe polytheistic Arabs regarded the jinn as associates of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod, worshipped them and thought they were descended from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod. For this, see A1-An'am: 100, Saba: 40-41, Assaffat:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t158.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFrom these details, it becomes abundantly clear that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjinn have their own objective existence and are a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcealed creation of an entirely different species from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman. Because of their mysterious qualities, ignorant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople have formed exaggerated notions and concepts about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem and their powers, and have even worshipped them, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran has explained the whole truth about them, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshows what they are and what they are not.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Topics</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this Surah in vv. 1-15, it has been told what was the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timpact of the Quran on the company of the jinn when they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theard it and what they said to their fellow jinn when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey returned to them. Allah, in this connection, has not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcited their whole conversation but only those particular\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthings which were worthy of mention. That is why the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstyle is not that of a continuous speech but sentences\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been cited so as to indicate that they said this and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis. If one studies these sentences spoken by the jinn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcarefully, one can easily understand the real object of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe narration of this event of their affirming the faith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand or mentioning this conversation of theirs with their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople in the Quran.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, in vv. 16-18, the people have been admonished\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the effect: \"If you refrain from polytheism and follow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe way of righteousness firmly, you will be blessed;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\totherwise if you turn away from the admonition sent down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Allah, you will meet with a severe punishment.\" Then,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin vv. 19-23, the disbelievers of Makkah have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treproached, as if to say: When the Messenger of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcalls you towards Allah, you surround and mob him from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery side, whereas the only duty of the Messenger is to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconvey the messages of Allah. He does not claim to have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany power to bring any gain or cause any harm to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople.\" Then, in vv. 24-25 the disbelievers have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twarned to the effect: \"Today you are trying to overpower\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand suppress the Messenger seeing that he is helpless and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfriendless, but a time will come when you will know who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin actual fact is helpless and friendless. Whether that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime is yet far off, or near at hand, the Messenger has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno knowledge thereof, but it will come to pass in any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcase.\" In conclusion, the people have been told: The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKnower of the unseen is Allah alone. The Messenger\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceives only that knowledge which Allah is pleased to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgive him. This knowledge pertains to matters connected\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the performance of the duties of Prophethood and it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis delivered to him in such security which does not admit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof any external interference whatever.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

As for the question, in which specific period of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe life at Makkah it was revealed, it is not answered by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe tradition, but the internal evidence of the subject\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter of this section helps to determine the period of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits revelation.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst, in it the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen instructed to the effect: \"Arise during the night\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand worship Allah so that you may develop the capability\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto shoulder the heavy burden of Prophethood and to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdischarge its responsibilities.\" This shows that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCommand must have been given in the earliest period of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophethood when training was being imparted to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly prophet by Allah for this office.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSecondly, a Command has been given in it that the Quran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe recited in the Tahajjud Prayer for half the night, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthereabouts.

This shows\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat this section was revealed at a time when the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (upon whom be peace) had openly started preaching\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam and the opposition to him at Makkah had grown\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactive and strong.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbout the second section (v. 20) although many of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentators have expressed the opinion that this too was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsent down at Makkah, yet some other commentators regard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit as a Madani Revelation, and this same opinion is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfirmed by the subject matter of this section. For it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentions fighting in the way of Allah, and obviously,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere could be no question of it at Makkah; it also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontains the Command to pay the obligatory zakat, and it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis fully confirmed that the zakat at a specific rate and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith an exemption limit (nisab) was enjoined at Madinah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the first seven verses the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) has been commanded to the effect: \"Prepare\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyourself to shoulder the responsibilities of the great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMission that has been entrusted to you; its practical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tform is that you should rise during the hours of night\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand stand up in Prayer for half the night, or for a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlittle more or less of it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn vv. 8-14, he has been exhorted to the effect: \"Devote\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyourself exclusively to that God Who is the Owner of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole universe, entrust all your affairs to Him with full\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsatisfaction of the heart. Bear with patience whatever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour opponents may utter against you. Do not be intimate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith them. Leave their affair to God: He Himself will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeal with them.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, in vv. 15-19, those of the people of Makkah, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere opposing the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen warned, so as to say: \"We have sent a Messenger to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou just as We sent a Messenger to the Pharaoh.

The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecond section, according to a tradition from Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSa'id bin Jubair, was sent down ten years later, and in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit the initial Command given in connection with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTahajjud Prayer, in the beginning of the first section,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas curtailed.

Even according to some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditions which have been related in Bukhari, Muslim,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad, etc., on the authority of Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJabir bin Abdullah, these are the very earliest verses of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran to be revealed to the Holy Prophet (upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace). But the Muslim Ummah almost unanimously agreed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the earliest Revelation to the Holy Prophet (upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be peace) consisted of the first five verses of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Al-Alaq (XCVI) However, what is established by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthentic traditions is that after this first Revelation,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno Revelation came down to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) for quite some time. Then, when it was resumed, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstarted with theme verses of Surah Al-Muddaththir. Imam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZuhri has given the following details of it:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Revelation to the Holy Prophet remained suspended for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquite some time, and it was such a period of deep grief\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand distress for him that he started going early to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttops of the mountains to throw himself down from them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut whenever he stood on the edge of a peak, the Angel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGabriel would appear and tell him that he was Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet. This would console him and restore to him full\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace of mind.\" (Ibn Jarir). After this Imam Zuhri\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelates the following tradition on the authority of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Jabir bin Abdullah; \"The Holy Messenger of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescribing the period of falrat al-wahi (break in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation) said: One day when I was passing on the way,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI suddenly heard a call from heaven. I raised my head and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaw that the same Angel who had visited me in the Cave of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHira was sitting on a throne between heaven and earth.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis struck terror in my heart, and reaching home\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquickly, I said: 'Cover me up, cover me up'. So the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of the house covered me up with a quilt (or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblanket). At that time Allah sent down the Revelation: Ya\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tayyuhal-Muddaththiru...

This has been fully well described\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the Surah by Ibn Hishan and we shall cite it below.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject. Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs has been explained above, the earliest Revelation to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) consisted of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst five verses of Surah Al-Alaq, in which it had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSaid: \"Read (O Prophet), in the name of your Lord, Who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreated: created man from a clot of congealed blood.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRead: and your Lord is Most Generous, Who taught\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknowledge by the pen, taught man what he did not know.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis was the first experience of Revelation met with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuddenly by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace). in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis message it was not told what great mission he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen entrusted with and what duties he had to perform in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfuture. He was only initiated into it and then left alone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor a time so that the great strain this experience had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaused should pass away and he should mentally become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprepared to receive the Revelation and perform the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprophetic mission in the future. After this intermission\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen Revelation Was resumed, the first seven verses of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah were revealed: In these he Was for the first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime commanded to arise and warn the people of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequences of the way of life they were following and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto proclaim the greatness of God in the world where\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers were being magnified without any right. Along with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he was given this instruction: The demand of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUnique mission that you have to perform, now is that your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife should be pure in every respect and you should carry\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout the duty of reforming your people sincerely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tirrespective of any worldly gain. Then, in the last\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsentence, he was exhorted to endure with patience, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sake of his Lord, all the hardships and troubles that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the might have to face while performing his mission.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the implementation of this Divine Command when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Messenger of Allah began to preach Islam and recite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quranic Surahs revealed successively, the people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah felt alarmed, and it provoked a great storm of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topposition and hostility. A few months passed in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate until the Hajj season approached. The people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah feared that if Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) started visiting the caravans of the pilgrims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcoming from all over Arabia at their halting places and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treciting the spellbinding and unique Revelations of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran in their assemblies on the occasion of Hajj, his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage would reach every part of Arabia and influence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountless people. Therefore, the Quraish chiefs held a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconference and settled that they would start a propaganda\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcampaign against the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the pilgrims as soon as they arrived. After they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad agreed on this, Walid bin al-Mughirah said to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassembled people: \"If you said contradictory things about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings), we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall would lose our trust among the people. Therefore, let\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tus agree upon one opinion, which we should all say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout dispute. Some people said that they would call\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsoothsayer. Walid said: No, by God, be is not a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsoothsayer. We have seen the soothsayers: what they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmurmur and what they utter has no remote resemblance with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran. Some other people said: Then we say be is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossessed. Walid said: He is not a possessed one: we have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseen bad and insane people; the way one talks\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisjointedly and behaves foolishly in that state is known\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto all: who would believe that what Muhammad (upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace) presented was the incoherent speech of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmadman? The people said: Then we say he is a poet. Walid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: No, he is not a poet, for we know poetry in all its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforms, and what he presents conforms to no form of it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe people said: Then he is a sorcerer. Walid said: He is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno sorcerer either: we have seen sorcerers and we also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknow what methods they adopt for their sorcery. This also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes not apply to Muhammad. Then he said: \"Whichever of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese things you said about Muhammad, it would be known\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto be a false accusation. By God, his speech is sweet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this root is deep and his branches are fruitful. At this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Jahl, urging on Walid, said: Your people will never\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe pleased with you unless you say something about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad. He said: Let me think over it awhile. Then,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter prolonged thought and consideration, he said: The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnearest thing to the truth is that you tell the Arabs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he is a sorcerer, who has brought a message by which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the separates a man from his father; and from his brother,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand from his wife and children, and from his family. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall agreed on what Walid had proposed. Then, according to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta scheme the men of Quraish spread among the pilgrims in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hajj season and they warned everyone they met of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsorcery of Muhammad (upon whom be peace) and of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstirring up divisions in the families by it.\" But the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresult was that by their this plan the Quraish chiefs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves made the name of the Holy Messenger known\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthroughout Arabia. (Ibn Hisham, pp. 288-289. That Walid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad made this proposal on the insistence of Abu Jahl has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen related by Ibn Jarir in his Tafsir on the authority\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Ikrimah).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, it has been explicitly stated: Allah does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot stand in need of anybody's faith that He may fulfill\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this conditions. The Quran is an admonition that has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresented before the people openly; now whoever wills may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept it. Allah has a right that the people should fear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis disobedience and He alone has the power to forgive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe one who adopts piety and an attitude of God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsciousness even though one may have committed many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacts of disobedience in the past.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

After\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse 15 the discourse is suddenly interrupted and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace) told: \"Do not move your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttongue to remember this Revelation hastily.

This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin fact happened at the time when the coming down and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceipt of Revelation was yet a new experience for him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand he was not yet fully used to receiving it calmly.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere are two other instances also of this in the Quran.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst, in Surah Ta Ha the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) has been told: \"And see that you do not hasten to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecite the Quran belore its revelation is completed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou.\" (v. 114). Then, in Surah Al-A'la, it has been said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"We shall enable you to recite:, then you shall never\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforget.\" (v. 6). Later, when the Holy Prophet became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfully used to receiving the Revelation well, there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremained no need to give him any such instruction. That\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis why except for these three, there is no other instance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof this in the Quran.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMost of the Surahs, from here till the end of the Quran,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin view of their content and style, seem to have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsent down in the period when after the first seven verses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Surah Al-Muddaththir, revelation of the Quran began\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike a shower of rain: Thus, in the successively revealed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs Islam and its fundamental concepts and moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteachings were presented so forcefully and effectively in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpithy, brief sentences and the people of Makkah warned so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvehemently on their errors and deviations that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish chiefs were utterly confounded. Therefore, before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe next Hajj season came they held the conference for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdevising schemes to defeat the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) as has been mentioned in the Introduction to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Al-Muddaththir above.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this Surah, addressing the deniers of the Hereafter,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplies have been given to each of their doubts and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobjections, strong arguments have been given to prove the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossibility, occurrence and necessity of the Resurrection\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Hereafter, and also it has been pointed out clearly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the actual reason of the people's denying the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter is not that they regard it as impossible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trationally but because their selfish motives do not allow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem to affirm it. At the same time, the people have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twarned, as if to say: \"The event, the occurrence of which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou deny, will inevitably come: all your deeds will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrought and placed before you. As a matter of fact, even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore any of you sees his record, he will be knowing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfully well what he has done in the world, for no man is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunaware of himself, no matter what excuses and pretenses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the may offer to deceive the world and deceive himself in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trespect of his misdeeds.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

However, some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentators hold the view that the Surah was revealed at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah, and some others say that it was revealed at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah but vv. 8-10 of it were sent down at Madinah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs far as the subject matter and the style of the Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare concerned, these are very different from those of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadani Surahs. A little study of it rather shown that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis not only a Makki Surah but it was revealed during the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearliest period at Makkah, which began just after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation of the first seven verses of Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Muddaththir. As for vv. 8-10, they are so naturally\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tset in the theme of the Surah that if they are read in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir proper context, no one can say that the theme\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreceding and following them had been sent down 15 to 16\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyears earlier but these three verses which were revealed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmany years later were inserted here unnaturally.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn fact, the basis of the idea that this Surah; or some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverses of it were revealed at Madinah, is a tradition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich Ata has related from Ibn Abbas (may Allah bless\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim). He says that once Hadrat Hasan and Husain fell ill.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Holy Prophet and some of his Companions visited them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey wished Hadrat Ali to make a vow to Allah for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecovery of the two children. Thereupon, Hadrat All,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Fatimah and Fiddah their maid servant, vowed a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfast of three days if Allah restored the children to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thealth. The children recovered by the grace of Allah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe three of them began to fast as avowed. As there was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnothing to eat in the house, Hadrat Ali borrowed three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeasures (sa') of barley from somebody (according to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother tradition, earned through labor). When on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst day they sat down to eat after breaking the fast, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoor man came and begged for food. They gave all their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfood to him, drank water and retired to bed. The next day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen they again sat down to eat after breaking the fast,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan orphan came and begged for something. They again gave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taway the whole food to him, drank water and went to bed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the third day when they were just going to eat after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreaking the fast, a captive came up and begged for food\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlikewise. Again the whole food was given away to him. On\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fourth day Hadrat Ali took both the children with him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand went before the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Holy Prophet (on whom be peace) seeing the weak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition of the three, returned with them to the house\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Hadrat Fatimah and found her lying in a corner half\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdead with hunger. This moved him visibly. In the meantime\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Angel Gabriel (peace be on him) came and said; \"Look,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah has congratulated you on the virtues of the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof your house!\" When the Holy Prophet asked what it was,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the recited this whole Surah in response. (According to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Mahran's tradition, he recited it from verse 5 till\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe end. But the tradition which Ibn Marduyah has related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Ibn Abbas only says that the verse Wff yut'imun-at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tta'am...was sent down concerning Hadrat Ali and Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFatimah; there is no mention of this story in it). This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole story has been narrated by Ali bin Ahmad al-Wahidi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin his Commentary of the Quran, entitled Al'Basit, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprobably from the same it has been taken by Zamakhshari,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRazi, Nisaburi and others.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the first place, this tradition is very weak as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregards its chain of transmission. Then, from the point\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof view of its subject matter also, it is strange that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen a poor man, or an orphan, or a captive, comes to beg\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor food, he is given all the food. He could be given one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmember's food and the five of them could share the rest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof it among themselves. Then this also is incredible that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tillustrious persons like Hadrat Ali and Hadrat Fatimah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho possessed perfect knowledge of Islam, should have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregarded it as an act of virtue to keep the two children,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho had just recovered their health and were still weak,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thungry for three consecutive days. Moreover, in respect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the captives also, it has never been a practice under\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Islamic government that they should be left to beg\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor food for themselves. For if they were prisoners of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe government, the government itself was responsible to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarrange food and clothing for them, and if they were in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan individual's custody, he was made responsible to feed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand clothe them. Therefore, it was not possible that in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah a captive should have gone about begging food\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom door to door. However, overlooking the weaknesses of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttransmission and the probability of subject matter, even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif the narrative is accepted as it goes, at the most what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit shows is that when the people of the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thouse acted righteously as they did, Gabriel came and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgave him the good news that Allah had much appreciated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir act of virtue, for they had acted precisely in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trighteous way that Allah had commanded in these verses of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Ad-Dahr. This does not necessitate that these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverses too were sent down on that very occasion. The same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the case with many traditions concerning the occasion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof revelation. When about a certain verse it is said that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit was sent down on a particular occasion, it in fact\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes not mean that the verse was sent down on the very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccasion the incident took place. But it means that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse applies precisely and exactly to the incident. Imam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSuyuti in Al-Itqan has quoted this from Hafiz Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTaimiyyah: \"When the reporters say that a verse was sent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown concerning a particular incident, it sometimes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timplies that the same incident (or matter) occasioned its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation, and sometimes that the verse applies to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter although it may not have occasioned its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation.\"Further on he quotes Imam Badr ad-Din\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZarkashi's view from his Al-Burhan fi Ulum al-Quran:\"It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis well known in respect of the Companions and their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timmediate successors that when one of them says that a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse was sent down concerning a particular matter, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeans that the ruling contained in it applied to that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter and not that the matter itself occasioned the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation of the verse. Thus, it only uses the ruling of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe verse for the purpose of reasoning and not for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstating a fact.\" (Al- Itqan fi Ulum al-Quran, vol. I, p.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t31, Ed. 1929).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe theme of this Surah is to inform man of his true\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tposition in the world and to tell him that if he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstood his true position rightly and adopted the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattitude of gratefulness, he would meet with such and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch good end, and if he adopted the way of disbelief, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould meet with such and such evil ends. In the longer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs of the Quran this same theme has been presented at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlength, but a special characteristic of the style of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearliest Surahs revealed at Makkah is that the subjects\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdealt with at length in the later period, \"have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresented in a brief but highly effective way in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod in such concise, elegant sentences as may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tautomatically be preserved in the memory of the hearers.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this Surah, first of all man has been reminded that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere was a time when he was nothing; then a humble\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeginning of him was made with a mixed drop of sperm and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tovum of which even his mother was not aware; even she did\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot know that he had been conceived nor anyone else\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseeing the microscopic cell could say that it was a man,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho in future would become the best of creation on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearth. After this, man has been warned, so as to say:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Beginning your creation in this way We have developed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand shaped you into what you are today in order to test\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand try you in the world. That is why, unlike other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreatures, you were made intelligent and sensible and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere shown both the way of gratitude and the way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tingratitude clearly so that you may show, in the interval\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat you have been granted here for work, whether you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave emerged as a grateful servant from the test or an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunbelieving, ungrateful wretch!\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, just in one sentence, it has been stated decisively\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat will be the fate to be met with in the Hereafter by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who emerged as unbelievers from this test.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, in vv. 5-22 continuously, the blessings with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich those who do full justice to servitude in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld, will be favored, have been mentioned in full\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetail. In these verses, not only have their best rewards\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen mentioned but they have also been told briefly what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare the acts on the basis of which they would become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworthy of those rewards. Another special characteristic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the earliest Surahs revealed at Makkah is that besides\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintroducing in them briefly the fundamental beliefs and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcepts of Islam, here and there, those moral qualities\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand virtuous acts have been mentioned, which are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpraiseworthy according to Islam, and also those evils of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeed and morality of which Islam strives to cleanse human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife. And these two things have not been mentioned with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tview to show what good or evil result is entailed by them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the transitory life of the world, but they have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned only to point out what enduring results they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill produce in the eternal and everlasting life of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter, irrespective of whether an evil quality may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprove useful or a good quality may prove harmful in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is the subject matter of the first section (vv.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t1-22). In the second section, addressing the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace), three things have been stated:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst, that \"it is in fact We Ourself Who are revealing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Quran piecemeal to you, and this is intended to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinform the disbelievers, not you, that the Quran is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing fabricated by Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand blessings) but it is \"We Who are revealing it, and it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis Our Own wisdom which requires that We should reveal it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpiece by piece and not all at once.\" Second, the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet has been told: \"No matter how long it may take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the decree of your Lord to be enforced and no matter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat afflictions may befall you in the meantime, in any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcase you should continue to perform your mission of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tApostleship patiently, and not to yield to the pressure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttactics of any of these wicked and unbelieving people.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe third thing he has been told is: \"Remember Allah day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand night, perform the Prayer and spend your nights in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe worship of Allah, for it is these things which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsustain and strengthen those who call to Allah in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tface of iniquity and disbelief.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen in one single sentence, the actual cause of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers' wrong attitude has been stated: they have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforgotten the Hereafter and are enamored of the world. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe second sentence, they have been warned to the effect:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"You have not come into being by yourself: We have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreated you. You have not made these broad chests, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrong, sturdy hands and feet for yourselves, it is We\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWho made these for you; and it so lies in Our power to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreat you as We please. We can distort your figures, We\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcan destroy you and replace you by some other nation. We\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcan cause you to die and can recreate you in whatever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tform we like.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, it has been said: This is an Admonition:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhoever wills may accept it and take a path to his Lord.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut man's own will and desire is not everything in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld. No one's will and desire can be fulfilled unless\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah (also) so wills. And Allah's willing is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thaphazard: whatever He wills, He wills it on the basis of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis knowledge and wisdom. He admits into His mercy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhomever He regards as worthy of His mercy on the basis\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof His knowledge and wisdom, and He has prepared a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpainful torment for those whom He finds unjust and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twicked.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

The reasoning is that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpower of All-Mighty Allah Who established this wonderful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsystem on the earth, cannot be helpless in bringing about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Resurrection, and the express wisdom which underlies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis system bears full evidence that the Hereafter must\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappear, for no act of an All-Wise Creator can be vain and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurposeless, and if there was no Hereafter, it would mean\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the whole of one's life was useless and absurd.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe people of Makkah repeatedly asked, \"Bring about the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tResurrection with which you threaten us; only then shall\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twe believe in it.\" In vv. 8-15, their demand has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanswered, saying: \"Resurrection is no sport or fun so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat whenever a jester should ask for it, it should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrought forth immediately. It is indeed the Day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJudgment to settle the account of all mankind and of all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits individuals. For it Allah has fixed a specific time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit will take place at its own time, and when it takes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplace with all its dreads and horrors, it will confound\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who are demanding it for fun today. Then their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcases will be decided only on the evidence of those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessengers whom these deniers of the truth are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepudiating with impunity. Then they will themselves\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealize how they themselves are responsible for their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdooms.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn vv. 16-28 arguments have been given continuously for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe occurrence and necessity of the Resurrection and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter. In these it has been stated that man's own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory, his own birth, and the structure of the earth on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich he lives, bear the testimony that the coming of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tResurrection and the establishment of the Hereafter are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible as well as the demand of Allah Almighty's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twisdom. History tells us that the nations which denied\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hereafter ultimately became corrupted and met with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestruction. This means that the Hereafter is a truth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich if denied and contradicted by a nation by its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconduct and attitude, will cause it to meet the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoom, which is met by a blind man who rushes headlong\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto an approaching train. And it also means that in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkingdom of the universe only physical laws are not at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twork but a moral law also is working in it, under which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin this very world the process of retribution is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toperating. But since in the present life of the world\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tretribution is not taking place in its complete and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperfect form, the moral law of the universe necessarily\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemands that there should come a time when it should take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits full course and all those good works and evil deeds,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich could not be rewarded here, or which escaped their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdue punishment should be fully rewarded and punished. For\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis it is inevitable that there should be a second life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter death. If man only considers how he takes his birth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the world, his intellect, provided it is sound\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintellect, cannot deny that for the God Who began his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreation from an insignificant sperm drop and developed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim into a perfect man, it certainly possible to create\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same man once again. After death the particles of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman's body do not disappear but continue to exist on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame earth on which he lived his whole life. It is from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe resources and treasures of this very earth that he is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade and nourished and then into the same treasures of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe earth he is deposited. The God who caused him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temerge from the treasures of the earth, in the first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance, can also cause him to re-emerge from the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreasures after he has been restored to them at death. If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone only considers the powers of Allah, one cannot deny\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat He can do this; and if one considers the wisdom of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, one also cannot deny that it is certainly the very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemand of His wisdom to call man to account for the right\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand wrong use of the powers that He has granted him on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe earth; it would rather be against wisdom to let him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toff without rendering an account.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, in vv. 28-40, the fate of the deniers of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter has been depicted, and in vv. 41-45 of those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho affirming faith in it in their worldly life,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tendeavored to improve their Hereafter, and abstained from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe evils of disbelief and thought, morality and deed,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconduct and character which might be helpful in man's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworldly life, but are certainly ruinous for his life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thereafter.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the end, the deniers of the Hereafter and those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tturn away from God-worship, have been warned as if to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay: \"Enjoy your short-lived worldly pleasure as you may,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut your end will ultimately be disastrous.\" The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscourse concludes with the assertion that the one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfails to obtain guidance from a Book like the Quran, can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave no ether source in the world to afford him Guidance.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

They believed in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis Being the Supreme Sustainer, Creator and Providence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand also admitted that all those beings whom they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregarded as their deities, were themselves Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreatures. Therefore, in this regard the only thing they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisputed was whether they had any share in the attributes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand powers of Divinity and in the Divine Being itself or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs for the second thing, the people of Makkah were not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprepared to accept it. However, what they could not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossibly deny was that during the 40 years life that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace) had lived among them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore his claim to Prophethood, they had never found him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta lying deceitful person or the one who would adopt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunlawful methods for selfish ends. They themselves\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmitted that he was a man possessed of wisdom,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trighteousness and moral superiority. Therefore, in spite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof charging him with a thousand false accusations, to say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnothing of making others believe, they were finding it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifficult even for themselves to believe that although he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas an honest and upright man in every other affair and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdealing of life, yet, God forbid, a liar only in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclaim to be a Prophet.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThus, the first two things were not in fact so perplexing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the people of Makkah as the third thing. When this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas presented before them, they mocked it most of all,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpressed unusual wonder at it, and regarding it as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremote from reason and impossible, started talking\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst it as incredible, even inconceivable, in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassemblies. But in order to bring them to the way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam it was absolutely essential that the doctrine of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hereafter should be instilled into their minds, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout belief in this doctrine, it was not at all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible that they could adopt a serious attitude with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregard to the truth and falsehood, could change their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstandard of values in respect of good and evil, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiving up worship of the world, could be inclined to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollow the way that Islam urged them to follow. That is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhy in the earliest Surahs revealed at Makkah the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoctrine of the Hereafter has been impressed and stressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore than anything else. However, the arguments for it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been given in such a way that the doctrine of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOneness of God (Tauhid) also is impressed on the minds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tautomatically. This also contains brief arguments, here\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand there, to confirm the truth of the Holy Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah and the Quran.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter understanding well why the theme of the Hereafter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been so frequently repeated in the Surahs of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod, let us now have a look at the subject matter of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah. In it first of all, allusion has been made to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe common talk and the doubts that were being expressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin every street of Makkah and in every assembly of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of Makkah on hearing the news about Resurrection.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, the deniers have been asked: \"Don't you see this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearth which We have spread as a carpet for you? Don't you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsee the high mountains which we have so firmly placed in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe earth? Don't you consider your own selves how We have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreated you as pairs of men and women? Don't you consider\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour sleep by which We make you seek a few hours rest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter every few hours labor and toil so as to keep you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfit for work in the world? Don't you see the alternation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the night and day which We are so regularly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperpetuating precisely according to your needs and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trequirements? Don't you see the strongly fortified system\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the heavens above you? Don't you see the sun by means\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof which you are receiving your light and heat? Don't you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsee the rains which fall from the clouds and help produce\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorn and vegetables and luxuriant gardens? Do these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthings only tell you that the power of the Almighty Being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWho has created them, will be unable to bring about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tResurrection and establish the Next World? Then, from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupreme wisdom which is clearly working in this world\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taround you, do you only understand this that although\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teach part of it and each function of it is purposive, yet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife is meaningless? Nothing could be more absurd and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaningless that after appointing man to the office of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforeman and granting him vast powers of appropriation, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis workhouse, when he leaves the world after fulfilling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this role, he should be let off without any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccountability. He should neither be rewarded and granted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpension on satisfactory work, nor subjected to any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccountability and punishment on unsatisfactory\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformance of duty.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter giving these arguments it has been emphatically\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstated that the Day of Judgment shall certainly come to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpass on its appointed time. No sooner is the Trumpet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsounded than whatever is being foretold shall appear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the eyes, and whether you believe in it today, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot, at that time you will come out in your multitudes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom wherever you would be lying dead and buried to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trender your account. Your denial cannot in any way avert\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis inevitable event.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, in vv. 21-30; it has been stated that every single\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmisdeed of those who do not expect any accountability to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttake place and have thus belied Our Revelations, lies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treckoned and recorded with Us, and Hell is ever lying an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tambush to punish them and punish them fully for all their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoings. Then, in vv. 31-36, the best rewards of those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlived as responsible people in the world and have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovided for their Hereafter beforehand have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned. They have been reassured that they will not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly be rewarded richly for their services but in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taddition they will also be given sufficient gifts.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, the Divine Court in the Hereafter has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdepicted, making it plain that there will be no question\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof somebody's being adamant in the matter of getting his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowers and associates forgiven, none will speak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout leave, and leave will be granted on the condition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat intercession be made only for the one to whom leave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof intercession will have been given, and the intercessor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill say only what is right. Moreover, leave for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercession will be given only for those who had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacknowledged the Truth in the world but were sinners;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trebels of God and rejecters of the Truth will deserve no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercession at all.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe discourse has been concluded with this warning: The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDay the coming of which is being foretold, shall\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcertainly come to pass. Do not think it is yet far off,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is close at hand. Now, whoever wills, let him believe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin it and take the way towards his Lord. But he who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelieves, in spite of the warning, \"will have all his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeeds placed before him: and he will exclaim regretfully:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Oh, would that I were not born in the world!\" At that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime, his regrets will be about the same world of which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the is so enamored today!\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

For the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tangels who are employed to pluck out the soul today can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso be employed to restore the soul tomorrow, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tangels who promptly execute Allah's Commands and conduct\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe affairs of the universe today can also upset the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torder of the universe tomorrow by orders of the same God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand can also bring about a new order.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this the people have been told, so as to say: \"This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twork which you regard as absolutely impossible, is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany difficult for Allah, for which He may have to make\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlengthy preparations. Just a single jolt will upset this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsystem of the world and a second jolt will be enough to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcause you to appear as living beings in the new world. At\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat time the same people who were wont to deny it, would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe trembling with fear and seeing with awe struck eyes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall that they thought was impossible.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, relating the story of the Prophet Moses and Pharaoh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbriefly, the people have been warned to the effect: \"You\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknow full well what fate the Pharaoh met in consequence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof belying the Messenger and rejecting the guidance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrought by him and endeavoring to defeat his mission by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrickery and deceit. If you do not learn any lesson from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit and do not change your ways and attitude accordingly,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou also will have to meet the same fate.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, in vv. 27-13, arguments have been given for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter and life after death. In this regard, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeniers have been asked the question: \"Is your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresurrection a more difficult task or the creation of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thuge Universe which spreads around you to infinite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistances with myriads of its stars and planets? Your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecreation cannot be difficult for the God for Whom this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas an easy task. Thus, after presenting, in a single\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsentence, a decisive argument for the possibility of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter, attention has been drawn to the earth and its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovisions that have been arranged in it for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsustenance of man and animal and of which everything\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttestifies that it has been created with great wisdom for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfulfilling some special purpose. Pointing to this the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestion has been left for the intellect of man to ponder\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor itself and form the opinion whether calling man to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccount after having delegated authority and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponsibilities to a creature like him in this wise\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsystem would be more in keeping with the demands of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twisdom, or that he should die after committing all sorts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof misdeeds in the world and should perish and mix in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdust for ever and should never be called to account as to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thow he employed the authority and fulfilled the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponsibilities entrusted to him. Instead of discussing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis question, in vv. 34-41, it has been said: \"When the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter is established, men's eternal future will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetermined on the criterion as to which of them rebelled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst his God transgressing the bounds of service and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade the material benefits and pleasures his objective of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife and which of them feared standing before his Lord\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand refrained from fulfilling the unlawful desires of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tself.\" This by itself provides the right answer to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove question to every such person who considers it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thonestly, free from stubbornness. For the only rational,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlogical and moral demand of giving authority and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentrusting responsibilities to man in the world is that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the should be called to account on this very basis\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tultimately and rewarded or punished accordingly.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, the question of the disbelievers of Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas to when Resurrection will take place, has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanswered. They asked the Holy Prophet this question over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand over again. In reply it has been said that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknowledge of the time of its occurrence rests with Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talone. The Messenger is there only to give the warning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it will certainly come. Now whoever wishes may mend\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this ways, fearing its coming, and whoever wishes may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehave and conduct himself as he likes, fearless of its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcoming. When the appointed time comes, those very people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho loved the life of this world and regarded its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpleasures as the only object of life, would feel that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey had stayed in the world only for an hour or so.

According\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto them, once some big chiefs of Makkah were sitting in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet's assembly and he was earnestly engaged\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin trying to persuade them to accept Islam. At that very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoint, a blind man, named Ibn Umm Maktum, approached him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto seek explanation of some point concerning Islam. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace) disliked his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterruption and ignored him. Thereupon Allah sent down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah. From this historical incident the period of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe revelation of this Surah can be precisely determined.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the first place, it is confirmed that Hadrat Ibn Umm\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMaktum was one of the earliest converts to Islam. Hafiz\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Hajar and Hafiz Ibn Kathir have stated that he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone of those who had accepted Islam at a very early stage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSecondly, some of the traditions of the Hadith which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelate this incident show that he had already accepted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam and some others show that be was inclined to accept\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit and had approached the Holy Prophet in search of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruth. Hadrat Aishah states that coming to the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet he had said: \"O Messenger of Allah, guide me to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe straight path.\" (Tirmidhi, Hakim, Ibn Hibban, Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJarir, Abu Ya'la. According to Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the had asked the meaning of a verse of the Quran and said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Holy Prophet: \"O Messenger of Allah, teach me the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknowledge that Allah has taught you.\" Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHatim). These statements show that he had acknowledged\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) as a Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah and the Quran as a Book of Allah. Contrary to this,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Zaid has interpreted the words la allahu yazzakka of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse 3 to mean: la allahu yuslim: \"maybe that he accepts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam.\" (Ibn Jarir) And Allah's own words: \"What would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake you know that he might reform, or heed the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmonition, and admonishing might profit him?\" and \"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone who comes to you running, of his own will, and fears,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom him you turn away\", point out that by that time he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad developed in himself a deep desire to learn the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruth: he had come to the Holy Prophet with the belief\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he was the only source of guidance and his desire\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be satisfied only through him; his apparent state\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso reflected that if he was given instruction, he would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbenefit by it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThirdly, the names of the people who were sitting in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet's assembly at that time, have been given in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifferent traditions. In this list we find the names of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t`Utbah, Shaibah, Abu Jahl, Umayyah bin Khalaf, Ubayy bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhalaf, who were the bitterest enemies of Islam. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshows that the incident took place in the period when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese chiefs were still on meeting terms with the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet and their antagonism to Islam had not yet grown\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso strong as to have stopped their paying visits to him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand having dialogues with him off and on. All these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\targuments indicate that this is one of the very earliest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs to be revealed at Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn view of the apparent style with which the discourse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topens, one feels that in this Surah Allah has expressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis displeasure against the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) for his treating the blind man with indifference\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand attending to the big chiefs exclusively. But when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole Surah is considered objectively, one finds that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdispleasure, in fact, has been expressed against the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelieving Quraish, who because of their arrogant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattitude and indifference to the truth, were rejecting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith contempt the message of truth being conveyed by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace). Then, besides teaching\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim the correct method of preaching, the error of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmethod that he was adopting at the start of his mission\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas also been pointed out. His treating the blind man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith neglect and disregard and devoting all his attention\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Quraish chiefs was not for the reason that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregarded the rich as noble and a poor blind man as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontemptible, and, God forbid, there was some rudeness in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this manner for which Allah reproved him. But, as a matter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof fact, when a caller to Truth embarks on his mission of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconveying his message to the people, he naturally wants\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe most influential people of society to accept his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage so that his task becomes easy, for even if his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvitation spreads among the poor and weak people, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot make much difference. Almost the same attitude had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) also adopted in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeginning, his motive being only sincerity and a desire\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto promote his mission and not any idea of respect for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe big people and hatred for the small people. But Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade him realize that that was not the correct method of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textending invitation to Islam, but from his mission's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoint of view, every man, who was a seeker after truth,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas important, even if he was weak, or poor, and every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman, who was heedless to the truth, was unimportant, even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif he occupied a high position in society. Therefore, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould openly proclaim and convey the teachings of Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto all and sundry, but the people who were really worthy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his attention, were those who were inclined to accept\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Truth, and his sublime and noble message was too high\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto be presented before those haughty people who in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarrogance and vanity thought that they did not stand in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneed of him but rather he stood in need of them.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is the theme of vv. 1-16. From verse 17 onward the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trebuke directly turns to the disbelievers, who were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepudiating the invitation of the Holy Messenger of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace). In this, first they have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treproved for their attitude which they had adopted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst their Creator, Providence and Sustainer. In the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tend, they have been warned of the dreadful fate that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould meet in consequence of their conduct on the Day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tResurrection.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

This Surah was revealed when they had started\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tridiculing the Muslims and disgracing them publicly in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe streets and in their assemblies, but persecution and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanhandling of the Muslims had not yet started. Some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentators regard this as a Madani Surah. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmisunderstanding has been caused by a tradition from Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbbas according to which when the Holy Prophet (upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace) arrived in Madinah, the evil of giving short\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tweight and measure was widespread among the people there.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen Allah sent down Wayl ul-lil mutaffifin and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople began to give full weight and measure. But, as we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave explained in the introduction to Surah Ad-Dahr, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommon practice with the Companions and their successors\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas that when they found that a verse applied to a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcertain matter of life, they would say that it had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsent down concerning that particular matter. Therefore,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat is proved by the tradition of Ibn Abbas is that when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter his emigration to Madinah the Holy Prophet (upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be peace) saw that the evil was widespread among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople there, he recited this Surah before them by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's Command and this helped them mend their ways.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe theme of this Surah too is the Hereafter. In the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst six verses the people have been taken to task for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe prevalent evil practice in their commercial dealings.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen they had to receive their due from others, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemanded that it be given in full, but when they had to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeasure or weigh for others, they would give less than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat was due. Taking this one evil as an example out of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountless evils prevalent in society, it has been said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it is an inevitable result of the heedlessness of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hereafter. Unless the people realized that one day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey would have to appear before God and account for each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsingle act they performed in the world, it was not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible that they would adopt piety and righteousness in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir daily affairs. Even if a person might practice\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thonesty in some of his less important dealings in view of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"honesty is the best policy\", he would never practice\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thonesty on occasions when dishonesty would seem to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"the best policy\". Man can develop true and enduring\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thonesty only when he fears God and sincerely believes in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hereafter, for then he would regard honesty not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmerely as \"a policy\" but as \"a duty\" and obligation, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this being constant in it, or otherwise, would not be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdependent on its being useful or useless in the world.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThus, after making explicit the relation between morality\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the doctrine of the Hereafter in an effective and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timpressive way, in vv. 7-17, it has been said: The deeds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the wicked are already being recorded in the black\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlist of the culprits, and in the Hereafter they will meet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith utter ruin. Then in vv. 18-28, the best end of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvirtuous has been described and it has been laid that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir deeds are being recorded in the list of the exalted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople, on which are appointed the angels nearest to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, the believers have been consoled, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers warned, as if to say: \"The people who are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisgracing and humiliating the believers today, are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tculprits who, on the Resurrection Day, will meet with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost evil end in consequence of their conduct, and these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvery believers will feel comforted when they see their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfate.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

It has been stated that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theavens on that Day will split asunder, the earth will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspread out plain and smooth, and it will throw out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhatever lies inside it of the dead bodies of men and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevidences of their deeds so as to become completely empty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom within. The argument given for it is that such will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe the Command of their Lord for the heavens and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearth; since both are His creation. they cannot dare\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisobey His Command.

At that time all human beings will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivide into two parts: first those whose records will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven in their right hands: they will be forgiven without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany severe reckoning; second those whose records will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven them behind their back. They will wish that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould die somehow, but they will not die; instead they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill be cast into Hell.

Their moving gradually\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the life of the world to the meting out of rewards\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand punishments in the Hereafter was as certain as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappearance of twilight after sunset, the coming of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnight after the day, the returning of men and animals to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir respective abodes at night, and the growing of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcrescent into full moon.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, the disbelievers who repudiate the Quran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstead of bowing down to God when they hear it, have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen forewarned of a grievous punishment and the good\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnews of limitless rewards has been given to the believers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the righteous.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

By means of this story the believers and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe disbelievers have been taught a few lessons. First,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat just as the people of the ditch became worthy of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's curse and punishment, so are the chiefs of Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso becoming worthy of it. Second, that just as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers at that time had willingly accepted to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrifice their lives by being burnt to death in the pits\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof fire instead of turning away from the faith, so also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe believers now should endure every persecution but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould never give up the faith. Third, that God,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacknowledging Whom displeases the disbelievers and is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\turged on by the believers, is Dominant and Master of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKingdom of the earth and heavens; He is self-praiseworthy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand is watching what the two groups are striving for.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, it is certain that the disbelievers will not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly be punished in Hell for their disbelief but, more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan that, they too will suffer punishment by fire as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfit recompense for their tyranny and cruelties. Likewise,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis also is certain that those, who believe and follow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tup their belief with good deeds, should go to Paradise\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand this indeed is the supreme success. Then the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers have been warned, so as to say: \"God's grip\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis very severe. If you are proud of the strength of your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thosts, you should know that the hosts of Pharaoh and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThamud were even stronger and more numerous.

Then man has been asked to consider his own self as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto how he has been brought into existence from a mere\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsperm drop and shaped into a living human being. Then it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been said that the God, Who has so brought him into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texistence, has certainly the power to create him once\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagain, and this resurrection will be for the purpose to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubject to scrutiny all the secrets of man which remained\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thidden in the world. At that time, man will neither be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\table to escape the consequences of his deeds by his own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpower, nor will anyone else come to his rescue.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, it has been pointed out that just as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfalling of rain from the sky and the sprouting of plants\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand crops from the earth is no child's play but a serious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttask, so also the truths expressed in the Quran are no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjest but a firm and unchangeable reality. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers are involved in the misunderstanding that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir plans and devices will defeat the invitation of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran, but they do not know that Allah too is devising a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplan which will bring to nought all their scheming and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplanning. Then in one sentence the discourse has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsummed up, with a word of consolation to the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) and a tacit warning to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers, saying: \"Have patience for a while: let the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers do their worst. Before long they will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves realize whether they have been able to defeat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran by their scheming or the Quran has dominated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem in the very place where they are exerting their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tutmost to defeat it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

If this verse is read along with verse 114 of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Ta Ha and verses 16-19 of Al-Qiyamah and the three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverses are also considered with regard to their styles\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand contexts, the sequence of events seems to be that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst in this Surah the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas reassured to the effect: \"Do not at all worry: We\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshall enable you to recite this Word, then you shall not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforget it.\" Then after a lapse of time, on another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccasion, when the Surah Al-Qiyamah was being revealed,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet involuntarily began to rehearse the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords of the Revelation. Thereupon it was said: \"O\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet do not move your tongue to remember this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRevelation hastily. It is for Us to have it remembered\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand read. Therefore when We are reciting it, listen to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits recital carefully. Again, it is for Us to explain its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaning.\" Last of all, on the occasion of the revelation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Surah Ta Ha, the Holy Prophet on account of human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tweakness, again became afraid lest his memory should fail\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto preserve some portion of the 113 verses which were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinuously revealed at that time, and therefore, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegan to memorize them. Thereupon, it was said: \"And see\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat you do not hasten to recite the Quran before its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation is completed to you.\" After this, it never so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappened that he felt any such danger, for apart form\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese three places, there is no other place in the Quran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhere there might be a reference to this matter.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis short surah contains three themes.Tauhid,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstructions to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hereafter.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the first verse, the doctrine of Tauhid has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompressed into a single sentence, saying that Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tname should be glorified and exalted, i.e. He should not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe remembered by any name which mighty reflect a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeficiency, fault, weakness, or an aspect of likeness,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith created beings, for the root of all false creeds in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe world are wrong concepts about Allah, which assumed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe form of an erroneous name for His glorious and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texalted Being. Therefore, for the correction of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreed, the primary thing is that Allah Almighty should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremembered only by the beautiful names which suit and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefit Him.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the next three verses, it has been said: \"Your Lord,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tglorification of Whose name is being enjoined, is He Who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreated everything in the Universe, proportioned it, set\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit a destiny, taught it to perform the function for which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is created, and you witness this manifestation of His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpower day and night that He creates vegetation on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearth as well as reduces it to mere rubbish.

It is for Us to preserve\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit in your memory, and its preservation is not in any way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe result of any excellence in you but the result of Our\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbounty and favor, otherwise if We so will, We can cause\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou to forget it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttold: \"You have not been made responsible to bring\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teveryone on to the right path; your only duty is to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconvey the truth, and the simplest way of conveying the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruth is that admonition be given to him who is inclined\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto listen to the admonition and accept it, and the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho is not inclined to it, should not be pursued. The one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho fears the evil consequences of deviation and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfalsehood, will listen to the truth and accept it, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe wretched one who avoids listening to and accepting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit, will himself see his evil end.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe discourse has been summed up, saying: \"Success is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly for those who adopt purity of belief, morals and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeed, and remember the name of their Lord and perform the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPrayer. But, on the contrary, the people are wholly lost\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin seeking the ease, benefits and pleasures of the world,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhereas they should actually endeavor for their well\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing in the Hereafter, for the world is transitory and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hereafter everlasting and the blessings of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter are far better than the blessings of the world.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis truth has not been expressed only in the Quran but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the books of the Prophets Abraham and Moses too, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad been brought to the notice of man.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Let us now consider the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubject matter and the style of this Surah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt the outset, in order to arouse the people from their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theedlessness, they have been plainly asked:\"Do you have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany knowledge of the time when an overwhelming calamity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill descend?\" Immediately after this details of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timpending calamity are given as to how the people will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivided into two separate groups and will meet separate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tends. One group of the people will go to Hell and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill suffer punishment; the second group will go to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsublime Paradise and will be provided with blessings.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter thus arousing the people the theme suddenly changes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the question is asked: Do not these people, who frown\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand scorn the teaching of Tauhid and the news of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter being given by the Quran, observe the common\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthings which they experience daily in their lives? Do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey never consider how the camels, on whom their whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife activity in the Arabian desert depends, came into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing, endowed precisely with the same characteristics as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere required for the beast needed in their desert life?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen they go on their journeys, they see the sky, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmountains, or the earth. Let them ponder over these three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tphenomena and consider as to how the sky was stretched\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove them, how the mountains were erected and how the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearth was spread beneath them? Has all this come about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout the skill and craftsmanship of an All-Powerful,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAll Wise Designer? If they acknowledge that a Creator has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreated all this with great wisdom and power and that no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone else is an associate with Him in their creation, why\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen do they refuse to accept Him alone as their Lord and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSustainer? And if they acknowledge that that God had the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpower to create all this, then on what rational ground do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey hesitate to acknowledge that that God also has the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpower to bring about Resurrection, to recreate man, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto make Hell and Heaven?\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter making the truth plain by this concise and rational\\n\\t\\t\\t\\targument, the address turns from the disbelievers to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace) and he is told: \"If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese people do not acknowledge the truth, they may not;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou have not been empowered to act with authority over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem, so that you should coerce them into believing: your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly task is to exhort, so exhort them.

Let us consider the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treasoning in the order in which it has been presented.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst of all, swearing oaths by the dawn, the ten nights,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe even and the odd, and the departing night, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlisteners have been asked: \"Are these things not enough\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto testify to the truth of that which you are refusing to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacknowledge?\" From the explanation that we have given of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese four things in the corresponding notes, it will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome clear that these things are a symbol of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregularity that exists in the night and day, and swearing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toaths by these the question has been asked in the sense:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEven after witnessing this wise system established by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod, do you still need any other evidence to show that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis not beyond the power of that God Who has brought about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis system to establish the Hereafter, and that it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe very requirement of his wisdom that He should call\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman to account for his deeds?\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, reasoning from man's own history, the evil end of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Ad and the Thamud and Pharaoh has been cited as an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texample to show that when they transgressed all limits\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand multiplied corruption in the earth, Allah laid upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem the scourge of His chastisement. This is a proof of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fact that the system of the universe is not being run\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby deaf and blind forces, nor is the world a lawless\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkingdom of a corrupt ruler, but a Wise Ruler is ruling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover it, the demand of Whose wisdom and justice is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinuously visible in the world itself in man's own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory that He should call to account, and reward and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunish accordingly, the being whom He has blessed with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason and moral sense and given the right of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappropriation in the world.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, an appraisal has been made of the general\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmoral state of human society of which Arab paganism was a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconspicuous example; two aspects of it in particular,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been criticized: first the materialistic attitude of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people on account of which overlooking the moral good\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand evil, they regarded only the achievement of worldly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twealth, rank and position, or the absence of it, as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcriterion of honor or disgrace, and had forgotten that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneither riches was a reward nor poverty a punishment, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Allah is trying man in both conditions to see what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattitude he adopts when blessed with wealth and how he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehaves when afflicted by poverty. Second, the people's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattitude under which the orphan child in their society\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas left destitute on the death of the father. Nobody\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked after the poor; whoever could, usurped the whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theritage left by the deceased parent, and drove away the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tweak heirs fraudulently. The people were so afflicted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith an insatiable greed for wealth that they were never\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsatisfied however much they might hoard and amass. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcriticism is meant to make them realize as to why the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople with such an attitude and conduct in the life of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe world should not be called to account for their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmisdeeds.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe discourse has been concluded with the assertion that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccountability shall certainly be held and it will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theld on the Day when the Divine Court will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablished. At that time the deniers of the judgment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill understand that which they are not understanding now\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin spite of instruction and admonition, but understanding\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen will be of no avail. The denier will regret and say,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Would that I had provided for this Day beforehand while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI lived in the world.\" But his regrets will not save him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Allah's punishment. However, as for the people who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould have accepted the Truth, which the heavenly books\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Prophets of God were presenting, with full\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsatisfaction of the heart in the world, Allah will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpleased with them and they will be well pleased with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trewards bestowed by Allah.

Its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheme is to explain the true position of man in the world\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand of the world in relation to man and to tell that God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas shown to man both the highways of good and evil, has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso provided for him the means to judge and see and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollow them, and now it rests upon man's own effort and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjudgment whether he chooses the path of virtue and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treaches felicity or adopts the path of vice and meets\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith doom.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst, the city of Makkah and the hardships being faced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherein by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate of the children of Adam have been cited as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twitness to the truth that this world is not a place of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trest and ease for man, where he might have been born to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoy life, but here he has been created into toil and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstruggle. If this theme is read with verse 39 of Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn-Najm (Laisa lil insani illa ma saa: there is nothing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor man but what he has striven for), it becomes plain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat in this world the future of man depends on his toil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand struggle, effort and striving.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this, man's misunderstanding that he is all in all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin this world and that there is no superior power to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twatch what he does and to call him to account, has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefuted.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, taking one of the many moral concepts of ignorance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theld by man, as an example, it has been pointed out what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrong criteria of merit and greatness he has proposed for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself in the world. The person who for ostentation and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisplay squanders heaps of wealth, not only himself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprides upon his extravagances but the people also admire\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim for it enthusiastically, whereas the Being Who is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twatching over his deeds, sees by what methods he obtained\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe wealth and in what ways and with what motives and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintention he spent it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen Allah says: We have given man the means of knowledge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the faculties of thinking and understanding and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topened up before him both the highways of virtue and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvice: one way leads down to moral depravity, and it is an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teasy way pleasing for the self; the other way leads up to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmoral heights, which is steep like an uphill road, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscaling which man has to exercise self- restraint. It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman's weakness that he prefers slipping down into the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabyss to scaling the cliff.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, Allah has explained what the steep road is by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowing which man can ascend to the heights. It is that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the should give up spending for ostentation, display and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpride and should spend his wealth to help the orphans and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe needy, should believe in Allah and His Religion and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjoining the company of believers should participate in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe construction of a society which should fulfill the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemands of virtue and righteousness patiently and should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe compassionate to the people. The end of those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollow this way is that they would become worthy of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's mercies. On the contrary, the end of those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollow the wrong way, is the fire of Hell from which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is no escape.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

The first part consists of vv. 1-10, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecond of vv. 11-15. The first part deals with three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthings: \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat just as the sun and the moon, the day and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe night, the earth and the sky, are different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom each other and contradictory in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\teffects and results, so are the good and the evil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdifferent from each other and contradictory in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir effects and results; they are neither alike\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin their outward appearance nor can they be alike\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin their results.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat Allah after giving the human self powers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe body, sense and mind has not left it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tuninformed in the world, but has instilled into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\this unconscious by means of a natural inspiration\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe distinction between good and evil, right and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twrong, and the sense of the good to be good and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof the evil to be evil.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat the future of man depends on how by using\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe powers of discrimination, will and judgment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Allah has endowed him with, he develops the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgood and suppresses the evil tendencies of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tself. If he develops the good inclination and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfrees his self of the evil inclinations, he will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tattain to eternal success, and if, on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcontrary, he suppresses the good and promotes the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tevil, he will meet with disappointment and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfailure.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the second part, citing the historical precedent of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people of Thamud, the significance of Apostleship has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen brought out. A Messenger is raised in the world,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause the inspirational knowledge of good and evil that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah has placed in human nature is by itself not enough\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the guidance of man, but on account of his failure to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstand it fully man has been proposing wrong criteria\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand theories of good and evil and thus going astray. That\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis why Allah sent down clear and definite Revelation to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophets (peace be upon them) to augment man's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnatural inspiration so that they may expound to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople as to what is good and what is evil. Likewise, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Salih (peace be upon him) was sent to the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Thamud, but the people overwhelmed by the evil of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir self, had become so rebellious that they rejected\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim. And when he presented before them the miracle of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshe camel, as demanded by themselves, the most wretched\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone of them, in spite of his warning, hamstrung it, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccordance with the will and desire of the people.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConsequently, the entire tribe was overtaken by a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisaster.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhile narrating this story of the Thamud nowhere in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah has it been said \"O people of Quraish, if you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trejected your Prophet, Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace and blessings), as the Thamud had rejected theirs,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou too would meet with the same fate as they met.\"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions at that time in Makkah were similar to those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat had been created by the wicked among the people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThamud against the Prophet Salih (peace be upon him).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, the narration of this story in those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions was by itself enough to suggest to the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Makkah how precisely this historical precedent applied\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto them.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

It is one and the same thing which has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplained in Surah Ash-Shams in one way and in this Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin another. This indicates that both these Surahs were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsent down in about the same period.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIts theme is to distinguish between the two different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tways of life and to explain the contrast between their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tultimate ends and results. In view of the subject matter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah consists of two parts, the first part\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsisting of vv. 1-11 and the second of vv. 12-21.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the first part, at the outset it has been pointed out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the strivings and doings that the individuals,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnations and groups of mankind are engaged in in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld, are, in respect of their moral nature, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivergent as the day is from the night, and the male from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe female. After this, according to the general style of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe brief Surahs of the Quran, three moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharacteristics of one kind and three moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharacteristics of the other kind have been presented as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan illustration from among a vast collection of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrivings and activities of man, from which every man can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjudge which style of life is represented by one kind of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe characteristics and which style of life by the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkind. Both these styles have been described in such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrief, elegant, and pithy sentences that they move the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theart and go down into memory as soon as one hears them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCharacteristics of the first kind are that one should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspend one's wealth, adopt God-consciousness and piety,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand acknowledge the good as good. The second kind of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharacteristics are that one should be miserly, should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleast care for God's pleasure and His displeasure, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould repudiate what is good and right. Then it has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstated that these two modes of action which are clearly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivergent, cannot be equal and alike in respect of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresults. But, just as they are divergent in their nature,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso they are divergent in their results. The person (or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgroup of persons) who adopts the first mode of action,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah will make easy for him the correct way of life, so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmuch so that doing good will become easy for him and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoing evil difficult. On the contrary, he who adopts the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecond mode of life, Allah will make easy for him the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifficult and hard way of life, so much so that doing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevil will become easy for him and doing good difficult.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis passage has been concluded with a most effective and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttouching sentence, saying: \"This worldly wealth for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsake of which man is even prepared to risk his life: will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot go down with him into the grave; therefore, what will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit avail him after death?\"'\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the second part also three truths have been stated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tequally briefly. First, that Allah has not left man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuninformed in the examination hall of the world, but He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas taken on Himself the responsibility to tell him which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone is the straight and right way out of the different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tways of life. Here, there was no need to point out that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby sending His Messenger and His Book. He has fulfilled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis responsibility, for both the Messenger and the Book\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere present to afford the guidance. Second, that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMaster of both the world and the Hereafter is Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talone. If you seek the world, it is He Who will give it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand if you seek the Hereafter, again it is He Who will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgive it. Now, it is for you to decide what you should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseek from Him. The third truth that has been stated is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the wretched one who rejects the good, which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing presented through the Messenger and the Book, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tturns away from it, will have a blazing fire ready for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim. As for the God fearing person who spends his wealth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin a good cause, without any selfish motive, only for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsake of winning his Lord's good pleasure, his Lord will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe pleased with him and will bless him with so much that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the will be well pleased with Him.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Traditions also show that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe revelations were suspended for a time, which caused\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeeply distressed and grieved. On this account he felt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvery anxious that perhaps he had committed some error\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause of which his Lord had become angry with him and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad forsaken him. Thereupon he was given the consolation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat revelation had not been stopped because of some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdispleasure but this was necessitated by the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpediency as underlies the peace and stillness of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnight after the bright day, as if to say: \"If you had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinuously been exposed to the intensely bright light\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Revelation (Wahi) your nerves could not have endured\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit. Therefore, an interval was given in order to afford\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou peace and tranquillity.\" This state was experienced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the Holy Prophet in the initial stage of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood when he was not yet accustomed to hear the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintensity of Revelation. On this basis, observance of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpause in between was necessary. This we have already\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplained in the introduction to Surah Al Muddaththir;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand in E. N. 5 of Surah Al-Muzzammil also we have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplained what great burden of the coming down of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRevelation he had to bear. Later, when the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeveloped the power to bear this burden, there was no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlonger any need for long gaps.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIts theme is to console the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) and its object to remove his anxiety and distress,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich he had been caused by the suspension of Revelation.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst of all, swearing an oath by the bright morning and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe stillness of night, he has been reassured, so as to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay: \"Your Lord has not at all forsaken you, nor is he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdispleased with you.\" Then, he has been given the good\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnews that the hardships that he was experiencing in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinitial stage of his mission, would not last long, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery later period of life for him would be better than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe former period, and before long Allah would bless him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso abundantly that he would be well pleased. This is one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the express prophecies of the Quran, which proved\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tliterally true, afterwards, whereas when this prophecy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas made there seemed not to be the remotest chance that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe helpless and powerless man who had come out to wage a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twar against the ignorance and paganism of the entire\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnation, would ever achieve such wonderful success.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, addressing His Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah says:\"O My dear Prophet, what has caused you the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanxiety and distress that your Lord has forsaken you, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat We are displeased with you? Whereas the fact is that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWe have been good to you with kindness after kindness\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tever since the day of your birth. You were born an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torphan, We made the best arrangement for your upbringing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand care: you were unaware of the Way, We showed you the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWay; you were indigent, We made you rich. All this shows\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat you have been favored by Us from the very beginning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Our grace and bounty has been constantly focused on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou.\" Here, one should also keep in view vv. 37-42 of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Ta Ha, where Allah, while sending the Prophet Moses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto confront a tyrant like Pharaoh, encouraged and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsoled him, saying: \"We have been looking after you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith kindness ever since your birth; therefore, you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be satisfied that you will not be left alone in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis dreadful mission.

Before his call he never had to encounter the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions which he suddenly had to encounter after it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen he embarked on his mission of inviting the people to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam. This was by itself a great revolution in his own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife of which he had no idea in his life before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood. No sooner had he started preaching the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage of Islam than the same society which had esteemed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim with unique honor, turned hostile to him. The same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelatives and friends, the same clansmen and neighbors,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho used to treat him with the highest respect, began to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshower him with abuse and invective. No one in Makkah was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprepared to listen to him; he began to be ridiculed and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmocked in the street and on the road; and at every step\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the had to face new difficulties. Although gradually he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecame accustomed to the hardships, even much severer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tones, yet the initial stage was very discouraging for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim.

The first is the blessing of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSharh Sadr (opening up of the breast), the second of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremoving from you the heavy burden that was weighing down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour back before the call, and the third of exalting your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trenown the like of which has never been granted to any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman before.

This same thing has been described\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Surah Ad-Duha, saying: \"Every later period is better\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor you than the former period, and soon your Lord will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgive you so much that you will be well pleased.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, the Holy Prophet has been instructed, so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas to say, \"You can develop the power to bear and resist\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe hardships of the initial stage only by one means, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is this: `When you are free from your occupations, you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould devote yourself to the labour and toil of worship,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand turn all your attention exclusively to your Lord'.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis same instruction has been given him in much greater\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetail in Surah Al-Muzzammil 1-9.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Two different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tviews have been reported from lbn Abbas: first that it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta Makki Surah, and second that it is Madani. But the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmajority of scholars regard it as a Makki revelation, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanifest symbol of which is the use of the words\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadh-al-balad-il-amin (this city of peace) for Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tObviously, if it had been revealed at Madinah, it would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot be correct to use the words \"this city\" for Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBesides, a study of the contents of the Surah shows that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit belongs to the earliest period of Makkah, for in it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is no sign whatever to indicate that during the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod of its revelation any conflict had started between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam and unbelief. Moreover, it reflects the same style\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the earliest revelations of Makkah period in which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbriefly and succinctly the people have been made to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealize that the judgment of the Hereafter is necessary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand absolutely rational.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIts theme is the rewards and punishments of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter. For this purpose first swearing an oath by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thabitats of some illustrious Prophets, it has been stated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Allah has created man in the most excellent of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmolds. Although at other places in the Quran, this truth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been expressed in different ways, for example, at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome places it has been said: \"Allah appointed man His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvicegerent on the earth and commanded the angels to bow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown to him (Al-Baqara: 30,34, Al-Anam: 165, Al-Araf: 11,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Hijr 28,29, An-Naml: 62, Suad 71- 73);\" at others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat: \"Man has become bearer of the Divine trust, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe earth and the heavens and the mountains did not have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe power to bear (Al-Ahzab 72);\" and at still others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat: \"We honored the children of Adam and exalted them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove many of Our other creatures (Banl Israel 70),\" yet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\there the statement made on oath in particular by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thabitats of the Prophets that man has been created in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfinest of molds, signifies that mankind has been blessed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith such an excellent mould and nature that it gave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbirth to men capable of attaining to the highest position\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Prophethood, a higher position than which has not been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattained by any other creature of God.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, it has been stated that there are two kinds of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen:. those who in spite of having been created in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfinest of mould, become inclined to evil and their moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdegeneration causes them to be reduced to the lowest of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe low, and those who by adopting the way of faith and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trighteousness remain secure from the degeneration and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsistent with the noble position, which is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary demand of their having been created in the best\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof molds. The existence among mankind of both these kinds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof men is such a factual thing which no one can deny, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is being observed and experienced in society\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teverywhere at all times.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, this factual reality has been used as an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\targument to prove that when among the people there are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese two separate and quite distinct kinds, how can one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeny the judgment and retribution for deeds? If the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmorally degraded are not punished and the morally pure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand exalted are not rewarded and both end in the dust\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talike, it would mean that there is no justice in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKingdom of God; whereas human nature and common sense\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemand that a judge should do justice. How then can one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconceive that Allah, Who is the most just of all judges,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould not do justice?\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

About the first part a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreat majority of the Islamic scholars are agreed that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforms the very first Revelation to be sent down to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this regard, the Hadith from Hadrat Aishah, which Imam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad, Bukhari, Muslim, and other traditionists have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated with several chains of authorities, is one of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost authentic hadith on the subject. In it Hadrat Aishah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas narrated the full story of the beginning of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation as she herself heard it from the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah. Besides, Ibn Abbas, Abu Musa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Ashari and a group of the Companions also are reported\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto have stated that these were the very first verses of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran to be revealed to the Holy Prophet. The second\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpart was sent down afterwards when the Holy Prophet (upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be peace) began to perform the prescribed Prayer in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe precincts of the Kabah and Abu Jahl tried to prevent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim from this with threats.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Beginning of Revelation</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe traditionists have related on the strength of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trespective authorities the story of the beginning of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation from Iman Az-Zuhri, who had it from Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUrwah bin Zubair, who had it from Hadrat Aishah, his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taunt. She states that revelations to the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) began in the form of true (according\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto other traditions, good) visions. Whichever vision he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaw it seemed as though he saw it in broad daylight.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfterwards solitude became dear to him and he would go to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Cave of Hira to engage in worship there for several\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays and nights (Hadrat Aishah has used the word\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttahannuth, which Imam Zuhri has explained as ta'abbud:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdevotional exercises. This was some kind of worship which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the performed, for until then he had not been taught the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmethod of performing the Prayer by Allah). He would take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovisions with him and stay there for several days, then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould return to Hadrat Khadijah who would again provide\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor him for a few more days. One day when he was in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCave of Hira, Revelation came down to him unexpectedly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Angel said, to him: \"Read\". After this Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAishah reports the words of the Holy Prophet himself, to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe effect, \"I said: I cannot read! Thereupon the Angel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttook me and pressed me until I could bear it no more.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen he left me and said: Read. I said: I cannot read! He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpressed me a second time until I could bear it no more.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen he left me and said: Read. I again said: I cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tread! He pressed me for the third time until I could bear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit no more. Then he left me and said: Iqra bismi Rabbi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkal- ladhi khalaqa: (Read in the name of your Lord Who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreated) till he reached ma lam ya lam (what he did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknow).\" Hadrat Aishah says: \"Then the Holy Messenger\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) returned home to Hadrat Khadijah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrembling with fear, and said to her: `Cover me, cover\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tme', and he was covered. When terror left him, he said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t`O Khadijah, what has happened to me?' Then he narrated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto her whatever had happened, and said: `I fear for my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife'. She said; `No never! Be of good cheer. By God,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnever will God debase you: you treat the kindred well,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou speak the truth, (one tradition adds: you restore\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat is entrusted to you), you bear the burden of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelpless, you help the poor, you entertain the guests,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand you cooperate in good works.' Then she took him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWaraqah bin Naufal, who was her cousin. He had become a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChristian in pre-Islamic days, wrote the Gospel in Arabic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Hebrew, and had become very old and blind. Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhadijah said: `Brother, listen to the son of your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrother.' Waraqah said to the Holy Prophet: `What have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou seen, nephew?' The Holy Prophet described what he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseen. Waraqah said; `This is the same Namus (the Angel of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRevelation) which Allah had sent down to Moses. Would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat I were a young man during your Prophethood! Would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat I were alive when your tribe would expel you!' The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet said: `Will they expel me?' Waraqah said;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t`Yes, never has it so happened that a person brought what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou have brought and was not treated as an enemy. If I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlive till then I would help you with all the power at my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommand.' But not very long after this Waraqah died.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis narrative is explicit that even until a moment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the coming Angel the Holy Messenger of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintimately aware of his life, his affairs and dealings.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen he also heard of his experience, she did not regard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit as an evil suggestion, but immediately said that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas the Namus who had descended on Moses (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim). This meant that even according to him the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet was such a sublime person that there was nothing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurprising in his being elevated to the office of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Occasion of Revelation of vv. 6-19</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis second part of thee Surah was revealed when the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah began to perform the Prayer in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic way in the Ka'bah and Abu Jahl threatened and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttried to prevent him from this. It so happened that after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this appointment to Prophethood even before he could start\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreaching Islam openly, he began to perform the Prayer in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe precincts of the Ka'bah in the way Allah taught him;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand from this the Quraish felt for the first time that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad adopted a new religion. The other people were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twatching it with curiosity, but Abu Jahl in his arrogance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand pride threatened the Holy Prophet and forbade him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworship in that way in the Ka'bah. In this connection,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquite a number of the hadith have been related from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Abdullah ibn Abbas and Hadrat Abu Huraira, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmention the foolish behavior of Abu Jahl.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Abu Huraira says that Abu Jahl asked the people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish: \"Does Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessings) set his face on the ground before you?\" When\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey replied in the affirmative, he said: \"By Lat and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUzza, if I ever catch him in that act of worship, I would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tset my foot on his neck and rub his face in the dust.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen it so happened that he saw the Holy Messenger in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat posture and came forward to set his foot on his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneck, but suddenly turned back as if in a fright and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing asked what was the matter, he said there was a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tditch of fire and a terrible apparition between himself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand some wings. On hearing this the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremarked: \"Had he come near me, the angels would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsmitten and torn him to pieces.\" (Ahmad, Muslim, Nasai,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Jarir, Ibn AbI Hatim, Ibn al-Mundhir, lbn Marduyah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Nu'aim Isfahani, Baihaqi).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to lbn Abbas, Abu Jahl said:\"If I caught\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperforming his Prayer by the Ka'bah, I would trample his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneck down.\" When the Holy Prophet heard of it, he said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"If he acted so, the angels would seize him there and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen.\" (Bukhari, Tirmidhi, Nasai, Ibn Jarir, Abdur\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRazzaq, Abd bin Humaid, Ibn al- Mundhir, Ibn Marduyah).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to another tradition from Ibn Abbas, the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet was performing his Prayer at the Maqam Ibrahim.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Jahl passed that way and said: \"O Muhammad, did I not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforbid you this,\" and then he started to threaten him. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treply the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) rebuked him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseverely. There upon he said: \"O Muhammad, on what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrength do you rebuke me?

All\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Ahmad al-Wahidi in his commentary says that this is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe first Surah to be sent down in Madinah. Contrary to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis, Al Mawardi says that occording to the majority of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscholars it is a Makki revelation, and the same view has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tImam Suyuti expressed in Al-Itqan. Ibn Mardayah has cited\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Abbas, Ibn Az Zubair and Hadrat Aishah as saying that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah was revealed at Makkah.

Its being placed just after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Al-Alaq in the arrangement of the Quran by itself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplains that the Holy Book, the revelation of which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegan with the first five verses of Surah Al-Alaq. was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsent down in a destiny making night. It is a glorious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBook and its revelation for mankind is full of blessings.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt the outset, Allah says: \"We have sent it down.\" That\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis, it is not a composition of Muhammad (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace and blessing) himself, but We Ourself have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, it is said that \"We sent it down in the Night of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDestiny.\" Night of Destiny has two meanings and both are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timplied here. First, that it is the night during which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestinies are decided; or, in other words, it is not an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tordinary night like the other nights, but a night in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich destinies are made or marred. The revelation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Book in this night is not merely the revelation of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbook but an event which will change the destiny of not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly the Quraish, or of Arabia, but of, the entire world.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe same thing has been said in Surah Ad-Dukhan for which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplease see Introduction to that Surah and E. N. 3\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthereof. The other meaning is that this is a night of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunique honor, dignity and glory; so much so that it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetter than a thousand months. Thus, the disbelievers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah have been warned, as if to say: \"You on account of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour ignorance regard this Book, which Muhammad (upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be Allah's peace and blessings) has presented, as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcalamity for yourselves and complain that a disaster has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefallen you, whereas the night in which it was decreed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto be sent down was such a blessed night that a task was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccomplished in it for the well being of mankind, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad never been accomplished even during a thousand months\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof history. This also has been said in verse 3 of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAd-Dukhan in another way, which we have explained in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintroduction to that Surah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, it has been stated that in this night the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tangels and Gabriel descend with every decree (which in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse 4 of Surah Ad-Dukhan has been described as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarm-hakim: wise decree) by the leave of their Lord, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is all peace from evening till morning; that is, there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis no interference of evil in it, for all decrees of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah are intended to promote good and not evil.

Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Alaq contains the very first revelation, while Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Qadr shows as to when it was revealed, and in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah it has been explained why it was necessary to send\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta Messenger along with this Holy Book.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst of all the need of sending a Messenger has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplained, saying: The people of the world, be they from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the followers of the earlier scriptures or from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the idolaters, could not possibly be freed from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir state of unbelief, until a Messenger was sent whose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappearance by itself should be a clear proof of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapostleship, and he should present the Book of God before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people in its original, pristine form, which should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe free from every mixture of falsehood corrupting the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearlier Divine Books; and which should comprise sound\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteachings.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, about the errors of the followers of the earlier\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBooks it has been said that the cause of their straying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto different creeds was not that Allah had not provided\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany guidance to them, but they strayed only after a clear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatement of the Right Creed had come to them. From this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit automatically follows that they themselves were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponsible for their error and deviation. Now, if even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the coming of the clear statement through this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger, they continued to stray, their responsibility\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould further increase.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this very connection, it has been stated that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphets who came from Allah and the Books sent down by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHim, did not enjoin anything but that the way of sincere\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand true service to Allah be adopted, apart from all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother ways, no one else's worship, service or obedience\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe mixed with His, the salat be established and the zakat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe paid. This same has been the true religion since ever.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFrom this also it automatically follows that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowers of the earlier scriptures, straying from this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrue religion, have added extraneous things to it, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare false, and Allah's this Messenger has come to invite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem back to, the same original faith.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn conclusion, it has been pointed out clearly that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowers of the earlier Books and the idolaters who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould refuse to acknowledge this Messenger are the worst\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof creatures: their punishment is an everlasting Hell;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the people who would believe and act righteously, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould spend life in the world in awe of God, are the best\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof creatures: their reward is eternal Paradise wherein\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey will live for ever.

Ibn Masud, Ata, Jabir, and Mujahid say that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis a Makki Surah and a statement of Ibn Abbas also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupports this view. On the contrary, Qatadah and Muqatil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay that it is Madina and another statement of Ibn Abbas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso has been cited in support of this view. That it is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadani Surah is reasoned from a tradition from Hadrat Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSa'id Khudri, which Ibn Abi Hatim has related from him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe says: \"When the verse Fa-man ya mal mithqala dharratin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkhairan yarah, wa man ya mal mithqala dharratin sharran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyarah, was revealed, I said: \"O Messenger of Allah, shall\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI really see my deeds? The Holy Messenger replied in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffirmative. I submitted: And every major sin? He replied\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyes. I said: And the minor sins too? He replied yes.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThereupon I exclaimed that I would then be ruined. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet said: Rejoice, O Abu Sa'id, for each good\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tact will be equal to ten good acts like it.\" The basis of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe argument for this Surah's being Madani is that Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Sa'id Khudri was an inhabitant of Madinah and reached\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaturity after the Battle of Uhud. Therefore, if this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah was revealed in his presence, as is apparent from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this statement, it must be a Madani Surah. However, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice that the Companions and their immediate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuccessors followed in respect of the occasion of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation of the verses and Surahs, has already been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplained in the Introduction to Surah Ad-Dahr above.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, a Companion's saying that a verse was sent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown on this or that particular occasion is no proof that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit was sent down on that very occasion. It may well be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat after coming of age when Hadrat Aba Sa'id heard this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah for the first time from the Holy Prophet, terrified\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby its last portion he might have asked the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe questions which we have cited above, and he might\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave narrated the incident saying that when this verse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas revealed he put this and this question to the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet. In the absence of this tradition every reader\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho reads the Quran with understandings will feel that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis a Makki Surah. More than that: from its theme and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstyle he would feel that it must have been sent down in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe earliest stage at Makkah when the fundamental\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprinciples and beliefs of Islam were being presented\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the people in a concise but highly effective way.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme end Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIts theme is the second life after death and presentation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin it before man of the full record of the deeds done by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim in the world. In the first three sentences it has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen told briefly how the second life after death will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttake place and how confounding it will be for man. In the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnext two sentences it has been said that this very earth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton which man has lived and performed all kinds of deeds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthoughtlessly, and about which he never could fancy that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis lifeless thing would at some time in the future bear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twitness to his deeds, will speak out on that Day by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's command and will state in respect of each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindividual person what act he had committed at a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticular time and place.

Bloodshed,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tloot and plunder raged on every side. Tribes were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubjecting tribes to raids, and no one could have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeaceful sleep at night from fear that some enemy tribe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmight raid his settlement early in the morning. Every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArab was fully conscious of this state of affairs and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealized that it was wrong.

He is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tusing the powers and abilities given by God for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperpetrating tyranny and pillage; blinded by the love of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworldly wealth he tries to obtain it by every means,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever impure and filthy, and his own state itself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttestifies that by abusing the powers bestowed by his Lord\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the is being ungrateful to Him.

However, there are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome traditions, on the basis of which it is considered a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadani Surah, and they are as follows:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Hatim has cited Abu Buraidah as saying that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah was sent down concerning the two tribes, Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHarithah and Bani al-Harth, of the Ansar. The two tribes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad first recounted the glories and illustrious deeds of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir living men; then they had gone to the graveyard and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbragged of the glorious deeds of their dead. Thereupon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Divine Revelation Alhakum at takathur came down. But,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif the practice of the Companions and their successors\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerning the occasions of revelation, is kept in view,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis tradition is no argument to prove that Surah At\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTakathur was sent down on that very occasion, but it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshows that this Surah fully applied to the act of the two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribes.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tImam Bukhari and Ibn Jarir have cited this view of Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUbayy bin Ka'b: \"We took the Holy Prophet\" saying: `If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe son of Adam had two valley full of wealth, he would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlong for a third valley; the son of Adam's belly cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe filled but by earth, to be from the Quran until\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAlhakum at takathur was sent down'.\" This Hadith has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregarded as an argument for Surah At-Takathur to be a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadani Surah on the ground that Hadrat Ubayy had become a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim in Madinah. But Hadrat Ubayy's this statement does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot indicate in what sense the Companions regarded this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelonging to the Quran. If it means that they regarded it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas a verse of the Quran, it cannot be acceptable, for a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreat majority of the Companions consisted of the men who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere well aware of each and every word of the Quran; they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould not have the misunderstanding that the Hadith was a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse of the Quran. And if its belonging to the Quran is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken to mean its being derived from the Quran, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttradition can also mean that when the Companions who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentered Islam in Madinah, heard this Surah for the first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime from the Holy Prophet, they thought that it had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed just then, and then about the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove saying they formed the idea that it was derived\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom this very Surah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Jarir Tirmidhi, Ibn al Mundhir and other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditionists have related this view of Hadrat Ali: \"We\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere in doubt about the torment of the grave until\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAlhakum at takathur was sent down.\" This view has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregarded as an argument for Surah At-Takathur to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadani on the ground that the torment of the grave was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst mentioned at Madinah; no mention of it was ever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade at Makkah. But this is wrong. In the Makki Surahs of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran, the torment of the grave has been mentioned at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmany places so clearly that there can he no room for any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch doubt; for example, see Al- An'am: 93, An-Nahl: 28,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Muminun: 99-100, Al- Mu'min: 45-46, which are all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakki Surahs. Therefore, if anything is proved by Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAli's saying, it is that Surah At-Takathur had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed before the revelation of the above mentioned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakki Surahs and its revelation had removed the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions' doubt about the torment of the grave.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThat is why, in spite of these traditions, a great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmajority of the commentators are agreed that this Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis Makki. In our opinion this is not only a Makki Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut in view of its contents and style it is one of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearliest Surahs to be revealed at Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn it the people have been warned of the evil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequences of world worship because of which they spend\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir lives in acquiring more and more of worldly wealth,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaterial benefits and pleasures, and position and power,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttill death, and in vying with one another and bragging\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand boasting about their acquisitions.

In Surah Az-Zilzal, it was said that in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter man's full record will be placed before him and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot an atom's weight of good or evil done by him in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld will have been left unrecorded. In Surah Al-Adiyat,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattention was drawn to the plunder and loot, blood-shed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand vandalism, prevailing in Arabia before Islam; then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaking the people realize that the way the powers given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby God were being abused was indeed an expression of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsheer ingratitude to Him; they were told that the matter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould not end up in the world, but in the second life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter death--not only their deeds but their intentions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand motives too would be examined, and their Lord fully\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell knows which of them deserves what reward or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunishment. In Surah Al-Qariah after depicting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tResurrection the people were warned that in the Hereafter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta man's good or evil end will be dependent on whether the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscale of his good deeds was heavier, or the scale of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevil deeds was heavier: In Surah At-Takathur the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere taken to task for the materialistic mentality\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause of which they remained occupied in seeking\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincrease in worldly benefits, pleasures, comforts and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tposition, and in vying with one another for abundance of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teverything until death overtook them. Then, warning them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the evil consequences of their heedlessness, they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttold that the world was not an open table of food for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen to pick and choose whatever they pleased, but for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery single blessing that they were enjoying in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld, they would have to render an account to their Lord\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Sustainer as to how they obtained it and how they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tused it. In Surah Al-Asr it was declared that each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmember, each group and each community of mankind, even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe entire world of humanity, was in manifest loss, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits members were devoid of Faith and righteous deeds and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the practice of exhorting others to truth and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpatience. Immediately after this comes Surah Al-Humazah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin which after presenting a specimen of leadership of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpre-Islamic age of ignorance, the people have been asked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe question: \"What should such a character deserve if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot loss and perdition?\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

N. 4 of Surah Al-Buruj above,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin retaliation for the persecution of the followers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet Jesus Christ (peace be on him) in Najran by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Jewish ruler Dhu-Nuwas of Yaman, the Christian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkingdom of Abyssinia invaded Yaman and put an end to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHimyarite rule there, and in 525 A.D. this whole land\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassed under Abyssinian control. This happened, in fact,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough collaboration between the Byzantine empire of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConstantinople and the Abyssinian kingdom, for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbyssinians at that time had no naval fleet. The fleet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas provided by Byzantium and Abyssinia sent 70,000 of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits troops by it across the Red Sea to Yaman. At the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toutset one should understand that all this did not happen\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunder the religious zeal but there were economic and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpolitical factors also working behind it, and probably\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese were the real motive, and retaliation for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChristian blood was just an excuse. Since the time the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tByzantine empire had occupied Egypt and Syria, it had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen trying to gain control over the trade going on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween East Africa, India, Indonesia, etc., and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tByzantine dominions: from the Arabs, who had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontrolling it for centuries, so as to earn maximum\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprofits by eliminating the intermediary Arab merchants.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor this purpose, in 24 or 25 B.C., Caesar Augustus sent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta large army under the Roman general, Aelius Gallus,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich landed on the western coast of Arabia, in order to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercept and occupy the sea route between southern\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia and Syria. But the campaign failed to achieve its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobjective on account of the extreme geographical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions of Arabia. After this, the Byzantines brought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir fleet into the Red Sea and put an end to the Arab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade which they carried out by sea, with the result that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were left only with the land route. To capture this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvery land route they conspired with the Abyssinian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChristians and aiding them with their fleet helped them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto occupy Yaman.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Arab historians statements about the Abyssinian army\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat invaded Yaman are different. Hafiz Ibn Kathir says\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it was led by two commanders, Aryat and Abrahah, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to Muhammad bin Ishaq, its commander was Aryat,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Abrahah was included in it. Then both are agreed that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAryat and Abrahah fell out, Aryat was killed in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tencounter, and Abrahah took possession of the country;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen somehow he persuaded the Abyssinian king to appoint\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim his viceroy over Yaman. On the contrary, the Greek\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Syriac historians state that when after the conquest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Yaman, the Abyssinians started putting to death the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYamanite chiefs, who had put up resistance, one of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchiefs, named As-Sumayfi Ashwa (whom the Greek historians\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcall Esymphaeus) yielded to the Abyssinians and promising\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto pay tribute obtained the Abyssinian king's warrant to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe governor over Yaman. But the Abyssinian army revolted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst him and made Abrahah governor in his place. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman was the slave of a Greek merchant of the Abyssinian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseaport of Adolis, who by clever diplomacy had come to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twield great influence in the Abyssinian army occupying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYaman. The troops sent by the Negus to punish him either\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twarned him or were defeated by him. Subsequently, after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe death of the king, his successor was reconciled to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept him as his vicegerent of Yaman. (The Greek\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistorians write him as Abrames and the Syriac historians\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas Abraham. Abrahah perhaps is an Abyssinian variant of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbraham, for its Arabic version is Ibrahim).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis man through passage of time became an independent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\truler of Yaman. He acknowledged the sovereignty of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNegus only in name and described himself as his deputy.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe influence he wielded can be judged from the fact that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the restoration of the dam of Marib in 543 A.D. he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcelebrated the event by holding a grand feast, which was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattended by the ambassadors of the Byzantine emperor,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tking of Iran, king of Hirah, and king of Ghassan. Its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfull details are given in the inscription that Abrahah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstalled on the dam. This inscription is extant and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGlaser has published it.(For further details, see E. N.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t37 of the commentary of Surah Saba).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter stabilizing his rule in Yaman Abrahah turned his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattention to the objective which from the very beginning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof this campaign had been before the Byzantine empire and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits allies, the Abyssinian Christians, i.e. to spread\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChristianity in Arabia, on the one hand, and to capture\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe trade that was carried out through the Arabs between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe eastern lands and the Byzantine dominions, on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother. The need for this increased because the Byzantine\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstruggle for power against the Sasanian empire of Iran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad blocked all the routes of the Byzantine trade with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe East.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTo achieve this objective, Abrahah built in Sana, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcapital of Yaman, a magnificent cathedral, called by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabian historians al-Qalis, al-Qullais, or al-Qulais,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis word being an Arabic version of the Greek word\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEkklesia, church. According, to Mahammad bin lshaq, after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thaving completed the building, he wrote to the Negus,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying: \"I shall not rest until I have diverted the Arabs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpilgrimage to it.\" Ibn Kathir writes that he openly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeclared his intention in Yaman and got it publicly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tannounced. He, in fact, wanted to provoke the Arabs into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoing something which should provide him with an excuse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto attack Makkah and destroy the Ka'bah. Muhammad bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIshaq says that an Arab, enraged at this public\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproclamation somehow went into the cathedral and defiled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit. Ibn Kathir says this was done by a Quraishite and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to Muqatil bin Suleman, some young men of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish had set fire to the cathedral. Either might have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappened, for Abrahah's proclamation was certainly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovocative and in the ancient pre-Islamic age it cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe impossible that an Arab, or a Quraishite youth, might\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been enraged and might have defiled the cathedral,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor set fire to it. But it may well also be that Abrahah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself got this done secretly by his own agent so as to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave an excuse for invading Makkah and thus achieving\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboth his objectives by destroying the Quraish and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintimidating the Arabs. In any case, whatever happened,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen the report reached Abrahah that the devotees of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKa'bah had thus defiled his cathedral, he swore that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould not rest until he had destroyed the Ka'bah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSo, in 570 or 571 A.D., he took 60,000 troops and 13\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telephants (according to another tradition, 9 elephants)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand set off for Makkah. On the way, first a Yamanite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchief, Dhu Nafr by name, mustering an army of the Arabs,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresisted him but was defeated and taken prisoner. Then in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe country of Khath'am he was opposed by Nufail bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHabib al-Khath'am, with his tribe, but he too was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefeated and taken prisoner, and in order to save his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife he accepted to serve him as guide in the Arab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountry. When he reached near Ta'if, Bani Thaqif felt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they would not be able to resist such a big force\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand feeling the danger lest he should destroy the temple\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof their deity Lat, too; their chief, Mas'ud came out to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbrahah with his men, and he told him that their temple\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas not the temple he had come to destroy. The temple He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsought was in Makkah, and they would send with him a man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto guide him there. Abrahah accepted the offer, and Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThaqif sent Abu Righal as guide with him. When they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treached al-Mughammas (or al-Mughammis), a place about 3\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmiles short of Makkah, Abu Righal died, and the Arabs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstoned his grave and the practice survives to this day.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey cursed the Bani Thaqif too, for in order to save the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttemple of Lat they had cooperated with the invaders of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe House of Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to Muhammad bin Ishaq, from al-Mughammas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbrahah sent forward his vanguard and they brought him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe plunder of the people of Tihamah and Quraish, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincluded two hundred camels of Abdul Muttalib, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrandfather of the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis peace). Then, he sent an envoy of his to Makkah with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe message that he had not come to fight the people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah but only to destroy the House (i.e. the Ka'bah).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf they offered no resistance, there would be no cause\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor bloodshed. Abrahah also instructed his envoy that if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people of Makkah wanted to negotiate, he should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn with their leading chief to him. The leading chief\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Makkah at that time was Abdul Muttalib. The envoy went\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto him and delivered Abrahah's message. Abdul Muttalib\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied: \"We have no power to fight Abrahah. This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's House. If He wills He will save His House.\" The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenvoy asked him to go with him to Abrahah. He agreed and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccompanied him to the king. Now Abdul Muttalib was such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta dignified and handsome man that when Abrahah saw him he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas much impressed; he got off his throne and sat beside\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim on the carpet. Then he asked him what he wanted.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdul Muttalib replied that he wanted the king to return\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this camels which he had taken. Abrahah said: \"I was much\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timpressed when I saw you but your reply has brought you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown in my eyes: you only demand your camels but you say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnothing about this House which is your sanctuary and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsanctuary of your forefathers.\" He replied: \"I am the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towner of my camels and am requesting you to return them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs for the House, it has its own Owner: He will defend\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit.\" When Abrahah said that He would not be able to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefend it against him, Abdul Muttalib said that that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trested between Him and him. With this Abdul Muttalib left\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbrahah and he restored to him his camels.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Abbas's tradition is different. It does not mention\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe demand for the camels at all. According to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditions related from him by Abd bin Humaid, Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Mundhir, lbn Marduyah, Hakim, Abu Nuaim and Baihaqi,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the states that when Abrahah reached As- Sifah (a place\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsituated between Arafat and Taif in the mountains near\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sacred bounds of Makkah), Abdul Muttalib went to him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand said: \"There was no need for you to come so far. You\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould have ordered us and we would have brought before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou whatever you needed.\" He said: \"I hear that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse is the House of peace: I have come to destroy its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace.\" Thereupon, Abdul Muttalib said: \"This is Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse. He has not allowed anyone so far to dominate it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbrahah replied: \"We will not return until we have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestroyed it.\" Abdul Muttalib said: \"You may take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhatever you like from us and return.\" Abrahah refused to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbudge and ordered his troops to advance, leaving Abdul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuttalib behind.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLeaving the two traditions as they are, one thing which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecomes evident is that the tribes living in and around\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah did not have the power to fight such a big force\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand save the Ka'bah. Therefore, obviously, the Quraish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid not try to put up any resistance. The Quraish on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccasion of the Battle of the Trench (Ahzab) had hardly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen able to muster strength numbering ten to twelve\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthousand men in spite of the alliance with the pagan and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJewish tribes; they could not have resisted an army\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t60,000 strong.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad bin Ishaq says that after returning from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcamp of Abrahah Abdul Muttalib ordered the Quraish to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithdraw from the city and go to the mountains along with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir families for fear of a general massacre. Then he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twent to the Ka'bah along with some chiefs of the Quraish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand taking hold of the iron ring of the door, prayed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah Almighty to protect His House and its keepers.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere were at that time 360 idols in and around the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKa'bah, but on that critical moment they forgot them and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timplored only Allah for help. Their supplications which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been reported in the books of history do not contain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany name but of Allah, the One. Ibn Hisham in his Life of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet has cited some verses of Abdul Muttalib,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich are to the following effect:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"O God, a man protects his house, so protect Your House;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLet not their cross and their craft tomorrow overcome\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYour craft. If You will to leave them and our qiblah to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves, You may do as You please.\" Suhail in Raud\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Unuf has cited this verse also in this connection:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Help today Your devotees against the devotees of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcross and its worshipers.\" Ibn Jarir has cited Abdul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuttalib's these verses also, which he had recited in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupplication; my Lord, I do not cherish any hope from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanyone against them except You. O my Lord, protect Your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse from them. The enemy of this House is Your enemy.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tStop them from destroying Your settlement.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter making these supplications Abdul Muttalib and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanions also went off to the mountains. Next morning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbrahah prepared to enter Makkah, but his special\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telephant, Mahmud, which was in the forefront, knelt down.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt was beaten with iron bars, goaded, even scarified, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit would not get up. When they made it face south, north,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor east, it would immediately start off, but as soon as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey directed it towards Makkah, it knelt down. In the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeantime swarms of birds appeared carrying stones in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir beaks and claws and showered these on the troops.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhoever was hit would start disintegrating. According to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad bin Ishaq and Ikrimah, this was smallpox, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas seen in Arabia for the first time in that year. Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbbas says that whoever was struck by a pebble, would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstart scratching his body resulting in breaking of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tskin and falling off of the flesh. In another tradition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Abbas says that the flesh and blood flowed like water\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand bones in the body became visible. The same thing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappened with Abrahah too. His flesh fell in pieces and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere arose bores on his body emitting pus and blood. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfusion they withdrew and fled towards Yaman. Nufail\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Habib, whom they had brought as guide from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountry of Khatham, was searched out and asked to guide\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem back to Yaman, but he refused and said: \"Now where\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcan one flee when God pursues?\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe split nose (Abrahah) is the conquered; not the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconqueror.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs they withdrew they were continually falling by the bay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand dying. Ata bin Yasar says that all the troops did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperish at the spot; some perished there and others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperished by the wayside as they withdrew. Abrahah died in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe country of Khatham.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis event took place at Muhassir by the Muhassab valley,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween Muzdalifah and Mina. According to the Sahih of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim and Abu Da'ud, in the description of the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's farewell pilgrimage that Imam Jafar as-Sadiq\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas related from his father, Imam Muhammad Baqir, and he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Hadrat Jabir bin Abdullah, he says that when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace) proceeded from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuzdalifah to Mina, he increased his speed in the valley\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Muhassir. Imam Nawawt has explained it saying that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident of the people of the elephant had occurred\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere; therefore, the pilgrims have been enjoined to pass\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby quickly, for Muhassir is a tormented place. Imam Malik\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Muatta has related that the Holy Prophet said that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole of Muzdalifah is a fit place for staying but one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould not stay in the valley of Muhassir. In the verses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Nufail bin Habib, which Ibn Ishaq has cited, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescribes this event as an eyewitness;\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Would that you had seen, O Rudaina, but you would not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsee, What we saw by the valley of Muhassab. I praised God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen I saw the birds, and I feared lest the stones should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfall upon us. Everyone was asking for Nufail as though I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towned the Abyssinians a debt.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis was such a momentous event that it soon spread\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthroughout Arabia and many poets made it the subject of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir laudatory poems. In these poems one thing is quite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevident that everyone regarded it as a manifestation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah Almighty's miraculous power, and no one, even by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallusion, said that the idols which were worshipped in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Ka'bah, had anything to do with it.

Umm Hani's tradition has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated by Imam Bukhari in his History and by Tabarani,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHakim, Ibn Marduyah and Baihaqi in their collections of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith Hadrat Zubair's statement has been related by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTabarani, Ibn Marduyah and Ibn Asakir, and this is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfurther confirmed by the mursal tradition of Hadrat Sa'id\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin al Musayyab, which Khatib Baghdadi has recorded in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this History.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Arabs describe the year in which this event took\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplace as Am al-Fil (the year of the elephants), and in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same year the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis peace) was born. The traditionists and historians\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talmost unanimously state that the event of the people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe elephant had occurred in Muharram and the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet was born in Rabi al-Awwam. A majority of them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstates that he took birth 50 days after the event of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telephant.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Substance</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf Surah al-Fil is studied in the light of the historical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetails as given above, one can fully well understand why\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin this Surah only Allah's inflicting His punishment on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people of the elephant has been referred and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescribed so briefly. It was an event of recent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurrence, and everyone in Makkah and Arabia was fully\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taware of it. The Arabs believed that the Ka'bah had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprotected in this invasion not by any god or goddess but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Allah Almighty Himself. Then Allah alone had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvoked by the Quraish chiefs for help, and for quite a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfew years the people of Quraish having been impressed by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis event, had worshipped none but Allah. Therefore,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere was no need to mention the details in Surah al-Fil,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut only a reference to it was enough so that the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Quraish, in particular, and the people of Arabia, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeneral, should consider well in their hearts the message\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace and blessings) was giving. For the only message\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he gave was that they should worship and serve none\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut Allah, the Only and One. Then, they should also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsider that if they used force to suppress this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvitation to the truth, they would only be inviting the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrath of God, Who had so completely routed and destroyed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people of the elephants.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

First of all,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQusayy gathered it in Makkah and this tribe was able to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgain authority over the Ka'bah. On that very basis Qusayy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas called mujammi (unite, assembler) by his people. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman by his sagacity and wisdom founded a city state in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah and made excellent arrangements for the welfare of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe pilgrims coming from all over Arabia, with the result\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Quraish were able to gain great influence among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Arabian tribes and lands. After Qusayy the offices of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe state of Makkah were divided between his sons, Abdi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tManaf and Abd ad-Dar, but of the two Abdi Manaf gained\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreater fame even during his father's lifetime and was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theld in high esteem throughout Arabia. Abdi Manaf had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfour sons: Hashim, Abdi Shams, Al-Muttalib, and Naufal.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOf these Hashim, father of Abdul Muttalib and grandfather\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Holy Prophet, first conceived the idea to take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpart in the trade that passed between the eastern\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountries and Syria and Egypt through Arabia, and also to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurchase the necessities of life for the Arabians so that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe tribes living by the trade route bought these from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem and the merchants living in the interior of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountry were attracted to the market of Makkah. This was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe time when the Sasanian kingdom of Iran had captured\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe international trade that was carried out between the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnorthern lands and the eastern countries and Byzantine\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tempire through the Persian Gulf. This had boosted up the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade activity on the trade route leading from southern\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia to Syria and Egypt along the Red Sea coast. As\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst the other Arabian caravans, the Quraish had the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadvantage that the tribes on the route held them in high\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testeem on account off their being keepers of the Ka'bah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey stood indebted to them for the great generosity with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich the Quraish treated them in the Hajj season. That\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis why tube Quraish felt no fear that their caravans\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be robbed or harmed any where on the way. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribes on the way did not even charge them the heavy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttransit taxes that they demanded from the other caravans.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHashim taking advantage of this prepared the trade scheme\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand made his three brothers partners in it. Thus, Hashim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobtained trade privileges from the Ghassanide king of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSyria, Abdi Shams from the Negus, Al-Muttalib from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYamanite nobles and Naufal from the governments of Iraq\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand lran, and their trade began to flourish. That is how\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe four brothers became famous as traders and began to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe called ashab al-ilaf (generators of love and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffection) on account of their friendly relations with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe tribes and states of the surrounding lands.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBecause of their business relations with Syria, Egypt,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIraq, Iran, Yaman and Abyssinia, the Quraish came across\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch opportunities and their direct contact with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tculture and civilization of different countries so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenhanced the level of their knowledge and wisdom that no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribe in Arabia could match and equal them. As regards\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twealth and worldly goods they became the most affluent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribe, and Makkah became the most important commercial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcenter of the Arabian peninsula. Another great advantage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat accursed from these international relations was that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey brought from Iraq tile script which later was used\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor writing down the Quran. No other Arabian tribe could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboast of so many literate people as Quraish. For these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvery reasons the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Quraish are the leaders of men.\" (Mustiad Ahmad:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMarwiyat Amr bin al As). And according to a tradition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Hadrat Ali in Baihaqi, the Holy Prophet said: \"First\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe leadership of the Arabians was in the hands of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of Himyar, then Allah withdrew it from them and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgave it to Quraish\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Quraish were thus prospering and flourishing when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevent of Abrahah's invasion of Makkah took place. Had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbrahah at that time succeeded in taking this holy City\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand destroying the Ka'bah, the glory and renown of not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly the Quraish but of the Ka'bah itself, would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaded away, the belief of the pre-Islamic Arabia that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse indeed was Allah's House would have been shattered,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the high esteem in which Quraish were held for being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkeepers of the House throughout the country would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen tarnished. Then, after the Abyssinian advance to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah, the Byzantium also would have taken the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinitiative to gain control over the trade route between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSyria and Makkah: and the Quraish would have been reduced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto a plight worse than that in which they were involved\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore Qusayy bin Kilab. But when Allah showed this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanifestation of His power that the swarms of birds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestroyed 60,000 Abyssinian troops brought by Abrahah by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpelting them with stones, and from Makkah to Yaman they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twent on falling and dying by the wayside, the faith of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Arabs that the Ka'bah indeed was Allah's House\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincreased manifold, and the glory and renown of Quraish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoo was enhanced considerably throughout the country. Now\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Arabs were convinced that they were under Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecial favor; therefore, they visited every part of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia fearlessly and passed through every land with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir trade caravans unharmed. No one could dare touch\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem with an evil intention. Not to speak of touching\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem, even if they had a non-Quraishunder their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprotection, he too was allowed to pass unharmed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Substance</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs all this was well known in the time of the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's appointment to Prophethood, there was no need\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto mention them.

In our\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topinion there is an internal piece of evidence in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah itself which points to its being a Madani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRevelation. It holds out a threat of destruction to those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpraying ones who are unmindful of their Prayers and who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpray only to be seen. This kind of hypocrites were found\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly at Madinah, for it was there that Islam and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims gained such strength that Islam and the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgained such strength that many people were compelled to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve from expedience, had to visit the Mosque, join\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe congregational Prayer and prayed only to be seen of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers, so as to be counted among Muslims. Contrary to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis is, at Makkah conditions were altogether different.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNo one had to pray to be seen. There it was difficult\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven for the believers to pray in congregation; they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayed secretly and if a person prayed openly he did so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly at the risk of his life. This kind of hypocrites\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfound in Makkah did not comprise those who believed and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPrayed to be seen but those who in their hearts had known\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand acknowledged the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace) to be on the true path, but were avoiding to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept Islam in order to maintain their position of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleadership and authority, or were not prepared to take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe risk of being afflicted with the kind of hardships\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith which they found the believers afflicted in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsociety around them.

But Hadrat Hasan Basri, Ikrimah, Mujahid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Qatadah regard it as Madani. Imam Suyuti in Al-Itqan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas confirmed this same view, and Imam Nawawi in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentary of the Sahih of Muslim has also preferred the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame. The reason for this assumption is the tradition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich traditionists of the rank of Imam Ahmad, Muslim,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Daud, Nasai, Ibn Abi Shaibah, Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMarduyah, Baihaqi and others have related from Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnas bin Malik, saying: \"The Holy Prophet was among us.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the meantime he dozed; then he raised his head,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsmiling, according to some traditions, the people asked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat for he was smiling, according to others, he himself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttold them that a Surah had just been revealed to him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen, with Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim, he recited Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Kauthar; then he asked the people whether they knew\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat Kauthar was. When they said that Allah and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger had the best knowledge, he said; It is a river\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich my Lord has granted me in Paradise.\" (The details\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollow under \"Kauthar\"). The basis of the reasoning from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis tradition for this Surah's being Madani is that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Anas belonged to Madinah, and his saying that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah was revealed in his presence is a proof that it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadani.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut, in the first place, from this same Hadrat Anas, Imam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad, Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi and Ibn Jarir\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave related the traditions which say that this river of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tParadise (Al-Kauthar) had been shown to the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) on the occasion of the miraj\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(ascension) and everyone knows that miraj had taken place\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat Makkah before the hijrah. Secondly, when during the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmiraj the Holy Prophet had not only been informed of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgift of Allah Almighty but also shown it, there was no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason why Surah Al-Kauthar should have be revealed at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah to give him the good news of it. Thirdly, if in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan assembly of the Companions the Holy Prophet himself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad given the news of the revelation of Surah Al-Kauthar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich Hadrat Anas has mentioned in his tradition, and it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeant that that Surah had been revealed for the first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime then, it was not possible that well-informed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions like Hadrat Aishah, Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Hadrat Abdullah bin Zubair should have declared this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah to be a Makki revelation and most of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentators also should have regarded it as Makki. If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe matter is considered carefully, there appears to be a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflaw in the tradition from Hadrat Anas in that it does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot say what was the subject under discussion in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassembly in which the Holy Prophet gave the news about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Al-Kauthar. It is possible that at that time the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet was explaining something. In the meantime he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas informed by revelation that that point was further\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplained by Surah Al-Kauthar, and he mentioned the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthing, saying that that Surah was revealed to him just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen. Such incidents did take place on several occasions,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the basis of which the commentators have opined about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcertain verses that they were revealed twice. This second\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation, in fact, meant that the verse had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed earlier, but on some later occasion the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's attention was invited to it by revelation for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe second time. In such traditions, the mention of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation of a certain verse is not enough to decide\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhether it was revealed at Makkah or Madinah, and when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprecisely it was revealed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHad this tradition of Hadrat Anas not been there to cause\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoubt, the whole content of the Surah Al- Kauthar by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\titself bears evidence that it was revealed at Makkah, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the period when the Holy Prophet was passing through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textremely discouraging conditions.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Historical Background</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBefore this in Surahs Ad-Duha and Alam Nashrah we have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseen that when in the earliest phase of Prophethood the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace) was passing through the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost trying conditions when the whole nation had turned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thostile, there was resistance and opposition on every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tside, and the Holy Prophet and a handful of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions did not see any remote chance of success.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah in order to console and encourage him at that time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad sent down several verses. In Surah Ad-Duha it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: \"And surely the later period (i.e. every later\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod) is better for you than the former period, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsoon your Lord shall give you so much that you shall be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell pleased\". In Surah Alam Nashrah: \"And We exalted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour renown for you.\"That is, \"Though the enemies are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrying to defame you throughout the country, We, on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontrary, have arranged to exalt your name and fame.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd: \"The fact is that along with every hardship there is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso ease.\" That is, \"You should not be disheartened by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe severity of conditions at this time; this period of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thardships will soon pass, and the period of success and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvictory will follow.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSuch were the conditions in which Allah by sending down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Al-Kauthar consoled the Holy Prophet as well as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforetold the destruction of his opponents. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelieving Quraish said: \"Muhammad (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace) is cut off from his community and reduced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto a powerless and helpless individual. According to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIkrimah when the Holy Prophet was appointed a Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand he began to call the people to Islam, the Quraish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: \"Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessings) is cut off from his people as a tree is cut\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toff from its root, which might fall to the ground any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmoment.\" (Ibn Jarir). Muhammad bin Ishaq says: \"Whenever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet (upon whom be peace) was mentioned before As\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Wa'il as-Sehmi, the chief of Makkah, he used to say:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLet him alone for he is only a childless man (abtar) with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno male offspring. When he dies, there will be no one to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremember him.\" Shamir bin Atiyyah says that Uqbah bin Abi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'ait, also used to say similar things about the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, (Ibn Jarir). According to Ibn Abbas, once Ka'b\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Ashraf (the Jewish chief of Madinah) came to Makkah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Quraish chiefs said to him: \"Just see this boy,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho is cut off from his people; he thinks he is superior\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto us, whereas we manage the Hajj, look after the Ka'bah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand water the pilgrims.\" (Bazzar). Concerning this very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident Ikrimah reports that the Quraishhad used the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords as-sunbur al-munbatir min qaumi-hi (a weak,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelpless and childless man who is cut off from his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople) for the Holy Prophet. (Ibn Jarir) Ibn Sa'd and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Asakir have related that Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid; \"The eldest son of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) was Qasim; next to him was Zainab, next to her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Abdullah and next to him three daughters, viz. Umm\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKulthum, Fatimah and Ruqayyah. Of them first Hadrat Qasim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdied and then Hadrat Abdullah. Thereupon As bin Wail\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: \"His line has come to an end: now he is abtar (i.e.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcut off from root).\" Some traditions add that As said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Muhammad is abtar: he has no son to succeed him. When he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdies, his memory will perish and you will be rid of him.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe tradition from Ibn Abbas, which Abd bin Humaid has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated, shows that Abu Jahl also had said similar words\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the death of the Holy Prophet's son, Abdullah. Ibn Abi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHatim has related on the authority of Shmir bin Atiyyah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the same kind of meanness was shown by Uqbah bin Abi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'ait by rejoicing at this bereavement of the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet. Ata says that when the second son of the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet died, his own uncle, Abu Lahab (whose house was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnext to his) hastened to the pagans and gave them the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"good news\": Batira Muhammadun al-lail:\"Muhammad has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome childless this night, or he is cut off from root.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSuch were the disturbing conditions under which Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Kauthar was sent down. The Quraish were angry with him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause he worshipped and served only Allah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepudiated their idolatry publicly. For this very reason\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the was deprived of the rank, esteem and honor that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoyed among his people before Prophethood and was now\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas cut off from his community. The handful of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions also were helpless, poor people who were being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersecuted and tyrannized. Furthermore, he was bereaved\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the death of two sons, one after the other, whereas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe near relatives and the people of his clan,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrotherhood and neighborhood were rejoicing and uttering\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch words as were disheartening and disturbing for a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnoble person who had treated even his enemies most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkindly. At this Allah just in one sentence of this brief\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah gave him the good news, better news than which has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnever been given to any man in the world, besides the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecision that it will be his opponents who will be cut\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toff from their root and not he.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

According to another tradition from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Abbas, the Quraish said to the Holy Prophet: \"O\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad, if you kiss our gods, the idols, we shall\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworship your God.\" Thereupon, this Surah was sent down.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Abd bin Humaid).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSaid bin Mina (the freed slave of Abul Bakhtari) has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated that Walid bin Mughirah, As bin Wail, Aswad bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Muttalib and Umayyah bin Khalaf met the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) and said to him: \"O Muhammad (upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be Allah's peace and blessings), let us agree that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twe would worship your God and you would worship our gods,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand we would make you a partner in all our works.

Although\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit was addressed in the beginning to the disbelieving\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish in response to their proposals of compromise, yet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is not confined to them only, but having made it a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpart of the Quran, Allah gave the Muslims the eternal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteaching that they should exonerate themselves by word\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand deed from the creed of kufr wherever and in whatever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tform it be, and should declare without any reservation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they cannot make any compromise with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelievers in the matter of Faith.

Here, by a little consideration one can easily\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsee the great difference that there is between a Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand a common worldly leader. If a worldly leader in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\town lifetime is able to bring about a revolution, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas the aim and objective of his struggle, this would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan occasion for exultation for him. But here we witness\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquite another phenomenon. The Messenger of Allah in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrief space of 23 years revolutionized an entire nation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas regards its beliefs, thoughts, customs, morals,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcivilization, ways of living, economy, politics and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfighting ability, and raising it from ignorance and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbarbarism enabled it to conquer the world and become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleader of nations; yet when he had accomplished this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunique task, he was not enjoined to celebrate it but to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tglorify and praise Allah and to pray for His forgiveness,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand he busied himself humbly the implementation of that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommand.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Aishah says: \"The Holy Messenger (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) often used to recite Subhanak-Allahumma wa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbi-hamdika astaghfiruka wa atubu ilaika (according to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome other traditions, Subhan Allahi wa bi hamdi-hi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas-taghfirullaha wa atubu ilaihi) before his death. I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked: O Messenger of Allah, what are these words that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou have started reciting now? He replied: A sign has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen appointed for me so that when I see it, I should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecite these words, and it is: Idha jaa nasrullahi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twal-fathu.\" (Musnad Ahmad, Muslim, Ibn Jarir, Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Mundhir, Ibn Marduyah). In some other traditions on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same subject Hadrat Aishah has reported that the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet often recited the following words in his ruku and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsajdah: Subhanak-Allahumma wa-bi hamdika,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllahumma-aghfirli. This was the interpretation of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran (i.e. of Surah An-Nasr) that he had made.(Bukhari,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim Abu Daud, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Ibn Jarir).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Unm Salamah says that the Holy Prophet (upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace) during his last days very often recited the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowing words sitting and standing, going out of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thouse and coming back to it: Subhan Allahi wa-bi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thamdi-hi. I one day asked: \"Why do you recite these words\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso often? O Messenger of Allah\". He replied: I have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoined to do so. Then he recited this Surah. (Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJarir).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to Hadrat Abdullah bin Masud, when this Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas revealed, the Messenger of Allah (upon whom be peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrequently began to recite the words Subhanak-Allahumma\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twa bi-hamdika, Allahumm-aghfirli, subhanaka Rabbana wa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbi-hamdika, Allahumm-aghfirli, innaka anta at-Tawwab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Ghafur.(Ibn Jarir, Musnad Ahmad, Ibn Abi Hatim).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Abbas has stated that after the revelation of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah the Holy Messenger (upon whom be peace) began to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlabor so intensively and devotedly hard for the Hereafter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas he had never done before.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

It may well have been revealed in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod when the Quraish had boycotted the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) together with the people of his clan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand besieged them in Shi'b Abi Talib, and Abu Lahab was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe only person to join with the enemies against his own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelatives. The basis of this assumption is that Abu Lahab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas the Holy Prophet's uncle, and public condemnation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe uncle by the tongue of the nephew could not be proper\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuntil the extreme excesses committed by the uncle had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome visible to everyone. If the Surah had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed before this, in the very beginning, the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould have regarded it as morally discourteous that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnephew should so condemn the uncle.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Background</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is the only place in the Quran where a person from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the enemies of Islam has been condemned by name,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhereas in Makkah as well as in Madinah, after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmigration, there were many people who were in no way less\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinimical to Islam and the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace and blessings) than Abu Lahab. The question\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis, what was the special trait of the character of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson, which became the basis of this condemnation by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tname? To understand that it is necessary that one should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstand the Arabian society of that time and the role\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Abu Lahab played in it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn ancient days since there prevailed chaos and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfusion, bloodshed and plunder throughout Arabia, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe condition since centuries was that a person could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave no guarantee of the protection of life, honor and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty except with the help and support of his clansmen\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand blood relations, therefore silah rehmi (good\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreatment of the kindred) was esteemed most highly among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe moral values of the Arabian society and breaking off\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof connections with the kindred was regarded as a great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsin. Under the influence of the same Arabian tradition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) began to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreach the message of Islam, the other clans of Quraish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand their chiefs resisted and opposed him tooth and nail,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut the Bani Hashim and the Bani al-Muttalib (children of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Muttalib, brother of Hashim) not only did not oppose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim but continued to support him openly, although most of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem had not yet believed in his Prophethood. The other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclans of Quraish themselves regarded this support by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblood relations of the Holy Prophet as perfectly in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccordance with the moral traditions of Arabia. That is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhy they never taunted the Bani Hashim and the Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Muttalib in that they had abandoned their ancestral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaith by supporting a person who was preaching a new\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaith. They knew and believed that they could in no case\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thand over an individual of their clan to his enemies, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir support and aid of a clansman was perfectly natural\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the sight of the Quraish and the people of Arabia.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis moral principle, which the Arabs even in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpre-Islamic days of ignorance, regarded as worthy of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trespect and inviolable was broken only by one man in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenmity of Islam, and that was Abu Lahab, son of Abdul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuttalib. He was an uncle of the Holy Prophet, whose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfather and he were sons of the same father. In Arabia, an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuncle represented the father especially when the nephew\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas fatherless. The uncle was expected to look after the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnephew as one of his own children. But this man in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thostility to Islam and love of kufr trampled all the Arab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditions underfoot.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe traditionists have related from Ibn Abbas with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseveral chains of transmitters the tradition that when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet was commanded to present the message of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam openly, and he was instructed in the Quran to warn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst of all his nearest kinsfolk of the punishment of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod, he ascended the Mount Safa one morning and called\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout aloud: Ya sabahah (O, the calamity of the morning!).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis alarm in Arabia was raised by the person who noticed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearly at dawn an enemy tribe advancing against his tribe.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the Holy Messenger made this call, the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinquired as to who had made the call. They were told that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit was Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace). Thereat the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of all the clans of Quraish rushed out. Everyone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho could, came; he who could not, sent another one for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself. When the People had assembled, the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger calling out each clan by name, viz. O Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHashim, O Bani Abdul Muttalib, O Bani Fir, O Bani so and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso, said: \"If I were to tell you that behind the hill\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere was an enemy host ready to fall upon you, would you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve me?\" The people responded with one voice, saying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they never had so far experienced a lie from him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Holy Prophet said: \"Then I warn you that you are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theading for a torment.\" Thereupon, before anyone else\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould speak, Abu Lahab, the Holy Prophet's uncle, said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"May you perish! Did you summon us for this?\" Another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttradition adds that he picked up a stone to throw at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet. (Musnad Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Jarir, and others).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to Ibn Zaid, one day Abu Lahab asked the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet: \"If I were to accept your religion, what would I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tget?\" The Holy Prophet replied: \"You would get what the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother believers would get.\" He said: \"Is there no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreference or distinction for me?\" The Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied: \"What else do you want?\" Thereupon he said: \"May\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis religion perish in which I and all other people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be equal and alike!\" (Ibn Jarir).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Makkah Abu Lahab was the next door neighbor of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet. Their houses were separated by a wall.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBesides him, Hakam bin As (Father of Marwan), Uqbah bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbi Muait, Adi bin Hamra and Ibn al- Asda il-Hudhali also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere his neighbors. These people did not allow him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave peace even in his own house. Sometimes when he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperforming the Prayer, they would place the goat's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstomach on him; sometimes when food was being cooked in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe courtyard, they would throw filth at the cooking pot.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Holy Prophet would come out and say: \"O Bani Abdi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tManaf, what kind of neighborliness is it?\" Abu Lahab's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twife, Umm Jamil (Abu Sufyan's sister), had made it a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice to cast thorns at his door in the night so that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen he or his children came out of the house at dawn,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey should run thorns in the foot. (Baihaqi, Ibn Abi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHatim, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Asakir, Ibn Hisham).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBefore the proclamation of Prophethood, two of the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's daughters were married to two of Abu Lahab's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsons, Utbah and Utaibah. After his call when the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet began to invite the people to Islam, Abu Lahab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid to both his sons: \"I would forbid myself seeing and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeeting you until you divorced the daughters of Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings).\" So, both of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem divorced their wives. Utaibah in particular became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso nasty in his spitefulness that one day he came before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet and said: \"I repudiate An-najmi idha haw\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Alladhi dana fatadalla\" and then he spat at him, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this spittle did not fall on him. The Holy Prophet prayed:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"O God, subject him to the power of a dog from among Your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdogs.\" Afterwards, Utaibah accompanied his father in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjourney to Syria. During the journey the caravan halted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat a place which, according to local people, was visited\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby wild beasts at night. Abu Lahab told his companions,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quraish: \"Make full arrangements for the protection\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof my son, for I fear the curse invoked by Muhammad (upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be Allah's peace) on him.\" Accordingly, the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade their camels sit all around Utaibah and went to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsleep. At night a tiger came which crossed the circle of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe camels and devoured Utaibah tearing him to pieces.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Ibn Abdul Barr: Al- Istiab; Ibn Hajar: Al-Isabah; Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNuaim al-Isfahani: Dalail an-Nubuwwat; As-Suhaili: Raud\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Unuf. Here there is a difference of opinion. Some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treporters say that the divorce took place after the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's proclamation of Prophethood and some say that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit took place after the revelation of Tabbat yada Abi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLahab. There is also a difference of opinion about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhether Abu Lahab's this son was Utbah or Utaibah. But\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis much is confirmed: that after the conquest of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah, Utbah embraced Islam and took the oath of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallegiance at the Holy Prophet's hand. Therefore, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorrect view is that it was Utaibah).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Lahab's wickedness can be judged from the fact that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen after the death of the Holy Prophet's son Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQasim, his second son, Hadrat Abdullah, also died, this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman instead of condoling with his nephew in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbereavement, hastened to the Quraish chiefs joyfully to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgive them the news that Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace and blessings) had become childless that night.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis we have already related in the commentary of Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Kauthar.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWherever the Holy Prophet went to preach his message of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam, this man followed him and forbade the people to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlisten to him. Rabiah bin Abbad ad-Dill has related: \"I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas a young boy when I accompanied my father to the face\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Dhul-Majaz. There I saw the Holy Messenger (may peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe upon him) who was exhorting the people, saying: 'O\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople, say: there is no deity but Allah, you will attain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuccess.' Following behind him I saw a man, who was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttelling the people; `This fellow is a liar: he has gone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tastray from his ancestral faith.' I asked; who is he? The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople replied: He is his uncle, Abu Lahab.\" (Musnad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad, Baihaqi). Another tradition from Hadrat Rabiah is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the effect; \"I saw that the Holy Prophet went to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thalting place of each tribe and said: `O children of so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand so, I have been appointed Allah's Messenger to you. I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texhort you to worship only Allah and to associate none\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith Him. So, affirm faith in me and join me so that I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmay fulfill the mission for which I have been sent.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFollowing close behind him there was a man who was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying: `O children of so and so, he is leading you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tastray from Lat and Uzza and inviting you to the religion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof error and innovation which he has brought. Do not at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall listen to what he says and do not follow him.' I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked my father: who is he? He replied: he is his uncle,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Lahab.\" (Musnad Ahmad, Tabarani). Tariq bin Abdullah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Muharibi's tradition is similar. He says: \"I saw in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fare of Dhul-Majaz that the Holy Messenger (upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace) was exhorting the people, saying: `O people,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay La ilaha ill-Allah, you will attain success', and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehind him there was a man who was casting stones at him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuntil his heels bled, and he was telling the people: 'Do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot listen to him, he is a liar.' I asked the people who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the was. They said he was his uncle, Abu Lahab.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Tirmidhi).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the 7th year of Prophethood, when all the clans of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraish boycotted the Bani Hashim and the Bani al-\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuttalib socially and economically, and both these clans\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremaining steadfast to the Holy Prophet's support, were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbesieged in Shib Abi Talib, Abu Lahab was the only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson, who sided with the disbelieving Quraish against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this own clan. This boycott continued for three years, so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmuch so that the Bani Hashim and the Bani al- Muttalib\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegan to starve. This, however, did not move Abu Lahab.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen a trade caravan came to Makkah and a besieged person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Shib Abi Talib approached it to buy some article of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfood, Abu Lahab would shout out to the merchants to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemand a forbidding price, telling them that he would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake up for any loss that they incurred. Thus, they would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemand exorbitant rates and the poor customer had to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn empty handed to his starving children. Then Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLahab would purchase the same articles from them at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarket rates. (Ibn Sa'd, Ibn Hisham).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn account of these very misdeeds this man was condemned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin this Surah by name, and there was a special need for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit. When the Holy Prophet's own uncle followed and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topposed him before the Arabs who came for hajj from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toutside Makkah, or gathered together in the fares held at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifferent places, they regarded it as against the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablished traditions of Arabia that an uncle should run\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown his nephew without a reason, should pelt stones at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim and bring false accusations against him publicly.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey were, therefore, influenced by what Abu Lahab said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand were involved in doubt about the Holy Prophet (upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be peace). But when this, Surah was revealed, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Lahab, filled with rage, started uttering nonsense,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people realized that what he said in opposition to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet was not at all reliable, for he said all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat in his mad hostility to his nephew.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBesides, when his uncle was condemned by name, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople's expectation that the Holy Messenger (upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace) could treat some relative leniently in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter of religion was frustrated for ever. When the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger's own uncle was taken to task publicly the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople understood that there was no room for preference\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor partiality in their faith. A non-relative could become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta near and dear one if he believed, and a near relation a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnon-relative if he disbelieved. Thus, there is no place\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the ties of blood in religion.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

(Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAdi, Baihaqi in Al-Asma was-Sifat).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn addition to these, some other traditions also have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen cited by Ibn Taimiyyali in his commentary of Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Ikhlas, which are as follows:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese traditions show that different people on different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccasions had questioned the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) about the essence and nature of the God to Whose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tservice and worship he invited the people, and on every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccasion he recited by Allah's command this very Surah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponse. First of all, the pagans. of Quraish asked him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis question in Makkah, and in reply this Surah was sent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown. Then, at Madinah, sometimes the Christians, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsometimes the other people of Arabia, asked him questions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof this nature, and every time Allah inspired him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecite this very Surah in answer to them. In each of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese traditions, it has been said that this Surah was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed on this or that occasion. From this one should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot form the impression that all these traditions are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmutually contradictory. The fact is that whenever there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texisted with the Holy Prophet a verse or a Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreviously revealed in respect of a particular question\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor matter, and later the same question was presented\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore him, Allah inspired him to recite the same verse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor Surah to the people as it contained the answer to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir question. The reporters of Hadith describe the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthing, saying: When such and such a question or matter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas presented before the Holy Prophet, such and such a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse or Surah was revealed. This has also been described\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas repetition of revelation, i.e. the revelation of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse or Surah several times.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThus, the fact is that this Surah is Makki, rather in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tview of its subject matter a Surah revealed in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearliest period at Makkah, when detailed verses of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran dealing with the essence and attributes of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAlmighty had not yet been revealed, and the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thearing, the Holy Prophet's invitation to Allah, wanted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto know what was his Lord like to whose worship and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tservice he was calling them. Another proof of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah's being one of the earliest Surahs to be revealed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis that when in Makkah Umayyah bin Khalaf, the master of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Bilal, made him lie down on burning sand and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplaced a heavy stone on his chest, Bilal used to cry\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Ahad, Ahad!\" This word was derived from this very Surah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA little consideration of the traditions regarding the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccasion of the revelation of this Surah shows what were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe religious concepts of the world at the time the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet began to preach the message of Tauhid. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tidolatrous polytheists were worshipping gods made of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twood, stone, gold, silver and other substances. These\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgods had a form, shape and body. The gods and goddesses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere descended from each other. No goddess was without a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thusband and no god without a wife. They stood in need of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfood and drink and their devotees arranged these for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem. A large number of the polytheists believed that God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassumed human form and there were some people who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescended from Him. Although the Christians claimed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve in One God, yet their God also had at least a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tson, and besides the Father and Son, the Holy Ghost also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad the honor of being an associate in Godhead: so much\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso that God had a mother and a mother-in-law too. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJews also claimed to believe in One God, but their God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoo was not without physical, material and other human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqualities and characteristics. He went for a stroll,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappeared in human form, wrestled with a servant of His,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand was father of a son, Ezra. Besides these religious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommunities, the zoroastrianism were fire worshipers, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Sabeans star worshipers. Under such conditions when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people were invited to believe in Allah, the One; Who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas no associate, it was inevitable that questions arose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the minds as to what kind of a God it was, Who was one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Only Lord and invitation to believe in Whom was being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven at the expense of all other gods and deities. It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta miracle of the Quran that in a few words briefly it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanswered all the questions and presented such a clear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcept of the Being of Allah as destroyed all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpolytheistic concepts, without leaving any room for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tascription of any of the human qualities to His Being.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Merit and Importance</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThat is why the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) held this Surah in great esteem, and he made the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims realize its importance in different ways so that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey recited it frequently and disseminated it among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople. For it states the foremost and fundamental\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoctrine of Islam (viz. Tauhid) in four such brief\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsentences as are immediately impressed on human memory\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand can be read and recited easily. There are a great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnumber of the traditions of Hadith, which show that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet on different occasions and in different ways\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttold the people that this Surah is equivalent to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone-third of the Quran. Several hadith on this subject\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been related in Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Daud; Nasai,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Musnad Ahmad, Tabarani and other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbooks, on the authority of Abu Said Khudri, Abu Hurairah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Ayyub Ansari, Abu ad-Darda, Muadh bin Jabal, Jabir\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Abdullah, Ubayy bin Kab, Umm Kulthum bint Uqbah bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbi Muait, Ibn Umar, Ibn Masud, Qatadah bin an-Numan,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnas bin Malik, and Abu Masud (may Allah be pleased with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall of them). The commentators have given many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplanations of the Holy Prophet's saying this. But in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tour opinion it simply means that the religion presented\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the Quran is based on three doctrines: Tauhid,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tApostleship and the Hereafter. This Surah teaches Tauhid,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpure and undefiled. Therefore, the Holy Prophet (upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom he Peace) regarded it as equal to one-third of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA tradition on the authority of Hadrat Aishah has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated in Bukhari, Muslim and other collections of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith, saying that the Holy Prophet sent a man as leader\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof an expedition. During the journey he concluded his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecitation of the Quran in every Prayer with Qul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHuwa-Allahu ahad. On their return him companions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned this before the Holy Prophet. He said: \"Ask him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhy he did so.\" When the man was asked, he replied: \"In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Surah the attributes of the Merciful God have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstated; therefore, I love to recite it again and again.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen the Holy Prophet heard this reply, he said to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople: \"Inform him that Allah holds him in great love\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand esteem.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA similar incident has been related in Bukhari, on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority of Hadrat Anas. He says: \"A man from among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnsar led the Prayers in the Quba Mosque. His practice\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas that in every rakah he first recited this Surah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen would join another Surah to it. The people objected\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto it and said to him: 'Don't you think that Surah Ikhlas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis by itself enough? Why do you join another Surah to it?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYou should either recite only this surah, or should leave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit and recite some other Surah'. He said: 'I cannot leave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit, I would rather give up leadership in the Prayer, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou so desired'. The people did not approve that another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman be appointed leader instead of him. At last, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter was brought before the Holy Prophet. He asked the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman, 'What prevents you from conceding what your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanions desire? What makes you recite this particular\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah in every rakah?' The man replied: 'I have great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlove for it.' The Holy Prophet remarked: 'Your this love\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor this Surah has earned you entry into Paradise'.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Imam Baihaqi in Dala'il an-Nubuwwat has written\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat these Surahs were revealed together, that is why the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcombined name of both is Mu'awwidhatayn.  We are writing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same one Introduction to both, for they discuss and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeal with just the same matters and topics.  However,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey will be explained and commented on separately below.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Period of Revelation</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Hasan Basri, 'Ikrimah, 'Ata' and Jabir bin Zaid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay that these Surahs are Makki.  A tradition from Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abdullah bin 'Abbas also supports the same view. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, according to another tradition from him, it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadani and the same view is held also by Hadrat 'Abdullah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Zubair and Qatadah.  One of the traditions which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrengthens this second view is the Hadith which Muslim,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTirmidhi, Nasa'i and Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal have related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the authority of Hadrat 'Uqbah bin 'Amir.  He says\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peach) one day said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto him:  \"Do you know what kind of verses have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed to me tonight? - these matchless verses are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq and A'udhu bi-Rabbin-nas.  This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadith is used as an argument for these Surahs to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadani because Hadrat 'Uqbah bin 'Amir had become a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim in Madinah after the hijrah, as related by Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDa'ud and Nasa'i on the basis of his own statement. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOther traditions which have lent strength to this view\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare those related by Ibn Sa'd, Muhiyy-us-Sunnah Baghawi,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tImam Nasafi, Imam Baihaqi, Hafiz Ibn Hajar, Hafiz\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBadr-uddin 'Ayni, 'Abd bin Humaid and others to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teffect that these Surahs were revealed when the Jews had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworked magic on the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah and he had fallen ill under its effect.  Ibn Sa'd\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas related on the authority of Waqidi that this happened\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin A.H. 7.  On this very basis Sufyan bin Uyainah also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas described these Surah as Madani.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut as we have explained in the Introduction to Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Ikhlas, when it is said about a certain Surah or verse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it was revealed on this or that particular occasion,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit does not necessarily mean that it was revealed for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst time on that very occasion.  Rather it sometimes so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappened that a Surah or a verse had previously been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed, then on the occurrence or appearance of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticular incident or situation, the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattention was drawn to it by Allah for the second time,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor even again and again.  In our opinion the same also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas the case with the Mu'awwidhatayn.  The subject matter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof these Surahs is explicit that these were sent down at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah in the first instance when opposition to the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet there had grown very intense.  Later, when at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah storms of opposition were raised by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites, Jews and polytheists, the Holy Prophet was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstructed to recite these very Surahs, as has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned in the above cited tradition from Hadrat Uqbah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Amir.  After this, when magic was worked on him, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this illness grew intense, Gabriel came and instructed him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Allah's command to recite these very Surahs. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, in our opinion, the view held by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentators who describe both these Surahs as Makki is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore reliable.\\tRegarding them as connected exclusively\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the incident of magic is difficult, for to this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident related only one verse (v.4), the remaining\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverses of Surah al Falaq and the whole of Surah An-Nas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave nothing to do with it directly.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject-Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe conditions under which these two Surahs were sent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown in Makkah were as follows.  As soon as the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (upon whom be peace) began to preach the message\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Islam, it seemed as though he had provoked all classes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the people around him.  As his message spread the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topposition of the disbelieving Quraish also became more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand more intense.  As long as they had any hope that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be able to prevent him from preaching his message\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby throwing some temptation in his way, or striking some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbargain with him, their hostility did not become very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactive.  But when the Holy Prophet disappointed them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompletely that he would not effect any kind of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompromise with them in the matter of faith, and in Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Kafirun they were plainly told: \"I do not worship\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who you worship nor are you worshipers of Him Whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI worship.  For you is your religion and for me is mine\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe hostility touched its extreme limits.  More\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticularly, the families whose members (men or women,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboys or girls) had accepted Islam, were burning with rage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom within against the Holy Prophet.  They were cursing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, holding secret consultations to kill him quietly in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe dark of the night so that the Bani Hashim could not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscover the murderer and take revenge; magic and charms\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere being worked on him so as to cause his death, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake him fall ill, or become mad; satans from among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen and the jinn spread on every side so as to whisper\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone or another evil into the hearts of the people against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim and the Quran brought by him so that they became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuspicious of him and fled him.  There were many people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho were burning with jealousy against him, for they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould not tolerate that a man from another family or clan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan their own should flourish and become prominent.  For\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance, the reason why Abu Jahl was crossing every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlimit in his hostility to him has been explained by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself: \"We and the Bani Abdi Manaf (to which the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet belonged) were rivals of each other: they fed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers, we too fed others; they provided conveyances to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people, we too did the same; they gave donations, we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoo gave donations, so much so that when they and we have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome equal in honor and nobility, they now proclaim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they have a Prophet who is inspired from the heaven;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thow can we compete with them in this field?  By God, we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill never acknowledge him, nor affirm faith in him\".\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Ibn Hisham, vol. I, pp. 337-338).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSuch were the conditions when the Holy Prophet (upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace) was commanded to tell the people: \"I seek\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefuge with the Lord of the dawn, from the evil of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teverything that He has created, and from the evil of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdarkness of night and from the evil of magicians, men and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen, and from the evil of the envious\", and to tell\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem: \"I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind, the King\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof mankind, and the Deity of mankind, from the evil of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe whisperer, who returns over and over again, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhispers (evil) into the hearts of men, whether he be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom among the jinn or men.\"  This is similar to what the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Moses had been told to say when Pharaoh had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpressed his design before his full court to kill him:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery arrogant person who does not believe in the Day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tReckoning.\" (Al-Mu'min: 27).  And: \"I have taken refuge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith my Lord and your Lord lest you should assail me.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Ad-Dukhan;20).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn both occasions these illustrious Prophets of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere confronted with well-equipped, resourceful and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpowerful enemies.  On both occasions they stood firm on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir message of Truth against their strong opponents,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhereas they had no material power on the strength of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich they could fight them, and on both occasions they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tutterly disregarded the threats and dangerous plans and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thostile devices of the enemy, saying: \"We have taken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefuge with the Lord of the universe against you.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tObviously, such firmness and steadfastness can be shown\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly by the person who has the conviction that the power\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof His Lord is the supreme power, that all powers of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld are insignificant against Him, and that no one can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tharm the one who has taken His refuge.\\tOnly such a one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcan say: \"I will not give up preaching the Word of Truth.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t I care the least for what you may say or do, for I have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken refuge with my Lord and your Lord and Lord of all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuniverse.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Question whether Mu&apos;awwidhatayn are, or are not, Quranic</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe above discussion is enough to help one understand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfully the theme and content of the two Surahs, but since\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree points in the books of Hadith and commentary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerning these Surahs have been discussed, which are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlikely to create doubts in the minds, it is necessary to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclear them also here.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst, whether it is absolutely established that these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo Surahs are the Quranic Surahs, or whether there is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome doubt in this regard.  This question arose because\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the traditions related from an illustrious Companion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud, it has been said that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid not regard these two Surahs as the Surahs of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran and had eliminated these from his copy of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMushaf.  Imam Ahmad, Bazzar, Tabarani, Ibn Marduyah, Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYa'la, Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal, Humaydi, Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNu'aim, Ibn Hibban and other traditionists have related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis from Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud with different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchains of transmitters and mostly on sound authority. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to these traditions, he not only eliminated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese Surahs from the Mushaf but it has also been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treported that he used to say: \"Do not mix up with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran that which is not of the Quran.  These two Surahs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare not included in the Quran.\\tThis was only a command\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoined on the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseeking God's refuge.\" In some traditions there is also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe addition that he did not recite these Surahs in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPrayer.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the basis of these traditions the opponents of Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad an opportunity to raise doubts about the Quran,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying that this Book, God forbid, is not free from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorruption.  For when, according to a Companion of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trank of Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud, these two Surahs are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan annexation to the Quran, many other additions and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubtractions also might have been made in it.  To rid the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran of this blame Qadi Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani, Qadi Iyad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand others took the stand that Ibn Mas'ud was not in fact\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta denier of the Mu'awwidhatayn being Quranic but only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefused to write them in the Mushaf.  For, according to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, only that which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) had allowed, should be written in the Mushaf, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Mas'ud did not receive the information that the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet had allowed this.  But this stand is not correct,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor according to sound evidence, it is confirmed that Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) had denied that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese were Surahs of the Quran.  Some other scholars, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance, Imam Nawawi, Imam Ibn Hazm and Imam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFakhr-udding Razi, regard this as a pure lie and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfalsehood that Ibn Mas'ud had asserted any such thing. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut to reject genuine historical facts without sound\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevidence is unscientific.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow, the question is:  How can the blame that attaches to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran because of these traditions of Ibn Mas'ud\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorrectly refuted?  This question has several answers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich we shall give below in sequence:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHafiz Bazzar after relating these traditions of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Mas'ud in his Musnad, has written that he is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsolitary and isolated in his this opinion; no one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom among the Companions has supported this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tview.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe copies of the Quran which the third Caliph,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thad got compiled by the consensus of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions and which he had sent from the Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCaliphate officially to the centers of the world\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof Islam contained both these Surahs.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Mushaf which, since the sacred time of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace) till today, has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe seal of consensus of the entire world of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam, contains both these Surahs.  The solitary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\topinion of only Abdullah bin Mas'ud, in spite of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\this high rank, has no weight against this great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconsensus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is confirmed by sound and reliable hadith from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) that he not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tonly recited these Surahs in the Prayer himself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbut instructed others also to recite them, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttaught them to the people as the Surahs of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran.\\tConsider, for instance, the following\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thadith:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWe have cited on the authority of Muslim, Ahmad, Tirmidhi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Nasai the tradition of Hadrat Uqbah bin Amir that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet told him about Surah Al-Falaq and Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn-Nas, saying that those verses had been revealed to him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat night.  A tradition in Nasai from Uqbah bin Amir is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the effect that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited both these Surahs in the Morning Prayer.  Imam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad on sound authority has related in his Musnad the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttradition from a Companion that the Holy Prophet said to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, \"When you perform the Prayer, recite both these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs in it.\"\\tIn Musnad Ahmad, Abu Daud and Nasai this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttradition of Uqbah bin Amir has been related: \"The Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet said to him: Should I not teach you two such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs as are among the best Surahs that the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecite?  He said: Do teach me, O Messenger of Allah. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThereupon the Holy Prophet taught him the Mu'awwidhatayn.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Then the Prayer began and the Holy Prophet recited the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame two Surahs in it also, and when after the Prayer the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet passed by him, he said to him, 'O Uqbah, how\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid you like it?'  Then he instructed him to the effect:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen you go to bed, and when you get up from bed, recite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese Surahs.\"\\tIn Musnad Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNasa'i there is a tradition from Uqbah bin Amir, saying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Holy Prophet exhorted him to recite the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'awwidhat (i.e. Qul Huwa Allahu ahad and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'awwidhatayn) after every Prayer.  Nasai, Ibn Marduyah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Hakim have related this tradition also from Uqbah bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmir: \"Once the Holy Prophet was riding on a conveyance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand I was walking along with him with my hand placed on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this sacred foot.  I said: Kindly teach me Surah Hud or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Yusuf.  He replied: In the sight of Allah there is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnothing more beneficial for the servant than Qul a'udhu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbi-Rabbil-falaq.\"  A tradition from Abdullah bin Abid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Juhani has been related by Nasai, Baihaqi and Ibn Sad,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying that the Holy Prophet said to him: \"Ibn Abid,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould I not tell you what are the best things out of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeans by which the seekers of refuge have sought refuge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith Allah?  I submitted: Do teach me, O Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah.\\tHe replied: Qul a'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq and Qul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta-udhu bi Rabbin-nas - both these Surahs.\"  Ibn Marduyah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad related from Hadrat Umm Salamah: \"The Surahs best\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tliked by Allah are: Qul a'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq and Qul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta'udhu bi-Rabbin-nas.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHere, the question arises: what caused Hadrat Abdullah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Mas'ud the misunderstanding that these two are not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs of the Quran?  We get the answer to it when we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcombine two traditions: first, that Hadrat Abdullah bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMas'ud asserted that this was only a command which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace) was given to teach him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe method of seeking refuge with Allah; second, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttradition which Imam Bukhari has related in his Sahih,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tImam Ahmad in his Musnad, Hafiz Abu Bakr al-Humaidi in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Musnad, Abu Nu'aim in his Al-Mustakhraj and Nasai in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Sunan, with different chains of transmitters, on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority of Zirr bin Hubaish, with a slight variation in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twording from Hadrat Ubayy bin Kab, who held a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistinguished place among the Companions on the basis of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this knowledge of the Quran.  Zirr bin Hubaish states: \"I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid to Hadrat Ubayy: Your brother, Abdullah bin Mas'ud,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsays these things.  What do you say about this view?  He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied: I had questioned the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) about this.  He said to me: I was told to say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'qul', so I said 'qul'.  Therefore, we too say the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas the Holy Prophet said.\"  In the tradition related by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tImam Ahmad, Hadrat Ubayy's words are to the effect: \"I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbear witness that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttold me that Gabriel (peace be on him) had told him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay: Qul a'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq; therefore, he recited\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlikewise, and Gabriel asked him to say: Qul a'udhu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbi-Rabbin-nas; therefore he too said likewise.\\tHence, we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoo say as the Holy Prophet said.\"  A little\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsideration of these two traditions will show that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tword qul (say) in the two Surahs caused Hadrat Abdullah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Mas'ud the misunderstanding that the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) had been commanded to say: A'udhu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbi-Rabbil-falaq and A'udhu bi-Rabbin-nas.  But he did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfeel any need to question the Holy Prophet about it.  In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mind of Hadrat Ubbay bin Kab also a question arose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout his and he put it before the Holy Prophet.  The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet replied: \"Since Gabriel (peace be on him)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad said qul, so I too say qul.\"  Let us put it like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis.  If somebody is commanded and asked: \"Say, I seek\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefuge\", he will not carry out the command, saying: \"Say,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI seek refuge\", but he will drop the word \"say\" and say:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"I seek refuge.\"  On the contrary, if the messenger of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuperior officer conveys to somebody the message in these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords: \"Say, I seek refuge\", and this command is given to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim not only for his own person but to be conveyed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers, he will convey the words of the message verbatim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the people, and will not have the permission to drop\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything from the text of the message.\\tThus, the fact\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat these two Surahs begin with the word qul is a clear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproof that it is Divine Word, which the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) was bound to convey verbatim.  It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas not merely a command given to him for his person. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBesides these two Surahs, there are 330 other verses in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran which begin with the word qul (say).\\tThe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresence of qul in all these is a proof that it is Divine\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWord. which was obligatory for the Holy Prophet to convey\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverbatim; otherwise if qul everywhere had meant a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommand, the Holy Prophet would have dropped it and said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly that which he was commanded to say, and it would not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been recorded in the Quran, but, on the contrary, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould have remained content with saying only what he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommanded to say.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHere, if one considers this, one can understand fully\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell how unreasonable it is to regard the Companions as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinfallible and to make the clamor that a Companion has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen defamed as soon as one hears a saying or doing of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this being described as wrong.  Here, one can clearly see\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat a blunder happened to be committed by an illustrious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanion like Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud about two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs of the Quran.  If such an error could be committed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby an eminent Companion like him, others also might\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommit an error.  We can examine it in the scientific\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tway, and describe it as wrong if a thing said or done by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta Companion is proved to be wrong.  But wicked indeed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be the person who went beyond describing a wrong\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tact as wrong and started reproving and finding fault with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Companions of the Holy Prophet of Allah.  Concerning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Mu'awwidhatayn the commentators and traditionists\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave described the opinion of Ibn Mas'ud as wrong, but no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone has dared to say that by denying these two Surahs of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran, he had, God forbid, become a disbeliever.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Question of Holy Prophet&apos;s being affected by Magic</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe second thing that has arisen in respect of these two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs is that, according to traditions, magic had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworked on the Holy Prophet, and he had fallen ill under\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits effect, and Gabriel (peace be on him) had instructed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim to repeat these Surahs to remove the charm.  This has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen objected to by many rationalists of both ancient and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmodern times.  They say that if these traditions are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccepted, the whole Shari'ah becomes doubtful.\\tFor if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet could be charmed, and according to these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditions he was charmed, one cannot say what the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet might have been made to say and do under the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinfluence of magic by his opponents, and what in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteaching may be Divine and what the result of magic.  Not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly this: they also allege that if this is accepted as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrue, it might well be that the Prophet might have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprompted to make the claim to Prophethood through magic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Prophet by misunderstanding might have thought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat an angel had come to him.\\tThey also argue that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese traditions clash with the Quran.\\tThe Quran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentions the accusation of the disbelievers who said that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet was bewitched (Bani Israel:47), but these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditions confirm the accusation of the disbelievers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Prophet had actually been charmed and bewitched.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor a proper investigation of this question it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary that one should first see whether it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablished by authentic historical evidence that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace) had actually been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffected by magic, and if so, what it was and to what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textent.  Then it should be seen whether the objections\\n\\t\\t\\t\\traised against what is established historically do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactually apply to it or not.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Muslim scholars of the earliest period were truly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thonest and upright in that they did not try to corrupt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory or conceal facts according to their own ideas,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcepts and assumptions.  They conveyed intact to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlater generations whatever was confirmed historically,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand did not at all care how the material supplied by them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould be used by the one who was bent upon drawing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperverse conclusions from the facts.  Now, if something\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstands confirmed by authentic and historical means, it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneither right for an honest and rightminded person that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the should deny history on the ground that in case he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccepted it, it would lead to these evil results\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to his thinking, nor it is right that he should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadd to and stretch beyond its genuine limits by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconjecture and speculation whatever is established\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistorically.  Instead, he should accept history as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory and then see what is actually proved by it and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat is not.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs far as the historical aspect is concerned, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident of the Holy Prophet's being affected by magic is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsolutely confirmed, and if it can be refuted by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscientific criticism, then no historical event of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld can be proved right and genuine.\\tIt has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated by Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Imam Ahmad,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdur Razzaq, Humaidi, Baihaqi, Tabarani, Ibn Sad, Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMardayah, Ibn Abi Shaibah, Hakim, Abd bin Humaid and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother traditionists on the authority of Hadrat Aishah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Zaid bin Arqam and Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough so many different and numerous channels that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforgery is out of the question.  Although each tradition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby itself is an isolated report (khabar wahid), we give\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit below as a connected event from the details provided\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the traditions.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter the peace treaty of Hudaibiyah when the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (upon whom be peace) returned to Madinah, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeputation of the Jews of Khaiber visited Madinah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuharram, A.H. 7 and met a famous magician, Labid bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAsam, who belonged to the Ansar tribe of Bani Zurayq. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey said to him: \"You know how Muhammad (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace and blessings) has treated us.  We have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttried our best to bewitch him but have not succeeded. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow we have come to you because you are a more skilled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmagician.  Here are three gold coins, accept these and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcast a powerful magic spell on Muhammad.\"  In those days\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet had a Jewish boy as his attendant. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThrough him they obtained a piece of the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomb with some hair stuck to it.  Magic was worked on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame hair and the teeth of the comb.  According to some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditions, magic was worked by Labid bin Asam himself;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to others, his sisters were more skilled than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim and he got the spell cast through them.  Whatever be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe case, Labid placed this spell in the spathe of a male\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdate-tree and his it under a stone at the bottom of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDharwan or Dhi Arwan, the well of Bani Zurayq.\\tThe spell\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttook one whole year to have effect upon the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace).  In the latter half of the year the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet started feeling as if was unwell.\\tThe last\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforty days became hard on him, of which the last three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays were even harder.\\tBut its maximum effect on him was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he way melting away from within.  He thought he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdone a thing whereas, in fact, he had not done it: he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthought he had visited his wives whereas he had not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvisited them; and sometimes he would doubt having seen\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething whereas, in fact, he had not seen it.  All\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese effects were confined to his own person; so much so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the other people could not notice what state he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassing through.  As for his being a Prophet, no change\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurred in the performance of his duties.  There is no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttradition to say that he might have forgotten some verses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Quran in those days, or might have recited a verse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrongly, or a change might have occurred in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassemblies and in his counsels and sermons, or he might\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave presented a discourse as Revelation which may not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been revealed to him, or he might have missed a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPrayer and thought that he had performed it.  God forbid,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif any such thing had happened, it would have caused a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclamor and the whole of Arabia would have known that a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmagician had overpowered the one whom no power had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\table to overpower.  But the Holy Prophet's position as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet remained wholly unaffected by it.  Only in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonal life he remained worried on account of it.  At\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlast, one day when he was in the house of Hadrat Aishah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the prayed to Allah to be restored to full health.  In the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeantime he fell asleep or drowsed and on waking he said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Hadrat Aishah: \"My Lord has told me what I had asked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Him.\"  Hadrat Aishah asked what it was.  He replied:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Two men (i.e. two angels in human guise) came to me. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOne sat near my head and the other near my feet.  The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst asked: what has happened to him?\\tThe other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied: Magic has been worked on him.\\tThe first asked:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho has worked it?  He replied: Labid bin Asam.  He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked: In what is it contained?  He replied: In the comb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand hair covered in the spathe of a male date-tree.  He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked: where is it?  He replied: under a stone at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbottom of Dhi Arwan (or Dharwan), the well of Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZurayq.  He asked: what should be done about it?  He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied: the well should be emptied and it should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken out from under the stone.  The Holy Prophet then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsent Hadrat Ali, Hadrat Ammar bin Yasir and Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZubair: They were also joined by Jubair bin Iyas az-Zurqi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(two men from Bani Zurayq).  Later the Holy Prophet also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarrived at the well along with some Companions.  The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twater was taken out and the spathe recovered.  There they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfound that beside the comb and hair there was a cord with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\televen knots on it and a wax image with needles pricked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto it.  Gabriel (peace be on him) came and told him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepeat the Mu'awwidhatayn.  As he repeated verse after \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse, a knot was loosened and a needle taken out every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime, till on finishing the last words all the knots were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tloosened and all the needles removed, and he was entirely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfreed from the charm.  After this he called Labid and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestioned him.  He confessed his guilt and the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet let him go, for he never avenged himself on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanyone for any harm done to his person.  He even declined\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto talk about it to others, saying that Allah had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trestored him to health; therefore he did not like that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould incite the people against anyone.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is the story of the magic worked on the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet.  There is nothing in it which might run counter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto his office of Prophethood.  In his personal capacity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif any injury could be inflicted on him as it happened in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Battle of Uhud, if he could fall from his horse and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe hurt as is confirmed by the Hadith, if he could be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstung by a scorpion as has been mentioned in some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTraditions and none of these negates the protection\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpromised him by Allah in his capacity as a Prophet, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould also fall ill under the influence of magic in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonal capacity.  That a Prophet can be affected by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmagic is also confirmed by the Quran.  In Surah Al-A'raf\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit has been said about the magicians of Pharaoh that when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey confronted the Prophet Moses, they bewitched the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teyes of thousands of people who had assembled to witness\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe encounter (v. 116).  In Surah Ta Ha it has been said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat not only the common people but the Prophet Moses too\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfelt that the cords and staffs that they cast were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trunning towards them like so many snakes, and this filled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMoses' heart with fear.  Thereupon Allah revealed to him:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Don't fear for you will come out victorious.  Cast down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou staff.\" (vv. 66-69).  As for the objection that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen confirms the accusation of the disbelievers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbewitched man, its answer is that the disbelievers did\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot call him a bewitched man in the sense that he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfallen ill under that effect of magic cast by somebody,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut in the sense that some magician has, God forbid, made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim mad, and he had made claim to Prophethood and was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttelling the people tales of Hell and Heaven in his same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmadness.  Now, obviously this objection does not at all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapply to a matter about which history confirms that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmagic spell had affected only the person of Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) and not the Prophethood of Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace), which remained wholly unaffected by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this connection, another thing worthy of mention is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the people who regard magic as a kind of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuperstition hold this view only because the effect of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmagic cannot be explained scientifically.  But there are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmany things in the world which one experiences and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobserves but one cannot explain scientifically how they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappen.  If we cannot give any such explanation it does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot become necessary that we should deny the thing itself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich we cannot explain.  Magic, in fact, is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpsychological phenomenon which can affect the body\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough the mind just as physical things affect the mind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough the body.  Fear, for instance, is a psychological\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tphenomenon, but it affects the body: the hair stand on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tend and the body shudders.  Magic does not; in fact,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchange the reality, but under its influence man's mind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand senses start feeling as if reality had changed.  The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstaffs and the cords that the magicians had thrown\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttowards the Prophet Moses, had not actually become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsnakes, but the eyes of the multitude of people were so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbewitched that everybody felt they were snakes; even the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsenses of the Prophet Moses could not remain unaffected\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the magic spell.  Likewise, in Al-Baqarah: 102, it has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen said that in Babylon people learnt such matic from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHarut and Marut as could cause division between husband\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand wife.  This too was a psychological phenomenon. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tObviously, if the people did not find it officacious by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texperience they could not become its customers.  No\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoubt, it is correct that just like the bullet of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trifle and the bomb from the aircraft, magic too cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave effect without Allah's permission, but it would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmere stubbornness to deny a thing which has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texperienced and observed by man for thousands for years.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Question of Reciting Charms and Amulets in Islam</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe third thing that arises in connection with these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs is whether recitation of charms and amulets has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany place in Islam, and whether such recitation is by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\titself efficacious or not.  This question arises for in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmany hadith it has been reported that the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) at the time of going to bed every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnight, especially during illness, used to recite the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'awwidhatayn (or according to other reports, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'awwidhat, i.e. Qul Huwa-Allahu Ahad and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'awwidhatayn) thrice, blow in his hands and then rub\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe hands on his body from head to foot as far as his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thands could reach.  During his last illness when it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot longer possible for him to so do, Hadrat Aishah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited these Surahs herself or by his command blew on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this hands hin view of their being blessed and rubbed them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton his body.  Traditions on this subject have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated in Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Abu Da'ud\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Mu'atta of Imam Malik through authentic channels on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe authority of Hadrat Aishah herself beside whom no one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould be better acquainted with the domestic life of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this regard, one should first understand its religious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taspect.  In the Hadith a lengthy tradition has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated on the authority of Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas, at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe end of which the Holy Prophet is reported to have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: \"The people of my Ummah to enter Paradise without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treckoning will be those who neither turn to treatment by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbranding, nor to enchanting, nor take omens, but have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrust in their Lord.\" (Muslim).  According to a tradition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treported on the authority of Hadrat Mughirah bin Shubah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet said: \"He who got himself treated by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbranding, or enchanting, became independent of trust in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah.\" (Tirmidhi).  Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treported that the Holy Prophet disapproved of ten things\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone of which was recitation of charms and amulets except\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby means of the Mu'awwidhatayn or Mu'awwidhat.\\t(Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDaud, Ahmad, Nasai, Ibn Hibban, Hakim).  Some hadith also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshow that in the beginning the Holy Prophet had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taltogether forbidden recitation of charms and amulets,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut later he allowed it on the condition that is should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot smack of polytheism, but one should recite and blow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby means of the holy names of Allah, or the words of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran.\\tThe words used should be understandable and one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould know that there is nothing sinful in it, and one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould not wholly rely on the recitation of charms but on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's will to make it beneficial.\"  After the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplanation of the religious aspect, let us now see what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hadith says in this regard.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTabarani in As-Saghir has related a tradition on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority of Hadrat Ali, saying: \"Once the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas stung by a scorpion during the Prayer.  When the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPrayer was over, he remarked: God's curse be on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscorpion: it neither spares a praying one, nor any other.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Then he called for water and salt, and started rubbing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe place where the scorpion had stung with salt water\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand reciting Qul ya ayyuhal-kafirun, Qul Huwa Allahu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tahad, Qul a'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq and Qul a'udhu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbi-Rabbin-nas, along with it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Abbas also has related a tradition to the effect:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) used to recite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis invocation over Hadrat Hasan and Husain: U'idhu kuma\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbi-kalimat Allahit-tamati min kulli shaitan-in wa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thammati-wa min kulli ayt-in-lam nati: \"I give you in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefuge of Allah's blameless words, from every devil and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttroublesome thing, and from every evil look.\" (Bukhari,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMusnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA tradition has been related in Muslim, Muwatta, Tabarani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Hakim about Uthman bin al-As ath-Thaqafi, with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlittle variation in wording, to the effect that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplained to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying: \"Since I have become a Muslim, I feel a pain in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmy body, which is killing me.\"\\tThe Holy Prophet said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Place your right hand on the place where you feel the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpain, then recite Bismillah thrice, and A'udhu billahi wa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqudratihi min sharri ma ajidu wa uhadhiru (\"I seek refuge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith Allah and with His power from the evil that I find\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand that I fear\") seven times, and rub your hand.\"  In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuwatta there is the addition: \"Uthman bin Abi al-As\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: After that my pain disappeared and now I teach the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame formula to the people of my house.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMusnad Ahmad and Tahavi contain this tradition from Talq\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Ali: \"I was stung by a scorpion in the presence of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace).\\tThe Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited something and blew over me and rubbed his hand on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe affected place.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim contains a tradition from Abu Said Khudri, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsays: \"Once when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfell ill, Gabriel came and asked: O Muhammad, are you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\till?  The Holy Prophet answered in the affirmative. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGabriel said: I blow on you in the name of Allah from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teverything which troubles you and from the evil of every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsoul and the evil look of every envier.  May Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trestore you to health.\\tI blow on you in His name.\"  A\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimilar tradition has been related in Musnad Ahmad on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority of Hadrat Ubadah bin as-Samit, which says: \"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet was unwell.  I went to visit him and found\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim in great trouble.  When I re-visited him in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevening I found him quite well.  When I asked how he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome well so soon, he said: Gabriel came and blew over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tme with some words.  Then he recited words similar to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose reported in the above Hadith.  A tradition similar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto this has been related on the authority of Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAishah also in Muslim and Musnad Ahmad.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tImam Ahmad in his Musnad has related this tradition from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHafsah, mother of the Faithful: \"One day the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) visited me in the house and a woman,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnamed Shifa, was sitting with me.  She used to blow on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people to cure them of blisters.  The Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid to her: Teach Hafsah also the formula.\"  Imam Ahmad,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Daud and Nasai have related this tradition from Shifa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbint Abdullah herself, saying: \"The Holy Prophet said to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tme: Just as you have taught Hafsah reading and writing,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso teach her blowing to cure blisters as well.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Muslim there is a tradition from Auf bin Malik\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Ashjal to the effect: \"We used to practice blowing to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcure diseases.\\tWe asked the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) for his opinion in this regard.\\tHe said: Let me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknow the words with which you blow over the people. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere is no harm in blowing unless it smacks of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpolytheism.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim, Musnad Ahmad and Ibn Majah contain a tradition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Hadrat Jabir bin Abdullah, saying: \"The Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) had forbidden us blowing to cure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisease.  Then the people of the clan of Hadrat Amr bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHazm came and they said: We had a formula with which we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tused to blow on the people to cure them of scorpion's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsting (or snake-bite).\\tBut you have forbidden us the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice.  Then they recited before him the words which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey made use of.  Thereupon the Holy Prophet said: I do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot see any harm in it, so let the one who can do good to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this brother, do him good.\"  Another tradition from Jabir\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Abdullah in Muslim is: \"The family of Hazm had a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformula to cure snake-bite and the Holy Prophet permitted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem to practice it.\"  This is also supported by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttradition from Hadrat Aishah, which is contained in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim, Musnad Ahmad, and Ibn Majah: \"The Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgranted permission to a family of the Ansar for blowing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto cure the evils effects of biting by every poisonous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreature.\"  Traditions resembling these have been related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Hadrat Anas also in Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Ibn Majah, saying that the Holy Prophet gave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermission for blowing to cure the bite by poisonous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreatures, the disease of blisters and the effects of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevil look.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMusnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Hakim have related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis tradition on the authority of Hadrat Umair, freed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave of Abi al-Laham: \"In the pre-Islamic days I had a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformula with which I used to blow over the people.  I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited it before the Holy Prophet, whereupon he told me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto drop out such and such words from it, and permitted me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto blow with the rest of it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to Muwatta, Hadrat Abu Bakr went to the house\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his daughter, Hadrat Aishah, and found that she was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunwell and a Jewish woman was blowing over her. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThereupon he said to her: \"Blow over her by means of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBook of Allah.\"  This shows that if the people of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBook practice blowing by means of the verses of the Torah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Gospel, it is also permitted.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs for the question whether blowing for curing disease is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tefficacious also, or not, its answer is that the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (upon whom be peace) not only did not forbid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanybody to have recourse to cure and medical treatment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut himself stated that Allah has created a cure for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery disease and exhorted his followers to use cures. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe himself told the people remedies for certain diseases,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas can be seen in the Hadith in the Kitab at-Tib (Book of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCures).  But the cure can be beneficial and useful only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Allah's command and permission, otherwise if the cure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand medical treatment were beneficial in every case, no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone would have died in hospitals.  Now, if beside the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcure and medical treatment, Allah's Word and His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeautiful names also are made use of, or Word and His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeautiful names also are made use of, or Allah is turned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto and invoked for help by means of His Word, Names and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAttributes in a place where no medical aid is available,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit would not be against reason except for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaterialists.  However, it is not right to disregard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintentionally a cure or treatment where it is available,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand recourse had only to enchanting and reciting of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharms, and the people should start a regular practice of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgranting amulets as a means of earning their livelihood.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMany people in this regard argue from Hadrat Abu Said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhudri's tradition which has been related in Bukhari,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim, Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad, Abu Daud and Ibn Majah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand it is supported also by a tradition related in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBukhari on the authority of Ibn Abbas.\\tAccording to it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet sent some of his Companions including\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Abu Said Khudri on an expedition.  They halted on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe way at the settlement of an Arabian tribe and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemanded hospitality from the people, but they refused to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textend any hospitality.  In the meantime the chief of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribe was stung by a scorpion and the people came to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttravelers to ask if they had any medicine or formula by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich their chief could be cured.  Hadrat Abu Said said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Yes, we do have, but since you have refused us\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thospitality, we would not treat him unless you promised\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tus to give us something.\"  They promised to give them a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflock of goats (according to some traditions, 30 goats),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Hadrat Abu Said went and started reciting Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Fatihah and rubbing his saliva on the affected place. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConsequently, the chief felt relieved of the effect of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe poison and the people of the tribe gave them the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoats as promised.  But the Companions said to one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother; \"Let us not make any use of the goats until we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave asked the Holy Prophet about it\", for they were not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsure whether it was permissible to accept any reward for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat they had done.  So they came before the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand related what had happened.\\tThe Holy Prophet smiled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand said: \"How did you know that Surah Al-Fatihah could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso be used for curing such troubles?\\tTake the goats\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand allocate my share also in it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut before one used this Hadith for permission to adopt a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregular profession of granting amulets and reciting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharms, one should keep in view the conditions under\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich Hadrat Abu Said Khudri had recourse to it, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet not only held it as permissible but also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid that a share for him also should be allocated so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat there remained no doubt in the minds of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions that such a thing was permissible.  The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions in Arabia in those days were, as they still\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare, that settlements were situated hundreds of miles\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapart, there were not hotels and restaurants where a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraveler could buy food when he reached one of these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter several days' journey.  Under such conditions it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas considered a moral duty that when a traveler reached\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta settlement the people of the place should extend\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thospitality to him.  Refusal on their part in many cases\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeant death for the travelers, and this was looked upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas highly blameworthy among the Arabs.\\tThat is why the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace) allowed as permissible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe act of his Companions.  Since the people of the tribe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad refused them hospitality, they too refused to treat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir chief, and became ready to treat him only on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition that they should promise to give them something\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin return.  Then, when one of them with trust in God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited Surah Al-Fatihah over the chief and he became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell, the people gave the promised wages and the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet allowed that the wages be accepted as lawful and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpure.  In Bukhari the tradition related on the authority\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas about this incident contains\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet's words to the effect: \"Instead that you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould have acted otherwise, it was better that you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited the Book of Allah and accepted the wages for it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t He said this in order to impress the truth that Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWord is superior to every other kind of enchanting and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice of secret arts.  Furthermore, the Message also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas incidentally conveyed to the Arabian tribe and its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople made aware of the blessings of the Word that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace) had brought from Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t This incident cannot be cited as a precedent for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople who run clinic in the cities and towns for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice of secret arts and have adopted it as a regular\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprofession for earning livelihood.  No precedent of it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfound in the life and practice of the Holy Prophet (upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be peace) or his Companions, their followers and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearliest Imams.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Relation between Surah Al-Fatihah and the Mu&apos;awwidhatayn</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe last thing which is noteworthy with regard to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'awwidhatayn is the relation between the beginning and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe end of the Quran.  Although the Quran has not been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarranged chronologically, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) arranged in the present order the verses and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs revealed during 23 years on different occasions to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeet different needs and situations not by himself but by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe command of Allah Who reveled them.\\tAccording to this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torder, the Quran opens with the Surah Al-Fatihah and ends\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the Mu'awwidhatayn.  Now, let us have a look at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo.  In the beginning, after praising and glorifying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, Who is Lord of the worlds, Kind, Merciful and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMaster of the Judgment Day, the servant submits: \"Lord,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYou alone I worship and to You alone I turn for help, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe most urgent help that I need from You is to be guided\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Straight Way.\"  In answer, he is given by Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe whole Quran to show him the Straight Way, which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcluded thus: Man prays to Allah, Who is Lord of dawn,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLord of men, King of men, Deity of men, saying: \"I seek\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefuge only with You for protection from every evil and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmischief of every creature, and in particular, from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevil whisperings of devils, be they from among men or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjinn, for they are the greatest obstacle in following the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tStraight Way.\"\\tThe relation that the beginning bears\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the end, cannot remain hidden from anyone who has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstanding and insight.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"

Imam Baihaqi in Dala'il an-Nubuwwat has written\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat these Surahs were revealed together, that is why the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcombined name of both is Mu'awwidhatayn.  We are writing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same one Introduction to both, for they discuss and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeal with just the same matters and topics.  However,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey will be explained and commented on separately below.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Period of Revelation</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Hasan Basri, 'Ikrimah, 'Ata' and Jabir bin Zaid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay that these Surahs are Makki.  A tradition from Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abdullah bin 'Abbas also supports the same view. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, according to another tradition from him, it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadani and the same view is held also by Hadrat 'Abdullah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Zubair and Qatadah.  One of the traditions which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrengthens this second view is the Hadith which Muslim,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTirmidhi, Nasa'i and Imam Ahmad bin Handball have related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the authority of Hadrat 'Uqbah bin 'Amir.  He says\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peach) one day said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto him:  \"Do you know what kind of verses have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed to me tonight? - these matchless verses are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq and A'udhu bi-Rabbin-nas.  This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadith is used as an argument for these Surahs to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadani because Hadrat 'Uqbah bin 'Amir had become a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim in Madinah after the hijrah, as related by Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDa'ud and Nasa'i on the basis of his own statement. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOther traditions which have lent strength to this view\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare those related by Ibn Sa'd, Muhiyy-us-Sunnah Baghawi,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tImam Nasafi, Imam Baihaqi, Hafiz Ibn Hajar, Hafiz\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBadr-uddin 'Ayni, 'Abd bin Humaid and others to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teffect that these Surahs were revealed when the Jews had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworked magic on the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah and he had fallen ill under its effect.  Ibn Sa'd\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas related on the authority of Waqidi that this happened\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin A.H. 7.  On this very basis Sufyan bin Uyainah also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas described these Surah as Madani.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut as we have explained in the Introduction to Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Ikhlas, when it is said about a certain Surah or verse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it was revealed on this or that particular occasion,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit does not necessarily mean that it was revealed for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst time on that very occasion.  Rather it sometimes so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappened that a Surah or a verse had previously been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed, then on the occurrence or appearance of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticular incident or situation, the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattention was drawn to it by Allah for the second time,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor even again and again.  In our opinion the same also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas the case with the Mu'awwidhatayn.  The subject matter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof these Surahs is explicit that these were sent down at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah in the first instance when opposition to the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet there had grown very intense.  Later, when at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah storms of opposition were raised by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrites, Jews and polytheists, the Holy Prophet was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstructed to recite these very Surahs, as has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned in the above cited tradition from Hadrat Uqbah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Amir.  After this, when magic was worked on him, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this illness grew intense, Gabriel came and instructed him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Allah's command to recite these very Surahs. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, in our opinion, the view held by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentators who describe both these Surahs as Makki is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore reliable.\\tRegarding them as connected exclusively\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the incident of magic is difficult, for to this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident related only one verse (v.4), the remaining\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverses of Surah al Falaq and the whole of Surah An-Nas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave nothing to do with it directly.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Theme and Subject-Matter</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe conditions under which these two Surahs were sent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown in Makkah were as follows.  As soon as the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (upon whom be peace) began to preach the message\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Islam, it seemed as though he had provoked all classes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the people around him.  As his message spread the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topposition of the disbelieving Quraish also became more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand more intense.  As long as they had any hope that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be able to prevent him from preaching his message\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby throwing some temptation in his way, or striking some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbargain with him, their hostility did not become very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactive.  But when the Holy Prophet disappointed them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompletely that he would not effect any kind of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompromise with them in the matter of faith, and in Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Kafirun they were plainly told: \"I do not worship\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who you worship nor are you worshipers of Him Whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI worship.  For you is your religion and for me is mine\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe hostility touched its extreme limits.  More\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticularly, the families whose members (men or women,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboys or girls) had accepted Islam, were burning with rage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom within against the Holy Prophet.  They were cursing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, holding secret consultations to kill him quietly in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe dark of the night so that the Bani Hashim could not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscover the murderer and take revenge; magic and charms\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere being worked on him so as to cause his death, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake him fall ill, or become mad; satans from among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen and the jinn spread on every side so as to whisper\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone or another evil into the hearts of the people against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim and the Quran brought by him so that they became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuspicious of him and fled him.  There were many people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho were burning with jealousy against him, for they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould not tolerate that a man from another family or clan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan their own should flourish and become prominent.  For\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance, the reason why Abu Jahl was crossing every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlimit in his hostility to him has been explained by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself: \"We and the Bani Abdi Manaf (to which the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet belonged) were rivals of each other: they fed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers, we too fed others; they provided conveyances to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people, we too did the same; they gave donations, we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoo gave donations, so much so that when they and we have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome equal in honor and nobility, they now proclaim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they have a Prophet who is inspired from the heaven;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thow can we compete with them in this field?  By God, we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill never acknowledge him, nor affirm faith in him\".\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Ibn Hisham, vol. I, pp. 337-338).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSuch were the conditions when the Holy Prophet (upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace) was commanded to tell the people: \"I seek\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefuge with the Lord of the dawn, from the evil of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teverything that He has created, and from the evil of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdarkness of night and from the evil of magicians, men and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen, and from the evil of the envious\", and to tell\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem: \"I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind, the King\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof mankind, and the Deity of mankind, from the evil of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe whisperer, who returns over and over again, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhispers (evil) into the hearts of men, whether he be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom among the jinn or men.\"  This is similar to what the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet Moses had been told to say when Pharaoh had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpressed his design before his full court to kill him:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery arrogant person who does not believe in the Day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tReckoning.\" (Al-Mu'min: 27).  And: \"I have taken refuge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith my Lord and your Lord lest you should assail me.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Ad-Dukhan;20).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn both occasions these illustrious Prophets of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere confronted with well-equipped, resourceful and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpowerful enemies.  On both occasions they stood firm on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir message of Truth against their strong opponents,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhereas they had no material power on the strength of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich they could fight them, and on both occasions they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tutterly disregarded the threats and dangerous plans and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thostile devices of the enemy, saying: \"We have taken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefuge with the Lord of the universe against you.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tObviously, such firmness and steadfastness can be shown\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly by the person who has the conviction that the power\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof His Lord is the supreme power, that all powers of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld are insignificant against Him, and that no one can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tharm the one who has taken His refuge.\\tOnly such a one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcan say: \"I will not give up preaching the Word of Truth.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t I care the least for what you may say or do, for I have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken refuge with my Lord and your Lord and Lord of all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuniverse.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Question whether Mu&apos;awwidhatayn are, or are not, Quranic</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe above discussion is enough to help one understand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfully the theme and content of the two Surahs, but since\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree points in the books of Hadith and commentary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerning these Surahs have been discussed, which are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlikely to create doubts in the minds, it is necessary to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclear them also here.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFirst, whether it is absolutely established that these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo Surahs are the Quranic Surahs, or whether there is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome doubt in this regard.  This question arose because\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the traditions related from an illustrious Companion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud, it has been said that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid not regard these two Surahs as the Surahs of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran and had eliminated these from his copy of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMushaf.  Imam Ahmad, Bazzar, Tabarani, Ibn Marduyah, Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYa'la, Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal, Humaydi, Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNu'aim, Ibn Hibban and other traditionists have related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis from Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud with different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchains of transmitters and mostly on sound authority. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to these traditions, he not only eliminated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese Surahs from the Mushaf but it has also been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treported that he used to say: \"Do not mix up with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran that which is not of the Quran.  These two Surahs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare not included in the Quran.\\tThis was only a command\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoined on the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseeking God's refuge.\" In some traditions there is also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe addition that he did not recite these Surahs in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPrayer.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the basis of these traditions the opponents of Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad an opportunity to raise doubts about the Quran,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying that this Book, God forbid, is not free from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorruption.  For when, according to a Companion of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trank of Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud, these two Surahs are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan annexation to the Quran, many other additions and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubtractions also might have been made in it.  To rid the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran of this blame Qadi Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani, Qadi Iyad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand others took the stand that Ibn Mas'ud was not in fact\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta denier of the Mu'awwidhatayn being Qur'anic but only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefused to write them in the Mushaf.  For, according to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, only that which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) had allowed, should be written in the Mushaf, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Mas'ud did not receive the information that the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet had allowed this.  But this stand is not correct,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor according to sound evidence, it is confirmed that Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) had denied that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese were Surahs of the Quran.  Some other scholars, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance, Imam Nawawi, Imam Ibn Hazm and Imam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFakhr-udding Razi, regard this as a pure lie and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfalsehood that Ibn Mas'ud had asserted any such thing. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut to reject genuine historical facts without sound\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevidence is unscientific.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow, the question is:  How can the blame that attaches to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran because of these traditions of Ibn Mas'ud\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorrectly refuted?

A tradition in Nasai from Uqbah bin Amir is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the effect that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited both these Surahs in the Morning Prayer.  Imam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad on sound authority has related in his Musnad the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttradition from a Companion that the Holy Prophet said to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, \"When you perform the Prayer, recite both these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs in it.\"\\tIn Musnad Ahmad, Abu Daud and Nasai this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttradition of Uqbah bin Amir has been related: \"The Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet said to him: Should I not teach you two such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs as are among the best Surahs that the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecite?  He said: Do teach me, O Messenger of Allah. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThereupon the Holy Prophet taught him the Mu'awwidhatayn.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Then the Prayer began and the Holy Prophet recited the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame two Surahs in it also, and when after the Prayer the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet passed by him, he said to him, 'O Uqbah, how\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid you like it?'  Then he instructed him to the effect:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen you go to bed, and when you get up from bed, recite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese Surahs.\"\\tIn Musnad Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNasa'i there is a tradition from Uqbah bin Amir, saying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Holy Prophet exhorted him to recite the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'awwidhat (i.e. Qul Huwa Allahu ahad and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'awwidhatayn) after every Prayer.

We get the answer to it when we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcombine two traditions: first, that Hadrat Abdullah bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMas'ud asserted that this was only a command which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace) was given to teach him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe method of seeking refuge with Allah; second, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttradition which Imam Bukhari has related in his Sahih,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tImam Ahmad in his Musnad, Hafiz Abu Bakr al-Humaidi in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Musnad, Abu Nu'aim in his Al-Mustakhraj and Nasai in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Sunan, with different chains of transmitters, on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority of Zirr bin Hubaish, with a slight variation in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twording from Hadrat Ubayy bin Kab, who held a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistinguished place among the Companions on the basis of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this knowledge of the Quran.  Zirr bin Hubaish states: \"I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid to Hadrat Ubayy: Your brother, Abdullah bin Mas'ud,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsays these things.  What do you say about this view?  He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied: I had questioned the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) about this.  He said to me: I was told to say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'qul', so I said 'qul'.  Therefore, we too say the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas the Holy Prophet said.\"  In the tradition related by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tImam Ahmad, Hadrat Ubayy's words are to the effect: \"I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbear witness that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttold me that Gabriel (peace be on him) had told him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay: Qul a'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq; therefore, he recited\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlikewise, and Gabriel asked him to say: Qul a'udhu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbi-Rabbin-nas; therefore he too said likewise.\\tHence, we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoo say as the Holy Prophet said.\"  A little\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsideration of these two traditions will show that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tword qul (say) in the two Surahs caused Hadrat Abdullah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Mas'ud the misunderstanding that the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) had been commanded to say: A'udhu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbi-Rabbil-falaq and A'udhu bi-Rabbin-nas.  But he did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfeel any need to question the Holy Prophet about it.  In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mind of Hadrat Ubbay bin Kab also a question arose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout his and he put it before the Holy Prophet.  The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet replied: \"Since Gabriel (peace be on him)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad said qul, so I too say qul.\"  Let us put it like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis.  If somebody is commanded and asked: \"Say, I seek\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefuge\", he will not carry out the command, saying: \"Say,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI seek refuge\", but he will drop the word \"say\" and say:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"I seek refuge.\"  On the contrary, if the messenger of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuperior officer conveys to somebody the message in these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords: \"Say, I seek refuge\", and this command is given to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim not only for his own person but to be conveyed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers, he will convey the words of the message verbatim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the people, and will not have the permission to drop\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything from the text of the message.\\tThus, the fact\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat these two Surahs begin with the word qul is a clear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproof that it is Divine Word, which the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) was bound to convey verbatim.  It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas not merely a command given to him for his person. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBesides these two Surahs, there are 330 other verses in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran which begin with the word qul (say).\\tThe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresence of qul in all these is a proof that it is Divine\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWord. which was obligatory for the Holy Prophet to convey\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverbatim; otherwise if qul everywhere had meant a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommand, the Holy Prophet would have dropped it and said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly that which he was commanded to say, and it would not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been recorded in the Quran, but, on the contrary, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould have remained content with saying only what he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommanded to say.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHere, if one considers this, one can understand fully\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell how unreasonable it is to regard the Companions as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinfallible and to make the clamor that a Companion has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen defamed as soon as one hears a saying or doing of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this being described as wrong.  Here, one can clearly see\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat a blunder happened to be committed by an illustrious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanion like Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud about two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs of the Quran.  If such an error could be committed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby an eminent Companion like him, others also might\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommit an error.  We can examine it in the scientific\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tway, and describe it as wrong if a thing said or done by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta Companion is proved to be wrong.  But wicked indeed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be the person who went beyond describing a wrong\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tact as wrong and started reproving and finding fault with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Companions of the Holy Prophet of Allah.  Concerning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Mu'awwidhatayn the commentators and traditionists\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave described the opinion of Ibn Mas'ud as wrong, but no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone has dared to say that by denying these two Surahs of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quran, he had, God forbid, become a disbeliever.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Question of Holy Prophet&apos;s being affected by Magic</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe second thing that has arisen in respect of these two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs is that, according to traditions, magic had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworked on the Holy Prophet, and he had fallen ill under\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits effect, and Gabriel (peace be on him) had instructed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim to repeat these Surahs to remove the charm.  This has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen objected to by many rationalists of both ancient and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmodern times.  They say that if these traditions are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccepted, the whole Shari'ah becomes doubtful.\\tFor if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet could be charmed, and according to these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditions he was charmed, one cannot say what the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet might have been made to say and do under the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinfluence of magic by his opponents, and what in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteaching may be Divine and what the result of magic.  Not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly this: they also allege that if this is accepted as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrue, it might well be that the Prophet might have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprompted to make the claim to Prophethood through magic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Prophet by misunderstanding might have thought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat an angel had come to him.\\tThey also argue that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese traditions clash with the Quran.\\tThe Quran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentions the accusation of the disbelievers who said that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet was bewitched (Bani Isra'il:47), but these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditions confirm the accusation of the disbelievers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Prophet had actually been charmed and bewitched.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFor a proper investigation of this question it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary that one should first see whether it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablished by authentic historical evidence that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace) had actually been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffected by magic, and if so, what it was and to what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textent.  Then it should be seen whether the objections\\n\\t\\t\\t\\traised against what is established historically do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactually apply to it or not.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Muslim scholars of the earliest period were truly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thonest and upright in that they did not try to corrupt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory or conceal facts according to their own ideas,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcepts and assumptions.  They conveyed intact to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlater generations whatever was confirmed historically,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand did not at all care how the material supplied by them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould be used by the one who was bent upon drawing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperverse conclusions from the facts.  Now, if something\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstands confirmed by authentic and historical means, it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneither right for an honest and rightminded person that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the should deny history on the ground that in case he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccepted it, it would lead to these evil results\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to his thinking, nor it is right that he should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadd to and stretch beyond its genuine limits by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconjecture and speculation whatever is established\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistorically.  Instead, he should accept history as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory and then see what is actually proved by it and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat is not.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs far as the historical aspect is concerned, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident of the Holy Prophet's being affected by magic is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsolutely confirmed, and if it can be refuted by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscientific criticism, then no historical event of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld can be proved right and genuine.\\tIt has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated by Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Imam Ahmad,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdur Razzaq, Humaidi, Baihaqi, Tabarani, Ibn Sad, Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMardayah, Ibn Abi Shaibah, Hakim, Abd bin Humaid and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother traditionists on the authority of Hadrat Aishah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Zaid bin Arqam and Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough so many different and numerous channels that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforgery is out of the question.  Although each tradition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby itself is an isolated report (khabar wahid), we give\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit below as a connected event from the details provided\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the traditions.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter the peace treaty of Hudaibiyah when the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (upon whom be peace) returned to Madinah, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeputation of the Jews of Khaibar visited Madinah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuharram, A.H. 7 and met a famous magician, Labid bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAsam, who belonged to the Ansar tribe of Bani Zurayq. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey said to him: \"You know how Muhammad (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's peace and blessings) has treated us.  We have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttried our best to bewitch him but have not succeeded. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow we have come to you because you are a more skilled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmagician.  Here are three gold coins, accept these and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcast a powerful magic spell on Muhammad.\"  In those days\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet had a Jewish boy as his attendant. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThrough him they obtained a piece of the Holy Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomb with some hair stuck to it.  Magic was worked on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame hair and the teeth of the comb.  According to some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditions, magic was worked by Labid bin Asam himself,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to others, his sisters were more skilled than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim and he got the spell cast through them.  Whatever be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe case, Labid placed this spell in the spathe of a male\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdate-tree and his it under a stone at the bottom of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDharwan or Dhi Arwan, the well of Bani Zurayq.\\tThe spell\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttook one whole year to have effect upon the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace).  In the latter half of the year the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet started feeling as if was unwell.\\tThe last\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforty days became hard on him, of which the last three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays were even harder.\\tBut its maximum effect on him was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he way melting away from within.  He thought he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdone a thing whereas, in fact, he had not done it: he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthought he had visited his wives whereas he had not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvisited them; and sometimes he would doubt having seen\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething whereas, in fact, he had not seen it.  All\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese effects were confined to his own person; so much so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the other people could not notice what state he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassing through.  As for his being a Prophet, no change\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurred in the performance of his duties.  There is no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttradition to say that he might have forgotten some verses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Quran in those days, or might have recited a verse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrongly, or a change might have occurred in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassemblies and in his counsels and sermons, or he might\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave presented a discourse as Revelation which may not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been revealed to him, or he might have missed a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPrayer and thought that he had performed it.  God forbid,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif any such thing had happened, it would have caused a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclamor and the whole of Arabia would have known that a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmagician had overpowered the one whom no power had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\table to overpower.  But the Holy Prophet's position as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet remained wholly unaffected by it.  Only in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonal life he remained worried on account of it.  At\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlast, one day when he was in the house of Hadrat Aishah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the prayed to Allah to be restored to full health.  In the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeantime he fell asleep or drowsed and on waking he said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Hadrat Aishah: \"My Lord has told me what I had asked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Him.\"  Hadrat Aishah asked what it was.  He replied:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Two men (i.e. two angels in human guise) came to me. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOne sat near my head and the other near my feet.  The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst asked: what has happened to him?\\tThe other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied: Magic has been worked on him.\\tThe first asked:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho has worked it?  He replied: Labid bin Asam.  He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked: In what is it contained?  He replied: In the comb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand hair covered in the spathe of a male date-tree.  He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked: where is it?  He replied: under a stone at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbottom of Dhi Arwan (or Dharwan), the well of Bani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZurayq.  He asked: what should be done about it?  He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied: the well should be emptied and it should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken out from under the stone.  The Holy Prophet then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsent Hadrat Ali, Hadrat Ammar bin Yasir and Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZubair: They were also joined by Jubair bin Iyas az-Zurqi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(two men from Bani Zurayq).  Later the Holy Prophet also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarrived at the well along with some Companions.  The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twater was taken out and the spathe recovered.  There they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfound that beside the comb and hair there was a cord with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\televen knots on it and a wax image with needles pricked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto it.  Gabriel (peace be on him) came and told him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepeat the Mu'awwidhatayn.  As he repeated verse after \\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse, a know was loosened and a needle taken out every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime, till on finishing the last words all the knots were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tloosened and all the needles removed, and he was entirely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfreed from the charm.  After this he called Laid and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestioned him.  He confessed his guilt and the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet let him go, for he never avenged himself on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanyone for any harm done to his person.  He even declined\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto talk about it to others, saying that Allah had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trestored him to health; therefore he did not like that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould incite the people against anyone.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is the story of the magic worked on the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet.  There if nothing in it which might run counter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto his office of Prophethood.  In his personal capacity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif any injury could be inflicted on him as it happened in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Battle of Uhud, if he could fall from his horse and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe hurt as is confirmed by the Hadith, if he could be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstung by a scorpion as has been mentioned in some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTraditions and none of these negates the protection\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpromised him by Allah in his capacity as a Prophet, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould also fall ill under the influence of magic in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonal capacity.  That a Prophet can be affected by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmagic is also confirmed by the Quran.  In Surah Al-A'raf\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit has been said about the magicians of Pharaoh that when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey confronted the Prophet Moses, they bewitched the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teyes of thousands of people who had assembled to witness\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe encounter (v. 116).  In Surah Ta Ha it has been said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat not only the common people but the Prophet Moses too\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfelt that the cords and staffs that they cast were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trunning towards them like so many snakes, and this filled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMoses' heart with fear.  Thereupon Allah revealed to him:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Don't fear for you will come out victorious.  Cast down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou staff.\" (vv. 66-69).  As for the objection that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen confirms the accusation of the disbelievers of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbewitched man, its answer is that the disbelievers did\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot call him a bewitched man in the sense that he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfallen ill under that effect of magic cast by somebody,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut in the sense that some magician has, God forbid, made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim mad, and he had made claim to Prophethood and was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttelling the people tales of Hell and Heaven in his same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmadness.  Now, obviously this objection does not at all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapply to a matter about which history confirms that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmagic spell had affected only the person of Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) and not the Prophethood of Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace), which remained wholly unaffected by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this connection, another thing worthy of mention is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the people who regard magic as a kind of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuperstition hold this view only because the effect of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmagic cannot be explained scientifically.  But there are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmany things in the world which one experiences and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobserves but one cannot explain scientifically how they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappen.  If we cannot give any such explanation it does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot become necessary that we should deny the thing itself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich we cannot explain.  Magic, in fact, is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpsychological phenomenon which can affect the body\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough the mind just as physical things affect the mind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough the body.  Fear, for instance, is a psychological\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tphenomenon, but it affects the body: the hair stand on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tend and the body shudders.  Magic does not; in fact,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchange the reality, but under its influence man's mind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand senses start feeling as if reality had changed.  The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstaffs and the cords that the magicians had thrown\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttowards the Prophet Moses, had not actually become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsnakes, but the eyes of the multitude of people were so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbewitched that everybody felt they were snakes; even the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsenses of the Prophet Moses could not remain unaffected\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the magic spell.  Likewise, in Al-Baqarah: 102, it has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen said that in Babylon people learnt such magic from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHarut and Marut as could cause division between husband\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand wife.  This too was a psychological phenomenon. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tObviously, if the people did not find it efficacious by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texperience they could not become its customers.  No\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoubt, it is correct that just like the bullet of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trifle and the bomb from the aircraft, magic too cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave effect without Allah's permission, but it would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmere stubbornness to deny a thing which has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texperienced and observed by man for thousands for years.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Question of Reciting Charms and Amulets in Islam</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe third thing that arises in connection with these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs is whether recitation of charms and amulets has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany place in Islam, and whether such recitation is by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\titself efficacious or not.  This question arises for in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmany hadith it has been reported that the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) at the time of going to bed every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnight, especially during illness, used to recite the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'awwidhatayn (or according to other reports, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'awwidhat, i.e. Qul Huwa-Allahu Ahad and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'awwidhatayn) thrice, blow in his hands and then rub\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe hands on his body from head to foot as far as his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thands could reach.  During his last illness when it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot longer possible for him to so do, Hadrat Aishah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited these Surahs herself or by his command blew on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this hands hin view of their being blessed and rubbed them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton his body.  Traditions on this subject have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated in Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Abu Da'ud\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Mu'atta of Imam Malik through authentic channels on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe authority of Hadrat Aishah herself beside whom no one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould be better acquainted with the domestic life of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this regard, one should first understand its religious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taspect.  In the Hadith a lengthy tradition has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated on the authority of Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas, at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe end of which the Holy Prophet is reported to have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: \"The people of my Ummah to enter Paradise without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treckoning will be those who neither turn to treatment by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbranding, nor to enchanting, nor take omens, but have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrust in their Lord.\" (Muslim).  According to a tradition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treported on the authority of Hadrat Mughirah bin Shubah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet said: \"He who got himself treated by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbranding, or enchanting, became independent of trust in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah.\" (Tirmidhi).  Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treported that the Holy Prophet disapproved of ten things\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone of which was recitation of charms and amulets except\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby means of the Mu'awwidhatayn or Mu'awwidhat.\\t(Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDaud, Ahmad, Nasai, Ibn Hibban, Hakim).  Some hadith also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshow that in the beginning the Holy Prophet had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taltogether forbidden recitation of charms and amulets,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut later he allowed it on the condition that it should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot smack of polytheism, but one should recite and blow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby means of the holy names of Allah, or the words of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran.\\tThe words used should be understandable and one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould know that there is nothing sinful in it, and one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould not wholly rely on the recitation of charms but on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's will to make it beneficial.\"  After the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplanation of the religious aspect, let us now see what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hadith says in this regard.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTabarani in As-Saghir has related a tradition on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority of Hadrat Ali, saying: \"One the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas stung by a scorpion during the Prayer.  When the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPrayer was over, he remarked: God's curse be on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscorpion: it neither spares a praying one, nor any other.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t Then he called for water and salt, and started rubbing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe place where the scorpion had stung with salt water\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand reciting Qul ya ayyuhal-kafirun, Qul Huwa Allahu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tahad, Qul a'udhu bi-Rabbil-falaq and Qul a'udhu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbi-Rabbin-nas, along with it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Abbas also has related a tradition to the effect:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) used to recite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis invocation over Hadrat Hasan and Husain: U'idhu kuma\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbi-kalimat Allahit-tamati min kulli shaitan-in wa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thammati-wa min kulli ayt-in-lam nati: \"I give you in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefuge of Allah's blameless words, from every devil and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttroublesome thing, and from every evil look.\" (Bukhari,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMusnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA tradition has been related in Muslim, Muwatta, Tabarani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Hakim about Uthman bin al-As ath-Thaqafi, with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlittle variation in wording, to the effect that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplained to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying: \"Since I have become a Muslim, I feel a pain in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmy body, which is killing me.\"\\tThe Holy Prophet said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Place your right hand on the place where you feel the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpain, then recite Bismillah thrice, and A'udhu billahi wa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqudratihi min sharri ma ajidu wa uhadhiru (\"I seek refuge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith Allah and with His power from the evil that I find\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand that I fear\") seven times, and rub your hand.\"  In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuwatta there is the addition: \"Uthman bin Abi al-As\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: After that my pain disappeared and now I teach the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame formula to the people of my house.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMusnad Ahmad and Tahavi contain this tradition from Talq\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Ali: \"I was stung by a scorpion in the presence of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace).\\tThe Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited something and blew over me and rubbed his hand on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe affected place.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim contains a tradition from Abu Said Khudri, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsays: \"Once when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfell ill, Gabriel came and asked: O Muhammad, are you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\till?  The Holy Prophet answered in the affirmative. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGabriel said: I blow on you in the name of Allah from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teverything which troubles you and from the evil of every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsoul and the evil look of every envier.  May Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trestore you to health.\\tI blow on you in His name.\"  A\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimilar tradition has been related in Musnad Ahmad on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority of Hadrat Ubadah bin as-Samit, which says: \"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet was unwell.  I went to visit him and found\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim in great trouble.  When I re-visited him in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevening I found him quite well.  When I asked how he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome well so soon, he said: Gabriel came and blew over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tme with some words.  Then he recited words similar to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose reported in the above Hadith.  A tradition similar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto this has been related on the authority of Hadrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAishah also in Muslim and Musnad Ahmad.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tImam Ahmad in his Musnad has related this tradition from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHafsah, mother of the Faithful: \"One day the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) visited me in the house and a woman,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnamed Shifa, was sitting with me.  She used to blow on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people to cure them of blisters.  The Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid to her: Teach Hafsah also the formula.\"  Imam Ahmad,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Daud and Nasai have related this tradition from Shifa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbint Abdullah herself, saying: \"The Holy Prophet said to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tme: Just as you have taught Hafsah reading and writing,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso teach her blowing to cure blisters as well.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Muslim there is a tradition from Auf bin Malik\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Ashjal to the effect: \"We used to practice blowing to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcure diseases.\\tWe asked the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) for his opinion in this regard.\\tHe said: Let me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknow the words with which you blow over the people. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere is no harm in blowing unless it smacks of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpolytheism.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim, Musnad Ahmad and Ibn Majah contain a tradition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Hadrat Jabir bin Abdullah, saying: \"The Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(upon whom be peace) had forbidden us blowing to cure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisease.  Then the people of the clan of Hadrat Amr bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHazm came and they said: We had a formula with which we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tused to blow on the people to cure them of scorpion's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsting (or snake-bite).\\tBut you have forbidden us the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice.  Then they recited before him the words which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey made use of.  Thereupon the Holy Prophet said: I do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot see any harm in it, so let the one who can do good to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this brother, do him good.\"  Another tradition from Jabir\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Abdullah in Muslim is: \"The family of Hazm had a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformula to cure snake-bite and the Holy Prophet permitted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem to practice it.\"  This is also supported by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttradition from Hadrat Aishah, which is contained in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim, Musnad Ahmad, and Ibn Majah: \"The Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgranted permission to a family of the Ansar for blowing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto cure the evils effects of biting by every poisonous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreature.\"  Traditions resembling these have been related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Hadrat Anas also in Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Ibn Majah, saying that the Holy Prophet gave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermission for blowing to cure the bite by poisonous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreatures, the disease of blisters and the effects of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevil look.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMusnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Hakim have related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis tradition on the authority of Hadrat Umair, freed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave of Abi al-Laham: \"In the pre-Islamic days I had a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformula with which I used to blow over the people.  I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited it before the Holy Prophet, whereupon he told me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto drop out such and such words from it, and permitted me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto blow with the rest of it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to Muwatta, Hadrat Abu Bakr went to the house\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his daughter, Hadrat Aishah, and found that she was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunwell and a Jewish woman was blowing over her. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThereupon he said to her: \"Blow over her by means of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBook of Allah.\"  This shows that if the people of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBook practice blowing by means of the verses of the Torah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Gospel, it is also permitted.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs for the question whether blowing for curing disease is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tefficacious also, or not, its answer is that the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (upon whom be peace) not only did not forbid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanybody to have recourse to cure and medical treatment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut himself stated that Allah has created a cure for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery disease and exhorted his followers to use cures. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe himself told the people remedies for certain diseases,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas can be seen in the Hadith in the Kitab at-Tib (Book of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCures).  But the cure can be beneficial and useful only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Allah's command and permission, otherwise if the cure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand medical treatment were beneficial in every case, no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone would have died in hospitals.  Now, if beside the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcure and medical treatment, Allah's Word and His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeautiful names also are made use of, or Word and His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeautiful names also are made use of, or Allah is turned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto and invoked for help by means of His Word, Names and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAttributes in a place where no medical aid is available,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit would not be against reason except for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaterialists.  However, it is not right to disregard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintentionally a cure or treatment where it is available,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand recourse had only to enchanting and reciting of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharms, and the people should start a regular practice of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgranting amulets as a means of earning their livelihood.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMany people in this regard argue from Hadrat Abu Said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhudri's tradition which has been related in Bukhari,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim, Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad, Abu Daud and Ibn Majah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand it is supported also by a tradition related in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBukhari on the authority of Ibn Abbas.\\tAccording to it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet sent some of his Companions including\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadrat Abu Said Khudri on an expedition.  They halted on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe way at the settlement of an Arabian tribe and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemanded hospitality from the people, but they refused to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textend any hospitality.  In the meantime the chief of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribe was stung by a scorpion and the people came to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttravelers to ask if they had any medicine or formula by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich their chief could be cured.  Hadrat Abu Said said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Yes, we do have, but since you have refused us\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thospitality, we would not treat him unless you promised\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tus to give us something.\"  They promised to give them a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflock of goats (according to some traditions, 30 goats),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Hadrat Abu Said went and started reciting Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Fatihah and rubbing his saliva on the affected place. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConsequently, the chief felt relieved of the effect of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe poison and the people of the tribe gave them the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoats as promised.  But the Companions said to one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother; \"Let us not make any use of the goats until we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave asked the Holy Prophet about it\", for they were not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsure whether it was permissible to accept any reward for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat they had done.  So they came before the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand related what had happened.\\tThe Holy Prophet smiled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand said: \"How did you know that Surah Al-Fatihah could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso be used for curing such troubles?\\tTake the goats\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand allocate my share also in it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBut before one used this Hadith for permission to adopt a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregular profession of granting amulets and reciting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharms, one should keep in view the conditions under\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich Hadrat Abu Said Khudri had recourse to it, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet not only held it as permissible but also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid that a share for him also should be allocated so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat there remained no doubt in the minds of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions that such a thing was permissible.  The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions in Arabia in those days were, as they still\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare, that settlements were situated hundreds of miles\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapart, there were not hotels and restaurants where a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraveler could buy food when he reached one of these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter several days' journey.  Under such conditions it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas considered a moral duty that when a traveler reached\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta settlement the people of the place should extend\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thospitality to him.  Refusal on their part in many cases\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeant death for the travelers, and this was looked upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas highly blameworthy among the Arabs.\\tThat is why the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace) allowed as permissible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe act of his Companions.  Since the people of the tribe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad refused them hospitality, they too refused to treat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir chief, and became ready to treat him only on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition that they should promise to give them something\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin return.  Then, when one of them with trust in God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited Surah Al-Fatihah over the chief and he became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell, the people gave the promised wages and the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet allowed that the wages be accepted as lawful and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpure.  In Bukhari the tradition related on the authority\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas about this incident contains\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Holy Prophet's words to the effect: \"Instead that you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould have acted otherwise, it was better that you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited the Book of Allah and accepted the wages for it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t He said this in order to impress the truth that Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWord is superior to every other kind of enchanting and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice of secret arts.  Furthermore, the Message also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas incidentally conveyed to the Arabian tribe and its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople made aware of the blessings of the Word that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet (upon whom be peace) had brought from Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t This incident cannot be cited as a precedent for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople who run clinic in the cities and towns for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice of secret arts and have adopted it as a regular\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprofession for earning livelihood.  No precedent of it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfound in the life and practice of the Holy Prophet (upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be peace) or his Companions, their followers and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearliest Imams.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class='section'><div class='heading'>Relation between Surah Al-Fatihah and the Mu&apos;awwidhatayn</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe last thing which is noteworthy with regard to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'awwidhatayn is the relation between the beginning and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe end of the Quran.  Although the Quran has not been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarranged chronologically, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace) arranged in the present order the verses and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurahs revealed during 23 years on different occasions to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeet different needs and situations not by himself but by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe command of Allah Who revealed them.  According to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis order, the Quran opens with the Surah Al-Fatihah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tends with the Mu'awwidhatayn.  Now, let us have a look at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe two.  In the beginning, after praising and glorifying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, Who is Lord of the worlds, Kind, Merciful and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMaster of the Judgment Day, the servants submits: \"Lord,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYou alone I worship and to You along I turn for help, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe most urgent help that I need from You is to be guided\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Straight Way.\"  In answer, he is given by Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe whole Quran to show him the Straight Way, which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcluded thus: Man prays to Allah, Who is Lord of dawn,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLord of men, King of men, Deity of men, saying: \"I seek\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefuge only with You for protection from every evil and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmischief of every creature, and in particular, from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevil whisperings of devils, be they from among men or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjinn, for they are the greatest obstacle in following the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tStraight Way.\"\\tThe relation that the beginning bears\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the end, cannot remain hidden from anyone who has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstanding and insight.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>"
