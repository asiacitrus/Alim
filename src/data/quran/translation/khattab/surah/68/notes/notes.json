He rejected the Prophet (&#65018;) as a madman, so the Quran responded by listing ten of his qualities&mdash;two of which were unknown to him: the fact that he was born out of wedlock and that his nose would be chopped off several years later at the Battle of Badr. At least three of his ten sons accepted Islam&mdash;including Kh&acirc;lid ibn Al-Wal&icirc;d.  "
