The Prophet (&#65018;) was retreating at a cave in the outskirts of Mecca when the angel Gabriel appeared to him, squeezing him tightly and ordering him to read. Since the Prophet (&#65018;) was unlettered, he responded, &ldquo;I cannot read.&rdquo; Ultimately, Gabriel taught him: &ldquo;Read in the Name of your Lord &hellip;&rdquo; Some scholars believe that this encounter is the fulfilment of Isaiah 29:12, which states, &ldquo;Then the book will be given to the one who is illiterate, saying, &lsquo;Read this.&rsquo; And he will say, &lsquo;I cannot read.&rsquo;&rdquo;  "
