    "Text": "   &nbsp;As mentioned in the Introduction, the Quran has three main themes: 1. Stories. 2. Muslim teachings. 3. And belief in the unseen. Since S&ucirc;rah 112 covers the third theme, the Prophet (&#65018;) says in a &#7717;ad&icirc;th collected by Bukh&acirc;ri and Muslim that reading this s&ucirc;rah&nbsp;equals reading one third of the Quran.
