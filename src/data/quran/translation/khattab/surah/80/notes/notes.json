The Prophet (&#65018;) frowned and turned all his attention to the man he was already talking to. This Meccan s&ucirc;rah&nbsp;was later revealed, telling the Prophet (&#65018;) that he should have tended to the faithful man who was eager to learn. After this s&ucirc;rah&nbsp;was revealed, the Prophet (&#65018;) would honour &rsquo;Abdull&acirc;h, calling him &lsquo;the man for whom my Lord rebuked me.&rsquo; He (&#65018;) even appointed him several times as his deputy over Medina.
