    "Text": "  &nbsp;Al-Isr&acirc;' refers to the Prophet&rsquo;s Night Journey from Mecca to Jerusalem about a year before his emigration (or Hijrah) from Mecca to Medina. This journey came as a comfort for the Prophet after several years of hardship and persecution, which included a 3-year siege by Meccan pagans, who drove the Muslims out of the city and forbade anyone from trading, marrying, or feeding them. This was followed by the &ldquo;Year of Sadness,&rdquo; which included the death of the Prophet&rsquo;s uncle Abu &#7788;&acirc;lib, the major defender of Mu&#7717;ammad (&#65018;) despite his disbelief in his message, as well as the death of the Prophet&rsquo;s beloved wife Khad&icirc;jah. The Prophet was carried overnight by a noble steed (called Bur&acirc;q) from Mecca to Jerusalem where he met some earlier prophets and led them in prayer. He was later carried to the heavens (this journey is called Al-Mi&rsquo;r&acirc;j, or the Ascension) where he received direct orders from Allah to observe five daily prayers. The Ascension is referred to in 53:13&ndash;18.  "
