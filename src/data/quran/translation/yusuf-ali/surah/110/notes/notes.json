    "Body": "The Prophet migrated from Makkah to Madinah, a persecuted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman. In Madinah all the forces of truth and righteousness\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trallied round him, and the efforts by the Makkans and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir confederates to destroy him and his community\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecoiled on their own heads. Gradually all the outlying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparts of Arabia ranged themselves round his standard, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe bloodless conquest of Makkah was the crown and prize\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his patience and constant endeavour. After that, whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribes and tracts of country gave their adhesion to him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcollectively, and before his ministry was finished, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsoil was prepared for the conquest of the wide world for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam. What was the lesson to be learnt from this little\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tepitome of the world's history? Not man's self-glory, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thumility; and power but service; not an appeal to man's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tselfishness or self-sufficiency, but a realisation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's Grace and Mercy, and the abundant outpouring of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's Praises in word and conduct."

But the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah had also another duty and privilege,-to pray for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrace and forgiveness for his people in case any of them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad exulted in their victory or done anything that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould not have done."
