    "Body": " Most of the classical commentators regard this passage as a legal injunction, and interpret it, therefore, as follows: \"The recompense of those who make war on God and His apostle and spread corruption on earth shall but be that they shall be slain, or crucified, or that their hands and feet be cut off on opposite sides, or that they shall be banished from the earth: such shall be their ignominy in this world.\" This interpretation is, however, in no way warranted by the text, and this for the following reasons:  \r\\n \r\\n(a)\\tThe four passive verbs occurring in this sentence - \"slain\", \"crucified\", \"cut off\" and \"banished\" - are in the present tense and do not, by themselves, indicate the future or, alternatively, the imperative mood. \r\\n \r\\n \r\\n(b)\\tThe form yuqattalu does not signify simply \"they are being slain\" or (as the commentators would have it) \"they shall be slain\", but denotes - in accordance with a fundamental rule of Arabic grammar - \"they are being slain in great numbers\"; and the same holds true of the verbal forms yusallabu (\"they are being crucified in great numbers\") and yuqatta'a (\"cut off in great numbers\"). Now if we are to believe that these are \"ordained punishments\", it would imply that great numbers - but not necessarily all - of \"those who make war on God and His apostle\" should be punished in this way: obviously an inadmissible assumption of arbitrariness on the part of the Divine Law-Giver. Moreover, if the party \"waging war on God and His apostle\" should happen to consist of one person only, or of a few, how could a command referring to \"great numbers\" be applied to them or to him? \r\\n \r\\n \r\\n(c)\\tFurthermore, what would be the meaning of the phrase, \"they shall be banished from the earth\", if the above verse is to be taken as a legal injunction? This point has, indeed, perplexed the commentators considerably. Some of them assume that the transgressors should be \"banished from the land [of Islam]\": but there is no instance in the Qur'an of such a restricted use of the term \"earth\" (ard). Others, again, are of the opinion that the guilty ones should be imprisoned in a subterranean dungeon, which would constitute their \"banishment from [the face of] the earth\"!\r\\n \r\\n \r\\n(d) \\tFinally - and this is the weightiest objection to an interpretation of the above verse as a \"legal injunction\" - the Qur'an places exactly the same expressions referring to mass-crucifixion and mass-mutilation (but this time with a definite intent relating to the future) in the mouth of Pharaoh, as a threat to believers (see 7:124, 20:71 and 26:49). Since Pharaoh is invariably described in the Qur'an as the epitome of evil and godlessness, it is inconceivable that the same Qur'an would promulgate a divine law in precisely the terms which it attributes elsewhere to a figure characterized as an \"enemy of God\". \r\\n \r\\n \r\\nIn short, the attempt of the commentators to interpret the above verse as a \"legal injunction\" must be categorically rejected, however great the names of the persons responsible for it. On the other hand, a really convincing interpretation suggests itself to us at once as soon as we read the verse - as it ought to be read - in the present tense: for, read in this way, the verse reveals itself immediately as a statement of fact - a declaration of the inescapability of the retribution which \"those who make war on God\" bring upon themselves. Their hostility to ethical imperatives causes them to lose sight of all moral values; and their consequent mutual discord and \"perverseness\" gives rise to unending strife among themselves for the sake of worldly gain and power: they kill one another in great numbers, and torture and mutilate one another in great numbers, with the result that whole communities are wiped out or, as the Qur'an puts it, \"banished from [the face of] the earth\". It is this interpretation alone that takes full account of all the expressions occurring in this verse - the reference to \"great numbers\" in connection with deeds of extreme violence, the \"banishment from the earth\", and, lastly, the fact that these horrors are expressed in the terms used by Pharaoh, the \"enemy of God\".\r\\n "

    "Body": " The extreme severity of this Qur'anic punishment can be understood only if one bears in mind the fundamental principle of Islamic Law that no duty (taklif) is ever imposed on man without his being granted a corresponding right (haqq); and the term \"duty\" also comprises, in this context, liability to punishment. Now, among the inalienable rights of every member of the Islamic society - Muslim and non-Muslim alike - is the right to protection (in every sense of the word) by the community as a whole. As is evident from innumerable Qur'anic ordinances as well as the Prophet's injunctions forthcoming from authentic Traditions, every citizen is entitled to a share in the community's economic resources and, thus, to the enjoyment of social security: in other words, he or she must be assured of an equitable standard of living commensurate with the resources at the disposal of the community. For, although the Qur'an makes it clear that human life cannot be expressed in terms of physical existence alone - the ultimate values of life being spiritual in nature - the believers are not entitled to look upon spiritual truths and values as something that could be divorced from the physical and social factors of human existence. In short, Islam envisages and demands a society that provides not only for the spiritual needs of man, but for his bodily and intellectual needs as well. It follows, therefore, that - in order to be truly Islamic - a society (or state) must be so constituted that every individual, man and woman, may enjoy that minimum of material well-being and security without which there can be no human dignity, no real freedom and, in the last resort, no spiritual progress: for, there can be no real happiness and strength in a society that permits some of its members to suffer undeserved want while others have more than they need. If the whole society suffers privations owing to circumstances beyond its control (as happened, for instance, to the Muslim community in the early days of Islam), such shared privations may become a source of spiritual strength and, through it, of future greatness. But if the available resources of a community are so unevenly distributed that certain groups within it live in affluence while the majority of the people are forced to use up all their energies in search of their daily bread, poverty becomes the most dangerous enemy of spiritual progress, and occasionally drives whole communities away from God-consciousness and into the arms of soul-destroying materialism. It was undoubtedly this that the Prophet had in mind when he uttered the warning words (quoted by As-Suyuti in Al-Jami' as-Saghir), \"Poverty may well turn into a denial of the truth (kufr).\" Consequently, the social legislation of Islam aims at a state of affairs in which every man, woman and child has (a) enough to eat and wear, (b) an adequate home, (c) equal opportunities and facilities for education, and (d) free medical care in health and in sickness. A corollary of these rights is the right to productive and remunerative work while of working age and in good health, and a provision (by the community or the state) of adequate nourishment, shelter, etc. in cases of disability resulting from illness, widowhood, enforced unemployment, old age, or under-age. As already mentioned, the communal obligation to create such a comprehensive social security scheme has been laid down in many Qur'anic verses, and has been amplified and explained by a great number of the Prophet's commandments. It was the second Caliph, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, who began to translate these ordinances into a concrete administrative scheme (see Ibn Sad, Tabaqat III/1, 213-217); but after his premature death, his successors had neither the vision nor the statesmanship to continue his unfinished work.  \r\\n\r\\n \r\\nIt is against the background of this social security scheme envisaged by Islam that the Qur'an imposes the severe sentence of hand-cutting as a deterrent punishment for robbery. Since, under the circumstances outlined above, \"temptation\" cannot be admitted as a justifiable excuse, and since, in the last resort, the entire socio-economic system of Islam is based on the faith of its adherents, its balance is extremely delicate and in need of constant, strictly-enforced protection. In a community in which everyone is assured of full security and social justice, any attempt on the part of an individual to achieve an easy, unjustified gain at the expense of other members of the community must be considered an attack against the system as a whole, and must be punished as such: and, therefore, the above ordinance which lays down that the hand of the thief shall be cut off. One must, however, always bear in mind the principle mentioned at the beginning of this note: namely, the absolute interdependence between man's rights and corresponding duties (including liability to punishment). In a community or state which neglects or is unable to provide complete social security for all its members, the temptation to enrich oneself by illegal means often becomes irresistible - and, consequently, theft cannot and should not be punished as severely as it should be punished in a state in which social security is a reality in the full sense of the word. If the society is unable to fulfil its duties with regard to every one of its members, it has no right to invoke the full sanction of criminal law (hadd) against the individual transgressor, but must confine itself to milder forms of administrative punishment. (It was in correct appreciation of this principle that the great Caliph 'Umar waived the hadd of hand-cutting in a period of famine which afflicted Arabia during his reign.) To sum up, one may safely conclude that the cutting-off of a hand in punishment for theft is applicable only within the context of an already-existing, fully functioning social security scheme, and in no other circumstances. \r\\n"

This term has, I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve, been used here metaphorically, and is meant to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcircumscribe all practices of an idolatrous nature - like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaint-worship, the attribution of \"magic\" properties to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcertain inanimate objects, the observance of all manner\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof superstitious taboos, and so forth. - For an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplanation of the expression rendered by me as \"divining\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the future\" (al-azlam, lit., \"divining-arrows\"), see\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnote [9] on the second paragraph of verse {3} of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurah."

Moreover, according to an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthentic Tradition quoted in the Mustadrak, Mu'adh ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJabal stated unequivocally that the Prophet himself had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timparted to him the reading hal tastati' rabbaka\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(\"Couldst thou prevail upon thy Sustainer?\"). To my mind,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe weight of evidence points to this second alternative:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut in view of the more general reading, I have rendered\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe phrase as above. As regards the disciples' request -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Jesus' subsequent prayer - for a heavenly \"repast\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(ma'idah, the word which gave the title to this surah),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit might possibly be an echo of the request for daily\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbread contained in the Lord's Prayer (cf. Matthew vi,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t11), since, in religious terminology, every benefit that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccrues to man is \"sent down from heaven\" - that is, by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod - even if it comes into being through man's own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tefforts. But, on the other hand, the manner in which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisciples are said to have asked for the \"repast\" - and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticularly their explanation given in the next verse -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trather seems to point to a request for a miracle which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould assure them of God's \"acceptance\" of their faith.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(See also next note.)"
