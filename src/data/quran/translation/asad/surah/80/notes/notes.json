    "Body": "One day, as recorded in many well-authenticated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTraditions, the Prophet was engrossed in a conversation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith some of the most influential chieftains of pagan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMecca, hoping to convince them - and, through them, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMeccan community at large - of the truth of his message.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt that point, he was approached by one of his followers,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe blind 'Abd Allah ibn Shurayh - known after his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrandmother's name as Ibn Umm Maktum - with the request\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor a repetition or elucidation of certain earlier\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassages of the Qur'an. Annoyed by this interruption of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat he momentarily regarded as a more important\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tendeavour, Muhammad \"frowned and turned away\" from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblind man - and was immediately, there and then, reproved\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the revelation of the first ten verses of this surah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn later years he often greeted Ibn Umm Maktum with these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords of humility: \"Welcome unto him on whose account my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSustainer has rebuked me ('atabani)!\" Indirectly, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsharp Qur'anic rebuke (stressed, in particular, by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuse of the third-person form in verses {1-2}) implies,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirstly, that what would have been a minor act of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscourtesy on the part of an ordinary human being,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassumed the aspect of a major sin, deserving a divine\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trebuke, when committed by a prophet; and, secondly, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tillustrates the objective nature of the Qur'anic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation: for, obviously, in conveying God's reproof of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim to the world at large, the Prophet \"does not speak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout of his own desire\" (cf.  53:3 )."

Whereas some commentators are of the opinion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat this relates only to the type of man spoken of in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse {17} above, others maintain, with greater\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplausibility, that it is a reference to man in general -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthus: \"No human being has ever fulfilled all that was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timposed on him as a [moral] duty\" (Mujahid, as quoted by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTabari, with a similar statement attributed by Baghawi to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Hasan al-Basri); or \"From the time of Adam to this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime, no human being has ever been free of shortcomings\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Zamakhshari, Baydawi).
