On the other hand, since adultery is an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tillicit sexual union, the verb yankihu, which appears\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwice in this passage, cannot have the customary,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecific meaning of \"he marries\" but must, rather, be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstood in its general sense - applicable to both\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlawful and unlawful sexual intercourse - namely, \"he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcouples with\". It is in this sense that the great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentator Abu Muslim (as quoted by Razi) explains the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove verse, which stresses the fact that both partners\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare equally guilty inasmuch as they commit their sin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsciously - implying that neither of them can excuse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself or herself on the ground of having been merely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"seduced\"."

The severity of the punishment to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeted out in such cases, as well as the requirement of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfour witnesses - instead of the two that Islamic Law\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregards as sufficient in all other criminal and civil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuits - is based on the imperative necessity of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreventing slander and off-hand accusations. As laid down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin several authentic sayings of the Prophet, the evidence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the four witnesses must be direct, and not merely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcircumstantial: in other words, it is not sufficient for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem to have witnessed a situation which made it evident\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat sexual intercourse was taking or had taken place:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey must have witnessed the sexual act as such, and must\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe able to prove this to the entire satisfaction of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjudicial authority (Razi, summing up the views of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreatest exponents of Islamic Law). Since such a complete\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevidence is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobtain, it is obvious that the purpose of the above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'anic injunction is to preclude, in practice, all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthird-party accusations relating to illicit sexual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercourse - for, \"man has been created weak\" ({4: 28})\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t- and to make a proof of adultery dependent on a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvoluntary, faith-inspired confession of the guilty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparties themselves."

The number \"three\" used\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwice in this context is not, of course, enumerative or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texclusive, but is obviously meant to stress the recurrent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnature of the occasions on which even the most familiar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmembers of the household, including husbands, wives and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchildren, must respect that privacy."
