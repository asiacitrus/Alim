    "Body": "  &nbsp;Generally speaking, there is a difference between witnessing and giving testimony before a judge. Verse 2:282 talks about witnessing a debt contract, not giving testimony. To fully understand the context of this verse, we need to keep in mind that 1500 years ago women did not normally participate in business transactions or travel with trading caravans and, therefore, not every woman had the expertise to witness a debt contract. Even if two women were available at the time of signing the contract, perhaps the primary witness might not be able to recall the details of the contract or appear before a judge because of compelling circumstances such as pregnancy or delivery. In any of these cases, the second woman will be a back-up. Some scholars maintain that one woman can be sufficient as a witness so long as she is reliable. As for giving testimony, a ruling can be made based on available testimony, regardless of the number or gender of the witnesses. For example, the beginning of Rama&#7693;&acirc;n is usually confirmed by the sighting of the new moon, regardless of the gender of the person who sights the moon. Also the highest form of witness in Islam is for someone to testify they heard a narration (or &#7717;ad&icirc;th) from the Prophet (&#65018;). An authentic &#7717;ad&icirc;th&nbsp;is accepted by all Muslims regardless of the gender of the narrator. Moreover, if a husband accuses his wife of adultery and he has no witnesses, each spouse must testify five times that they are telling the truth and the other side is lying. Both testimonies are equal (see&nbsp;24:6-10). In some cases, only women&rsquo;s testimony is accepted while men&rsquo;s testimony is rejected, such as testifying regarding a woman&rsquo;s pregnancy or virginity.   "

Abu Sufy&acirc;n, commander of the Meccan army, sent a man to discourage the Muslims from following the Meccans. Although the man falsely claimed that the Meccans were mobilizing to launch a decisive attack on Medina, the Prophet became more determined to chase them away. Eventually, the Meccans decided to flee and not waste their victory after the Prophet sent a revert to Islam&mdash;who was friends with Abu Sufy&acirc;n&mdash;to convince him to withdraw; otherwise Muslims were going to avenge their loss at U&#7717;ud.

According to Islamic teachings, no free person can be enslaved. Islam also improved the condition of slaves. It was unlawful to separate a mother from her child. Children born to a slave-master were deemed free, and their mother would gain her freedom upon the death of her master. With regards to slaves, Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad (&#65018;) says, &ldquo;Feed them from what you eat, clothe them from what you wear, and do not overwhelm them with work unless you assist them.&rdquo; He (&#65018;) also says, &ldquo;Whoever kills his slave will be killed and whoever injures his slave will be injured.&rdquo; In recent times, slavery has been outlawed in all countries&mdash;including the Muslim world.

So he (&#65018;) called upon the faithful to pledge allegiance to him under a tree at &#7716;udaibiyah in the outskirts of Mecca. Shortly after, &rsquo;Uthm&acirc;n returned safely and a peace agreement was signed by the Muslims and Meccan pagans, stating in part that the Muslims would have to return to Medina and come back next year for &rsquo;umrah. The Treaty of &#7716;udaibiyah is described as a clear triumph since it established peace, temporarily diffused the tension between the Muslims and the Meccan pagans, and gave the Muslims plenty of time to spread awareness and understanding of their faith.

    "Body": "According to most of the authorities, this invocation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(which occurs at the beginning of every surah with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texception of surah 9) constitutes an integral part of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Opening\" and is, therefore, numbered as verse {1}.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn all other instances, the invocation \"in the name of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod\" precedes the surah as such, and is not counted among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits verses. - Both the divine epithets rahman and rahim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare derived from the noun rahmah, which signifies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"mercy\", \"compassion\", \"loving tenderness\" and, more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomprehensively, \"grace\". From the very earliest times,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic scholars have endeavoured to define the exact\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshades of meaning which differentiate the two terms. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbest and simplest of these explanations is undoubtedly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe one advanced by Ibn al-Qayyim (as quoted in Manar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI,48): the term rahman circumscribes the quality of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabounding grace inherent in, and inseparable from, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcept of God's Being, whereas rahim expresses the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanifestation of that grace in, and its effect upon, His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreation - in other words, an aspect of His activity."

    "Body": "In this instance, the term \"worlds\" denotes all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategories of existence both in the physical and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspiritual sense. The Arabic expression rabb - rendered by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tme as \"Sustainer\" - embraces a wide complex of meanings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot easily expressed by a single term in another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlanguage. It comprises the ideas of having a just claim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the possession of anything and, consequently,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority over it, as well as of rearing, sustaining and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfostering anything from its inception to its final\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompletion. Thus, the head of a family is called rabb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tad-dar (\"master of the house\") because he has authority\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover it and is responsible for its maintenance;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimilarly, his wife is called rabbat ad-dar (\"mistress of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe house\"). Preceded by the definite article al, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdesignation rabb is applied, in the Qur'an, exclusively\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto God as the sole fosterer and sustainer of all creation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t- objective as well as conceptual - and therefore the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tultimate source of all authority."

    "Body": "According to almost all the commentators, God's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"condemnation\" (ghadab, lit., \"wrath\") is synonymous with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe evil consequences which man brings upon himself by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twilfully rejecting God's guidance and acting contrary to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis injunctions. Some commentators (e.g., Zamakhshari)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpret this passage as follows: \"...the way of those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon whom Thou hast bestowed Thy blessings - those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave not been condemned [by Thee], and who do not go\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tastray\": in other words, they regard the last two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpressions as defining \"those upon whom Thou hast\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbestowed Thy blessings\". Other commentators (e.g.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBaghawi and Ibn Kathir) do not subscribe to this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretation - which would imply the use of negative\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefinitions - and understand the last verse of the surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the manner rendered by me above. As regards the two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategories of people following a wrong course, some of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe greatest Islamic thinkers (e.g., Al-Ghazali or, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecent times, Muhammad 'Abduh) held the view that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople described as having incurred \"God's condemnation\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t- that is, having deprived themselves of His grace - are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who have become fully cognizant of God's message\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand, having understood it, have rejected it; while by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"those who go astray\" are meant people whom the truth has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teither not reached at all, or to whom it has come in so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgarbled and corrupted a form as to make it difficult for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem to recognize it as the truth (see 'Abduh in Manar I,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t68 ff.)."
