    "Body": "This is probably the earliest occurrence of the term\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmunafiq in the chronology of Qur'anic revelation.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIdiomatically, the term is derived from the noun nafaq,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich denotes an \"underground passage\" having an outlet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifferent from the entry, and signifying, specifically,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe complicated burrow of a field-mouse, a lizard, etc.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom which the animal can easily escape or in which it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcan outwit a pursuer. Tropically, the term munafiq\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescribes a person who is \"two-faced\", inasmuch as he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talways tries to find an easy way out of any real\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommitment, be it spiritual or social, by adapting his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcourse of action to what promises to be of practical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadvantage to him in the situation in which he happens to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfind himself. Since a person thus characterized usually\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpretends to be morally better than he really is, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tepithet munafiq may roughly be rendered as \"hypocrite\".\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt should, however, be noted that whereas this Western\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterm invariably implies conscious dissembling with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintent to deceive others, the Arabic term mun afiq may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso be applied - and occasionally is applied in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an - to a person who, being weak or uncertain in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeliefs or moral convictions, merely deceives himself.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHence, while using in my rendering of the Qur'anic text\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe conventional expression \"hypocrite\", I have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tendeavoured to point out the above differentiation,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhenever possible and necessary, in my explanatory notes."

The implication is that people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho deny the validity of any spiritual commitment arising\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout of oneâ€™s faith in \"something that is beyond the reach\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof human perception\" (al-ghayb) - in this case, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texistence of God - are, as a rule, unwilling to tolerate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch a faith and such a commitment in others as well: and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso they endeavour to bring the believers to their way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthinking by a sarcastic, contemptuous reference to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talleged irrelevance of the concept of \"sin\" as such."

In the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresent instance it is meant to illustrate the truth that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno one - not even a prophet - can bestow faith on another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson (cf.  28:56  - \"thou canst not guide aright\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teveryone whom thou lovest\").

The identical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfigure - 950 years - is given in the Bible (Genesis ix,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t29) as Noah's life-span. By repeating this element of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBiblical legend, the Qur'an merely stresses the fact that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe duration of a prophet's mission has nothing to do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith its success or failure, since \"all true guidance is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod's guidance\" ( 3:73 ) - and, as we are so often told\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the Qur'an, \"God guides [only] him that wills [to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguided]\". Thus, the reference to Noah is meant to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treassure the believer who may be distressed at seeing the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmajority of his fellow-men refuse to accept, all at once,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta truth which appears self-evident to him."

The ever-recurring emergence,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecay and re-emergence of life, so vividly exemplified in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall organic nature, is often cited in the Qur'an not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmerely in support of the doctrine of resurrection, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso as evidence of a consciously-devised plan underlying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreation as such - and, thus, of the existence of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCreator."
