In the above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontext it denotes man's obsessive striving for more and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore comforts, more material goods, greater power over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this fellow-men or over nature, and unceasing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttechnological progress. A passionate pursuit of such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tendeavours, to the exclusion of everything else, bars man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom all spiritual insight and, hence, from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacceptance of any restrictions and inhibitions based on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurely moral values - with the result that not only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindividuals but whole societies gradually lose all inner\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstability and, thus, all chance of happiness."
