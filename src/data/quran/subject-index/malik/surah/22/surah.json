    "Text": "Strive in the Way of Allah as you ought to strive with sincerity\\n\\t\\t\\tand discipline; He has chosen you and has not laid upon you any\\n\\t\\t\\thardship in the observance of your faith - the faith of your\\n\\t\\t\\tfather Ibrahim (Abraham). He named you Muslims before in prior\\n\\t\\t\\tscriptures and in this (The Qur'an), so that His Rasool may\\n\\t\\t\\ttestify against you and you yourselves may testify against rest\\n\\t\\t\\tof the mankind. Therefore, establish Salah, pay Zakah and hold\\n\\t\\t\\tfast to Allah; Who is your Protector - so what an excellent\\n\\t\\t\\tProtector and what a splendid Supporter!"
