    "Text": "<note id=\"0\">\\n<H2><B>Name</B></H2> <P> The surah takes its name, Al-Mu'minun, from the first verse.  </P> <H2><B>Period of Revelation.</B></H2> <P> Both its style and theme indicate that it was revealed during the middle stage of Prophethood at Makkah. Reading between the lines, one feels that a bitter conflict had begun between the, Holy Prophet and the disbelievers of Makkah, though the persecution by them had not yet become tyrannical. It appears that the surah was sent down during the climax of the &quot;Famine&quot; in Makkah (vv. 75-76), which according to authentic traditions occurred during the middle stage of Prophethood. Moreover, according to a tradition related by 'Urwah bin Zubair, Hadarat Umar who had embraced Islam by that time, said, &quot;This Surah was revealed in my presence and I myself observed the state of the Holy Prophet during its revelation. When the revelation ended , the Holy Prophet remarked, 'On this occasion ten such verses have been sent down to me that the one who measures up to them, will most surely go to Paradise'. Then he recited the initial verses of the surah.&quot; (Ahmad, Tirmizi, Nasai, Hakim).  </P> <H2><B>Theme Topics</B></H2> <P> The central theme of the surah is to invite the people to accept and follow the Message of the Holy Prophet and the whole Surah revolves round this theme.  </P> <H2><B>Summary</B></H2> <P>\\n<SPAN>The fact that the people who have accepted the Message of the Holy Prophet have started acquiring such and such noble qualities of character is a practical proof of the truth of the Message. </SPAN><STRONG><SPAN>1 - 11</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN> </SPAN> </P> <P>\\n<SPAN>In this passage, attention has been drawn to the creation of man and the universe to impress that the whole universe including man's own self, is a clear proof of the truth of the Holy Prophet's Message, which invites the people to accept </SPAN><EM><SPAN>Tauhid</SPAN></EM><SPAN> and life in the Hereafter. </SPAN><STRONG><SPAN>12 - 22</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN> </SPAN> </P> <P> Then the stories of the former Prophets and their communities have been cited as historical evidences of the truth of the Message. They prove the following things :  </P> <OL>\\n<LI>\\n<P> The objections and the doubts that the antagonists are raising against the Message of Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) are not new. These were raised against the former Prophets also whom they themselves acknowledged as Messengers of Allah. Therefore they should learn a lesson from their history and judge for themselves whether the Prophets were in the right or their objectors.  </P> </LI>\\n<LI>\\n<P>\\n<SPAN>The Message of </SPAN><EM><SPAN>Tauhid</SPAN></EM><SPAN> and the Hereafter that Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) is conveying is the same as was brought by the former Prophets; therefore they should accept it. </SPAN> </P> </LI>\\n<LI>\\n<P> They should take a warning from the consequences met by those communities who rejected the Message of their Prophets.  </P> </LI>\\n<LI>\\n<P>\\n<SPAN>All the Prophets brought one and the same religion from Allah and they all belonged to one and the same community. All other religions were invented by the people themselves and none of them is from Allah. </SPAN><STRONG><SPAN>23 - 54</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN> </SPAN> </P> </LI>\\n</OL> <P>\\n<SPAN>After relating the stories of the Prophets, a fundamental principle has been enunciated: Success and prosperity in the worldly life is not a criterion of success in the sight of Allah. If some persons (or a person) are enjoying prosperity, wealth, power and the like in this world, it does not mean that they are favorites of Allah. Likewise, the poverty and adversity of other people is not a proof that Allah is displeased with them. The real criterion is Faith (or lack of it). This declaration was needed because the antagonists of the Holy Prophet were the great chiefs of Makkah, who (and their followers) were deluded by their own prosperity that God and their deities were well pleased with them. On the other hand, they argued, the fact that Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) and his followers were indigent and in a state of helplessness, was a clear proof that Allah was not pleased with them, and they were under the curse of their deities. </SPAN><STRONG><SPAN>55 - 67</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN> </SPAN> </P> <P>\\n<SPAN>In this passage different arguments have been used to convince them that Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) was a true Prophet of Allah. Then they have been told that the Famine (vv. 75 - 76) was merely a warning and therefore &quot;it is better for you to mend your ways; otherwise you will be visited by a terrible scourge.&quot; </SPAN><STRONG><SPAN>68 - 77</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN> </SPAN> </P> <P>\\n<SPAN>Again they have been invited to observe the Signs in the universe and in their own selves because these are clear proofs of the truth of the Message of the Holy Prophet. </SPAN><STRONG><SPAN>78 - 95</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN> </SPAN> </P> <P>\\n<SPAN>The Holy Prophet has been told not to adopt any wrong way in retaliation to counteract the evil ways of the enemies, and to guard against the incitement of Satan. </SPAN><STRONG><SPAN>96 - 97</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN> </SPAN> </P> <P>\\n<SPAN>In this concluding passage, the enemies of the truth have been warned that they shall have to render an account in the Hereafter and bear the consequences of their persecution of the Believers; therefore they should mend their ways. </SPAN><STRONG><SPAN>98 - 118</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN> </SPAN> </P> <P ALIGN=\"RIGHT\"></P>   \\n\\t\\t\\t</note>"

On the one hand, there were the well-to-do and prosperous chiefs of Makkah, the opponents of Islam, whose business was thriving and who were enjoying every good thing of life, and on the other hand, there were the followers of Islam majority of whom were either poor from the beginning, or had been reduced to poverty by ruthless antagonism to Islam. Therefore, the assertion, &quot;Most certainly the Believers have attained true success&quot;, with which the discourse begins, was meant to tell the disbelievers that the criterion of success and failure that they had in mind was not correct. It was based on misconceptions besides being transitory and limited in nature: it led to failure and not true success. On the contrary, the followers of Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him), whom they regarded as failures, were truly successful, because by accepting the invitation to the Right Guidance given by the Messenger of Allah, they had struck a bargain which would lead them to true success and everlasting bliss in this world as well as in the Hereafter, whereas by rejecting the Message the opponents had incurred loss and would meet with the evil consequences both in this world and in the next.  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">This is the main theme of the Surah and the whole discourse, from the beginning to the end, is meant to impress the same.  </P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote2\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote2sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote2anc\">2</A>The noble characteristics of the Believers pointed out in vv. 2-9 are the arguments to prove the above assertion. In other words, it has been stated that people with such and such traits and qualities only can attain true success in this world and in the Hereafter.</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote3\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote3sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote3anc\">3</A>Khashi`un in the Text is from khushu (to bow down, to express humility) which is a condition of the heart as well as of the body. Khushu' of the heart is to fear and stand in awe of a powerful person, and khushu ` of the body is to bow one's head and lower one's gaze and voice in his presence. In Salat one is required to show khushu ` both of the heart and of the body, and this is the essence of the Prayer. It has been reported that when the Holy Prophet once saw a person offering his Prayer as well as playing with his beard, he remarked: &quot;Had he khushu ` in his heart, his body would have manifested it. &quot;</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">Though khushu ` is actually a condition of the heart, as stated by the above tradition, it is manifested by the body as a matter of course. The Shari `ah has enjoined certain etiquette which, on the one hand, helps produce khushu ` in the heart, and on the other, helps sustain the physical act of the Prayer in spite of the fluctuating condition of the heart. According to this etiquette, one should neither turn to the right or left, nor raise one's head to look up: one may, however, look around from the corner of the eye, but as far as possible, one must fix the gaze on the place where the forehead would rest in prostration; one is also forbidden to shift about, incline side ways, fold the garments or shake off dust from them. It is also forbidden that while going down for prostration, one should clean the place where one would sit or perform prostration. Similarly it is disrespectful that one should stand stuffy erect, recite the verses of the Qur'an in a loud resounding voice, or sing them, or belch or yawn repeatedly and noisily. It has also not been approved that one should offer the Prayer in a hurry. The injunction is that each article of the Prayer should be performed in perfect peace and tranquility, and unless one article has been completely performed, the next should not be begun. If one feels hurt by something during the Prayer, one may cast it aside by one hand, but moving the hand repeatedly or using both the hands for the purpose is prohibited. with this etiquette of the body, it is also important that one should irrelevant things during the Prayer. If thoughts come to the mind intention, it is a natural human weakness, but one should try one's  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">Along avoid thinking without one's utmost that the mind and heart are wholly turned towards Allah, and the mind is in full harmony and tune with the tongue, and as soon as one becomes conscious of irrelevant thoughts one should immediately turn the attention to the Prayer.</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote4\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote4sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote4anc\">4</A>Literally, laghv is anything nonsensical, meaningless and vain, which is in no way conducive to achieving one's goal and purpose in life. The Believers pay no heed to such useless things and they show no inclination or interest for them. If by chance they see such things being indulged in, they keep away and avoid them scrupulously, or treat them with utmost indifference. This attitude has been described in Al-Furqan (XXV): 72, thus: &quot; ... if they have to pass by what is vain, they pass by like dignified people.&quot;  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">This is indeed one of the outstanding characteristics of the Believer. He is a person who feels the burden of responsibility at all times; he regards the world as a place of test, and the life as the limited time allowed for the test. This feeling makes him behave seriously and responsibly throughout life just like the student who is taking an examination paper with his whole mind and body and soul absorbed in it. Just as the student knows and feels that each moment of the limited time at his disposal is important and decisive for his future life, and is not inclined to waste it, so the Believer also spends each moment of his life on works which are useful and productive in their ultimate results. So much so that even in matters of recreation and sport, he makes a choice of only those things which prepare him for higher ends in life and do not result in mere wastage of time. For him time is not something to be killed but used profitably and productively.  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">Besides this, the Believer is a person who possesses a right thinking mind, pure nature and fine taste: he has no inclination to indecent things: he can talk useful and healthy things but cannot indulge in idle talk: he has a fine taste of humor, but is not given to jesting, joking, ridicule, etc. nor can he endure dirty jokes and fun. For him a society in which the ears are never immune from abusive language, back-biting, slander; lying, dirty songs and indecent talk is a source of torture and agony. A characteristic of the promised Paradise is: &quot;therein you will not hear anything vain or useless.&quot;   </P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote5\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote5sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote5anc\">5</A>The word Zakat literally means purification and development-to help something grow tip smoothly and develop without obstruction. As an Islamic term, it implies both the portion of wealth taken out for the purpose of purifying the rest of wealth and the act of purification itself. The words of the original Text mean that the Believer constantly practices purification. Thus the meaning is not confined to the paying off of Zakat dues only but it is extended to self-purification which includes purification of morals as well as wealth, property and life in general. Then it does not mean purification of one's own self, but includes the purification of the lives of other people as well. So the verse means: &quot;The Believers are the people who purify themselves as well as others.&quot; This thing has been stated at other places in the Qur'an -also, for instance: &quot;Successful is he who practiced -purification and remembered his Lord and prayed.&quot; (LXXXVII: 1415), and: &quot;Successful is he who purified himself and failure is he who corrupted it.&quot; (XCI: 9-10). But this verse is more comprehensive in meaning because it stresses the purification of both society and one's own person.</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote6\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote6sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote6anc\">6</A>They are modest in every sense of the word. They are free from sex abuse and sex perversion. They are so modest that they even conceal those parts of their bodies which the Law forbids to expose before others. For explanation, see E.N.'s 30 and 32 of An-Nur (XXIV).</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote7\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote7sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote7anc\">7</A>This is a parenthesis which is meant to remove the common misunderstanding that sex desire is an evil thing in itself and satisfying it even in lawful ways is not desirable, particularly for the righteous and godly people. This misunderstanding would have been strengthened had it been only said that the Believers guard their private parts scrupulously, because it would have implied that they live unmarried lives, away from the world, like monks and hermits. Therefore a parenthesis has been added to say that there is nothing wrong in satisfying the sex desire in lawful ways. What is evil is that one should transgress the prescribed limits for satisfying the sex desire.</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">Here are briefly a few injunctions which are based on this parenthetical clause:  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(1) Two categories of women have been excluded from the general command of guarding the private parts: (a) wives, (b) women who are legally in ode's possession, i.e. slave-girls. Thus the verse clearly lays down the law that one is allowed to have sexual relations with one's slave-girl as with one's wife. the basis being possession and not marriage. If marriage had been the condition, the slave-girl also would have been included among the wives, and there was no need to mention them separately. Some modern commentators, who dispute the permissibility of having sexual relations with the slave-girl, argue from An-Nisa' (IV) : 25 to prove that one can have sexual relations with a slave-girl only after entering wedlock with her, because that verse enjoins that if a person cannot afford to marry a free Muslim woman, he may marry a Muslim slave-girl. But these commentators have a strange characteristic: they accept a part of a verse if it suits them, but conveniently ignore another part of the same verse if it goes against their wish and whim. The law about marrying the slave-girls as enunciated in IV :25 reads: &quot;....you may marry them with the permission of their guardians and give them their fair dowries.&quot; Obviously the person under reference here is not the master of the slave girl himself but the person who cannot afford to marry a free Muslim woman, and therefore , wants to marry a slave-girl, who is in the possession of another person. For if the question had been of marrying one's own slave-girl, who would then be the &quot;guardian&quot; whose permission would have to be sought? Then, the interpretation they give of this verse contradicts other verses dealing with the same subject in the Qur'an. A sincere person who wants to understand the Qur'anic law in this regard should study An-Nisa' (IV); 3, 25; AI-Ahzab (XXXIII): S0, 52, and Al-Ma`arij (LXX): 30 together with this verse of Al-Mu'minun. (For further explanation, see E.N. 44 of An-Nisa).  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(2) The law prescribed in the parenthesis is only applicable to men as is clear from the Text. A woman in the time of Hadrat `Umar did not understand this fine point of the language and indulged in sexual gratification with her slave. When her case was brought before the consultative body of the Companions, they gave the unanimous decision: &quot;She misinterpreted the Book of Allah&quot; Nobody should entertain the doubt that if this exception is meant for the men only, how could then the husbands become lawful for the wives? This doubt is unjustified because when the husbands are exempted from the command of guarding their private parts in regard to their wives, the wives automatically stand exempted from the command with regard to their husbands, and there is no nerd to grant them exemption separately. Thus the command of exemption remains applicable and effective only in respect of the man and the woman legally in his possession, and the slave becomes unlawful for the woman possessing him. The wisdom of why the slave has been forbidden to the woman is that he can only satisfy her sexual desire but cannot become guardian and governor of herself and her household, which leaves a serious flaw in the family life.  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(3) The sentence &quot;.... but those who go beyond this (in lust for sexual desire), shall be transgressors&quot; has made satisfaction of sex desire in other ways unlawful, whether it be through fornication, homosexuality, sex gratification with animals, or some other means. The jurists differ only with regard to masturbation. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal regards it as lawful, but Imams Malik and Shafi`i regard it as absolutely unlawful: and though the Hanafites also regard it as unlawful, they give the opinion that if a person indulges sometimes in masturbation under the fit of passion, it is expected that he will be forgiven the error.  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(4) Some commentators have proved the prohibition of Mut ah (temporary marriage) from this verse. They argue that the &quot;woman with whom one has entered into wedlock temporarily, can neither be regarded as a Wife nor a slave-girl. A slave-girl obviously she is not, and she is also not a wife, because the legal injunctions normally applicable to the wife are not applicable to her. She neither inherits the man nor the man her; she is neither governed by the law pertaining to `Iddah (waiting period after divorce or death of husband), divorce, subsistence, nor by that pertaining to the vow by man that he will not have conjugal relations with her, false accusation, etc. She is also excluded from the prescribed limit of four wives. Thus, when she is neither a &quot;wife&quot; nor a &quot;slave-girl&quot; in any sense, she will naturally be included among those &quot;beyond this&quot;, whose seeker has been declared a &quot;transgressor&quot; by the Qur'an.  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">This is a strong argument but due to a weakness in it,-it is difficult to say that this verse is decisive with regard to the prohibition of Mut`ah. The fact is that the Holy Prophet enjoined the final and absolute prohibition of Mut ah in the year of the conquest of Makkah, but before it Mut ah was allowed according to several authentic traditions. If Mut 'ah had been prohibited in this verse, which was admittedly revealed at Makkah, several years before the migration, how can it be imagined that the Holy Prophet kept the prohibition in abeyance till the conquest of Makkah? The correct position therefore is that prohibition of Mut ah is not based on any express law of the Qur'an but is based on the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet. Had it not beep prohibited by the Sunnah, it would have been difficult to declare it as prohibited only on the authority of this verse.  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">It would be worth-while to clarify two other points in connection with Mut'ah: (a) lts prohibition is based on the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet and therefore it is wrong to say that it was prohibited by Hadrat 'Umar. As a matter of fact, Hadrat `Umar only enforced it as a law of Islam and publicised it among the people. This had not been done earlier because the Holy Prophet had forbidden Mut 'ah only during the latter part of his worldly life.  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(b) The Shiite view that Mut ah is absolutely lawful and permissible has no sanction and support in the Qur'an or Sunnah. The fact is that a few of the Companions, their followers and jurists who regarded it permissible in the early days of Islam, did so only in case of extreme necessity and need. None of them held the view that it was absolutely lawful like marriage and could be practised in normal circumstances. Hadrat `Abdullah bin 'Abbas, who is generally cited as a prominent supporter of the view of permissibility, has himself explained his position thus: &quot;It is just like carrion which is lawful for a person only in extreme necessity.&quot; Even Hadrat Ibn 'Abbas had to revise his opinion when he saw that people were abusing permissibility and had started practising Mut ah freely regardless of genuine need and necessity. Again, even if the question, whether Hadrat Ibn '.Abbas and the few likeminded jurists had revised their opinion or not, is ignored, the fact is that the supporters of Mut'ah allow it only in case of extreme necessity. Holding Mut ah as absolutely permissible, practising it without any real necessity, or resorting to it even when one has a legally wedded wife or wives is a kind of licence which is abhorred by good taste, much less it be attributed to the Shari ah of Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) and imputed to the learned jurists of his family. I think that among the Shiite Muslims themselves no respectable person would like that somebody should ask for the hand of his daughter or sister not in marriage but for the purpose of Mutah. For if Mutah is held as absolutely permissible, it would imply that there should exist in society a low class of women, like the prostitutes, who should be available for the purpose as and when required, or if not that, Mutah be restricted to the daughters and sisters of the poor stratum of society and the well-to-do be given the freedom and right to exploit them as and when they like. Can such an injustice and discrimination be expected of the Divine Law? And will Allah and His Messenger permit an act which every respectable woman would regard not only disgraceful for herself but shameful, too?  </P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote8\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote8sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote8anc\">8</A>The Believers fulfill the terms of the trusts which are placed in their charge. In this connection it should be noted that the Arabic word amanat is very comprehensive and includes all those trusts which are placed in their charge by Allah or society or individuals. Likewise `ahd includes all those compacts, pledges, and promises which are made between Allah and man, and man and man. The Holy Prophet himself used to impress the importance of the fulfillment of pledges in his addresses: &quot;The one, who does not fulfil the terms of his trust, has no Faith, and the one, who does not keep promises and pledges has no Islam. &quot; (Baihaqi) According to a Tradition reported both by Bukhari and Muslim, he said: Four characteristics are such that if a person has all the four in him, he is beyond any doubt a hypocrite, and the one who has one of these, is a hypocrite to that extent till he gives it up:  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(a) When something is placed in his trust, he commits breach of the trust,  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(b) when he speaks, he tells a lie,  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(c) when he makes a promise, he breaks it, and</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(d) when he has a quarrel with somebody, he exceeds all limits (of decency and morality)&quot;</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote9\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote9sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote9anc\">9</A>Salawat is plural of Salat. In verse 2 the act of Salat itself was implied, but here the plural number implies the individual Prayers offered in their own times. &quot;They strictly guard their Prayers&quot;: they strictly adhere to the prescribed times of the Prayers: they perform them with due regard for their pre-requisites, conditions and articles with clean body and dress and necessary ablutions: they do not regard their Prayers as an unnecessary burden, which has to be cast off somehow: they do not recite mechanically but understand what they recite and are conscious that they are supplicating their Lord like humble servants.</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote10\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote10sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote10anc\">10</A>Firdaus (Paradise) is a common word found in almost all human languages in very nearly similar forms. It means a vast garden adjoining the dwelling of a person and enclosed by defence walls and containing all kinds of fruit trees, especially vines: In some languages, the word has the sense of containing pet birds and animals, too. Firdaus was in common use in pre-Islamic Arabic literature. The Qur'an, however, has used it for a plurality of gardens as in Al-Kahf (XVIII) :107. This gives the idea that Firdaus is a vast place containing a great number of gardens, vineyards, etc.  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">The inheritance of Paradise by Believers has been explained in detail in E.N. 83 of Surah Ta Ha (XX) and E.N. 99 of Surah Al-Anbiya' (XXI).</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote11\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote11sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote11anc\">11</A>The substance of this passage may be summed up in four parts for the further understanding of the Surah:  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(1) The above-mentioned excellent qualities of the Believers are not confined to any race, nation or country.  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(2) These excellences can be attained only by sincere Faith and excellent moral qualities, and by the observance of prescribed laws in all the aspects of life.  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(3) True success is not confined to transitory worldly and material prosperity but it comprises both success in this life and in the life after death in the Hereafter, and is attained by sincere Faith and righteous deeds. This is a fundamental principle which cannot be falsified either by the worldly &quot;success&quot; of the evil-doers or by the temporary &quot;failure&quot; of the righteous people.  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(4) Let us reiterate that these excellent characteristics of the Believers have been presented as a practical proof of the truth of the Message of the Holy Prophet, for these were the result of its acceptance. This should be kept in mind in the study of the succeeding passages, wherein the same subject has been pursued from different angles. This will also help to show the connection between this and the succeeding passages.</P> </DIV> \\n\\t\\t\\t</note>"

They think that sincerity and selflessness can be employed only to deceive people and these cannot be put to any better use. That is why the epithet of &quot;power hungry&quot; for the reformers in all ages has been used by those already in power as if their own power and domination in the land was their birth-right, and they were in no way blame-worthy for struggling for it and achieving it.

This verse is a clear proof that a son was born to Mary without cohabitation with a man and that Jesus had no father.

But the deviation in regard to Prophet Jesus and his mother was that the credulous people raised them from the low position of human beings to the high rank of Godhead.

However, it does not mean that they were present at one and the same place at the time of address. As a matter of fact, this way of address has been adopted to show that the Message of all the Messengers, who came to different countries in different ages, was the same and they all belonged to one and the same community. (v. 52). Therefore the Message to one Messenger was meant to be the Message for each one of them. In this verse, they have been addressed together as if they were present at one and the same place in order to emphasize this same aspect of the matter. But it is an irony that some stupid people of this age have concluded that this verse has been addressed to those messengers who were to come after Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him).

The Holy Prophet impressed this very thing, saying, &quot;O people, Allah is pure and loves pure things.&quot; Then he recited this verse (51) and said, &quot;A person makes a long pilgrimage in a disheveled condition and prays with raised hands, `O my Lord, O my Lord', whereas he eats unlawful food, wears unlawful clothes and has been brought up on unlawful provisions.

The argument is this: Islam has been the real and original religion of all the Prophets from Noah to Jesus (Allah's peace be upon them all), because all of them brought and taught the same doctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter. On the contrary, all the other religions are the perversions of &quot;the real and original religion&quot;, which has been tampered with in many ways.

His people had seen the practical results of the acceptance of his Message and had witnessed his own high character which was by itself a guarantee that he was a trustworthy man.

It is meant to remove their misconception of &quot;success&quot;, &quot;welfare&quot; and &quot;prosperity&quot;, which the disbelievers had formed to delude themselves. According to them, the one, who enjoyed the good things of life and wielded power and influence in the society, had attained &quot;success&quot;. On the other hand, the one who was deprived of these things was a &quot;failure&quot; . This misconception had involved &quot; them in another serious misunderstanding. They thought that the one who had attained &quot;success&quot; was in the right, and the beloved of Allah. Otherwise, how could he have attained all the &quot;successes&quot;? On the contrary, the one who was apparently deprived of these things was surely wrong in his creed and erroneous in his deeds, and was under the wrath of God (or gods). As this misconception is one of the greatest deviations of the materialists, the Qur'an has stated it and refuted it in different ways at different places and made the reality plain. For instance, see A1-Baqarah (II): 126, 212, Al-A'araf (VII): 32, At-Taubah (IX): 55, 69, 85, Yunus (X):17, Hud (XI) :3, 27-31, 38-39, Ar-Ra`d (XIII): 26, Al-Kahf (XVIII): 28, 32-43, 103-105, Maryam (XIX):77-80, Ta Ha (XX): 131-132, Al-Anbiya` (XXI) :44 along with the relevant E.N.'s. In order to remove the above-mentioned misconceptions one should keep in view the following:  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(1) &quot;Success&quot; is a far higher thing than the material prosperity and the transitory success of an individual, community or nation  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(2) It is absolutely wrong to consider &quot;prosperity&quot; and &quot;success&quot; as a criterion of truth and falsehood.  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(3) It should be noted well that this world is a place of test and trial and not a place of reward and retribution. It is true that even in this world, sometimes there is some punishment or reward, but it is on a very limited scale, and even in this, there is an aspect of the test. Therefore it is an utter folly to consider material &quot;success&quot; and &quot;prosperity&quot; to be a proof that the recipient is in the right and so the beloved of the Lord, and vice versa. Moreover, the tests and trials of individuals and communities are of many varieties and a seeker after truth must understand at the outset that the worldly &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot; of the people is not the result of ultimate reward or punishment and cannot be regarded as the criterion for the right or wrong creed, morals and actions and a sign of being the beloved of God or otherwise.'  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(4) One must have a firm belief that truth and righteousness will ultimately gain victory over falsehood and wickedness. As regards the criterion of truth and falsehood and right and wrong, one must judge this in the light of Revelations and teachings of the Messengers, because common sense confirms the same, and it is also supported by the general conception which mankind has always had of good and evil.  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">(5) As a corollary of the above, it would have become clear that according to the Qur'an (and this is confirmed by common sense), the conception of &quot;reward&quot; and &quot;punishment&quot; should also be different from the common one. For instance, if a wicked person or community is enjoying &quot;prosperity&quot;, it is not a reward of its evil deeds but a harder test for it, and it is not a blessing but the wrath of Allah. It means that Allah has decided to punish the &quot;prosperous people&quot; with a severe scourge. On the other hand, if the righteous people are suffering from hardships and afflictions, it is not a punishment from Allah but a blessing in disguise to pass them through the &quot;fire&quot; to remove impurity, if any, from the pure gold. If this hard trial is a blessing for the righteous people, it is a test for the wicked people to give them a severe punishment for the persecution of the former.</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote54\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote54sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote54anc\">51</A>That is, they do not live a carefree life devoid of the fear of God.

Although he served his Allah in a way that was exemplary, yet he was so afraid of accountability to Him that he is reported to have said before death: &quot;f shall consider it a favor, if I am neither rewarded nor punished in the Hereafter.&quot; Hadrat Hasan Basri has expressed the same thing in a beautiful manner: &quot;A believer obeys Allah and is yet fearful of Him, and a hypocrite disobeys Allah and is yet fearless of Him.&quot;</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote58\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote58sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote58anc\">55</A>The enunciation of this fundamental proposition, in the context in which it occurs, is very meaningful.

And they themselves testified to all this before he claimed to be a Messenger of Allah. Then he has been consistently preaching the same Message from the first day of his Mission. Then whatever he has preached he has first practiced it himself and demonstrated its truth: there has been no contradiction between his word and deed: he and his followers have faithfully and honestly put into practice the Message of the Qur'an and shown excellent results.&quot; For further details, see E.N. 21 of AI-An'am (Vl), E.N. 21 of Yunus (X) and E.N. 105 of Bani Isra'il (XVII).</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote70\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote70sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote70anc\">67</A>That is, &quot;Do they reject his Message because they regard Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) to be possessed by a jinn?

Nay, he had staked his business, reputation, peaceful home life, relationships with the unbelieving kindred for the success of his Mission and was being ruthlessly persecuted for its sake. A selfish person could not have risked his all for the sake of only worldly motives. He would rather have exploited the racial and tribal prejudices of his people to become their ruler and leader. On the contrary, his Message not only cut at the root of those prejudices but tended to destroy the very bases which helped his tribe to wield influence and authority over the polytheists of Arabia. This is an argument which the Qur'an has advanced again and again as a proof of the truth of the Mission of the other Prophets as well.
