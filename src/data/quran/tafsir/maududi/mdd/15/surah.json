First, it appears from the repeated warnings in this Surah that in spite of the fact that the Holy Prophet had been propagating the Message for many years, his people in general had not shown any inclination towards its acceptance nay, they had become more and more obdurate and stubborn in their antagonism, enmity and ridicule with the passage of time. Secondly, by that time the Holy Prophet had begun to feel a little tired of making strenuous efforts to eradicate disbelief and opposition of his people. That is why Allah has consoled and comforted him over and over again by way of encouragement.  </P> <H2><B>Topics and the Central Theme</B></H2> <P> Though the main topics of the surah are:  </P> <OL>\\n<LI>\\n<P> warning to those who rejected his Message, opposed it tooth and nail, and ridiculed him, and  </P> </LI>\\n<LI>\\n<P> comfort and encouragement to the Holy Prophet,</P> </LI>\\n</OL> <P>\\n<SPAN>It does not mean that this Surah does not contain admonition and instructions.

Now in vv.16-22, some of the Signs arc being cited in order to convince there of its truth.</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">&quot;Fortified spheres&quot; (buruj) are Signs of Allah for it is not possible to pass through one sphere of the Heaven into another, as each sphere of the space has been fortified by invisible boundaries. In this connection, it may be noted that literally the Arabic word burj means &quot;a fortified place&quot; but as a technical term of ancient astronomy this stood for each of the twelve Signs of the Zodiac, which marked the sun's path through the heavens. This has led some of the commentators to form the opinion that in this verse the word buruj refers to the same. But there are some others who think that it means &quot;planets&quot;. However, if we consider this word in the context of v. 19, we are led to the conclusion that probably it stands for &quot;spheres&quot;.</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote9\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote9sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote9anc\">9</A>&quot;We have adorned and decked the &quot;fortified spheres&quot;: &quot;We have placed a shining star or planet in each of these spheres and made them look beautiful&quot;. In other words, it means; &quot;We have not made the boundless universe dismal, desolate and frightful, but so beautiful that one finds marvelous order and harmony in it everywhere, and sights therein are. so attractive that each one of these charms hearts and minds. This wonderful structure of the universe is a clear proof of the fact that its Creator is not only Great and All-Wise but is also a perfect Artist&quot;. The Qur'an has also stated this aspect of the Creator in XXXII: 7: &ldquo;(Allah is) that God Who has created in perfect beauty everything He has created.&rdquo;</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote10\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote10sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote10anc\">10</A>That is, &quot;These spheres are so fortified that they are beyond the reach of every Satan, for all Satans including those of jinns, have been confined to that sphere in which the Earth has been placed and they enjoy no more access to visit other spheres than the other dwellers of this sphere. This has been mentioned in order to remove a common misunderstanding. The common people believed, .and still believe, that Satan and his descendants have a free access to every place in the universe. On the contrary, the Qur'an says that Satans cannot go beyond a certain limit and they have no unlimited power of ascension.</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote11\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote11sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote11anc\">11</A>This is the answer to the false claim of the soothsayers, diviners, hermits, conjurers and the like who pretended to receive communications from the Heaven. The Qur'an says that in fact they do not possess any means of obtaining information about unseen things. Satans, however, try to eaves-drop because they are by nature more like angels than human beings, but in reality, they succeed in obtaining very little information about it.</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote12\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote12sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote12anc\">12</A>In Arabic the word shihab-i-mubin literally means &quot;fiery flame&quot;. In XXXVII: 10, the same thing has been called shihab-i-thaqib (&quot;flame that pierces through darkness&quot;). 'This may or may not necessarily be a &quot;meteor&quot; for it is just possible that it may be some type of rays such as &quot;Cosmic Rays&quot; or even a stronger type which we have not been able to discover as yet. Anyhow if the &quot;fiery flame&quot; that pursues Satans may be taken to be a meteor, a countless number of these can form a fortification around our sphere of the universe. Scientific observations made with the help of the telescope have shown that billions of these meteors are rushing from space in mass of &quot;rainfall&quot; towards the earth's atmosphere. Such a scene was witnessed in an eastern pan of North America on November 13, 1833. This is so strong a fortification that it can prevent Satans from passing through any fortified sphere.</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">With the help of the above, one can form a mental picture of the &quot;fortified spheres&quot; . Though there is no visible &quot;wall&quot; to keep distinct and separate one sphere from the others, Allah has securely guarded each of these spheres by invisible &quot;walls&quot; against each other. That is why our &quot;planet&quot; has remained safe in spite of the occasional &quot;rainfall&quot; of countless meteors. For as soon as they cross the protective wall of our sphere, they are burnt to ashes. But sometimes a meteorite reaches the earth from outer space as if to warn the dwellers of this planet of the existence of the &quot;power&quot; of the Creator. For instance, the biggest of these weighs 645 pounds and it is obvious from this that if the earth had not been made safe and secure by means of &quot;fortified spheres&quot; the rain of the shooting stars would have utterly annihilated it long long ago. It is these &quot;fortified spheres&quot; which the Qur'an calls &quot;buruj.&quot;</P> </DIV> \\n\\t\\t\\t</note>"

And it is this Divine reflection on the human body which has raised him to the position of the Vicegerent of Allah and made him that worthy being before whom angels and every earthly thing should bow down.  </P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">As a matter of fact, the source of each characteristic of everything is one Divine characteristic or the other, as is borne by a Tradition: &ldquo;Allah divided Mercy into one hundred parts: then He reserved ninety-nine parts for Himself and sent down the remaining one part to the Earth. It is because of that one part that the creatures show mercy to one another. So much so that it is due to this that an animal refrains from placing the hoof on its young ones.&rdquo;</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">In this connection one has to be on strict guard against the notion that the possession of a part of any Divine characteristic amounts to the possession of a part of Godhead.

However, We will give freedom of action to those who will willingly or deliberately follow you, and we will not forcibly prevent them from your way, if they intended to follow you.&quot;</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">According to the first rendering, these verses will mean this: &quot;The way followed by My sincere servants is the only straight way to reach Me. Satan will have no power over those people who follow it, for I will choose them to be My own servants.&quot; Satan himself admitted that he will not be able to entice them. On the contrary, he will succeed in beguiling those people, who themselves will deviate from the way of obedience. They will then wander farther and farther away following his temptations and allurements.</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">According to the second meaning, the passage will mean this: &quot;When Satan challenged that he would beguile people from the Way of Allah by making this worldly life very tempting to them, Allah accepted his challenge but made it clear to him that he was being allowed only to beguile people with temptation, but was not being given any power to force them to deviate from the Right Way. At this, Satan clarified that his challenge did not apply to those people whom Allah will choose for Himself. As this exception might have led to a misunderstanding that Allah may choose any people for Himself to keep them safe and secure from the reach of Satan, Allah clarified it, saying &quot;Only that person will follow you, who himself will deviate from the Right Way. &quot; As a corollary to this, &quot;That person, who will not deviate from the Right Way will not follow you, and will, thus become Our servant, whom We will choose for Our-self.&quot;</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote25\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote25sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote25anc\">25</A>In order to comprehend the purpose for which the story of Prophet Adam and Satan has been related here, we should keep in mind the context in which this has occurred. In the preceding verses (1-25), it has been stated that the disbelievers were following the ways of deviation that would lead them to perdition. This story has been related to warn them that the ways they were following were the ways of Satan, their eternal enemy, so as to say, &quot;You should realize the consequences of following Satan, who has enticed you in this snare, and is leading you to the lowest depths of degradation because of this enmity and envy. In contrast to this, Our Prophet is doing his utmost w free you from his snare and lead you to the height of success, which as a man you should desire to achieve. But it is a pity that you are regarding your enemy (Satan) as your friend, and your friend (Our ) as your enemy.&quot;</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">Secondly, the story also makes quite clear to them this thing:</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">&quot;There is only one way of salvation and that is the Way of obedience to Allah. If you discard this Way, every other way will be a way of Satan which will take you directly to Hell.&quot;</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">Than this story is meant to bring home to them this fact: You yourselves are responsible for your wrong deeds and not Satan; for, the most he can do is to beguile you from the obedience of Allah and hold temptations before you It is therefore, your own concern and responsibility to be beguiled or not to be beguiled by Satan. &quot; \\t</P> </DIV> \\n\\t\\t\\t</note>"

No sooner did they hear the news of the arrival of handsome strangers in their town than they rushed rejoicing to the house of Prophet Lot and impudently demanded that he should hand over his guests to them for the gratification of their lust. The pity is that there had remained not a single person among them to make a protest against such a heinous sin. Moreover, this shows that all of them, as a community, had totally lost every sense of decency, and they felt no shame at all to make such a wicked demand on him openly. The very fact, that they felt no hesitation in making such a wicked demand brazen- facedly from a pious and holy man like Prophet Lot, shows that the heinous crime was so common among them that they would not spare anyone.</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">The Talmud records many instances of the all-round moral degradation of the people of Lot. Once a stranger was passing through their territory. He was forced by coming darkness to pass the night near Sodom. As he had his own provisions with him, he did not stand in any need of help from the towns-folk; so he lay under a tree to pass the night. But a Sodomite entreated him to accompany him to his house. During the night he did away with the ass and merchandise of the stranger. When he began to cry for help in the morning, the towns-folk came there not to help him but to rob him of what had been left with him.</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">On one occasion Hadrat Sarah sent her slave to Sodom to inquire after Prophet Lot's household. When the slave entered the town, he saw that a Sodomite was beating a stranger. Naturally the slave of Hadrat Sarah tried to rouse his sense of decency, saying, &quot;why do you ill-treat helpless strangers like this?&quot; In answer to this appeal, his head was broken in public.</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">On another occasion a poor man happened to come to Sodom but no one gave him anything to eat. When he was half dead with starvation, he fell to the ground in a helpless plight. A daughter of Prophet Lot saw him and sent some food for him. At this the Sodomites reproached Prophet Lot and his daughter and threatened to expel them from there, if they would not refrain from such &quot;deeds&quot;!</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">After citing several similar incidents, the Talmud says that those people had become so cruel, so deceitful and so dishonest in their dealings that no traveler could pass safe through their territory nor could a poor person expect any food or help from them. Many a time it so happened that a poor stranger came there, and died from hunger. Then they would strip the clothes from his body and bury him naked! If a foreigner committed the blunder of visiting their territory, they would publicly rob him of everything, and make fool of him if he appealed to them to redress the wrong. Then they would openly commit shameless deeds in the gardens which they had grown in their valley because there was none to rebuke them except Prophet Lot. The Quran has summed up the whole of their wicked story in two concise sentences:(1) &quot;.They had already been committing very wicked deeds&quot; XI: 78, and (2) &quot;You gratify your lust with males: you rob travelers, and you commit wicked deeds publicly in your assemblies.&quot;</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote40\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote40sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote40anc\">40</A>In E.N. 87 of Surah Hud, it has been explained what Prophet Lot meant by this. It may also be added that such words as these were uttered by an honorable man like him in the last resort, when all his entreaties and earnest requests had failed to prevent those people from their evil designs towards his guests.</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">Here it will be worthwhile to clear the significance of the words which were uttered by Prophet Lot as they occur in Surah Hud (v. 78). When he entreated those wicked people not to molest his guests, saying, &quot;Here are my daughters....&quot;, he was unaware that his guests were angels in the disguise of handsome boys. The angels revealed their identity only when the wicked crowd gathered at the residence of his guests and began to threaten them with their wicked designs, and Prophet Lot began to lament, &quot;I wish I had the power to set you right or I could find some strong support for refuge.&quot; It was then that the angels revealed themselves, saying, &quot;We are envoys sent by your Lord.... &quot; This sequence of events shows that Prophet Lot had made that &quot;offer&quot; only when he had felt to be utterly helpless.</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">It is very important to keep this in view because the sequences of events in this Surah is different from that in Surah Hud. One is liable to have a misunderstanding as to why Prophet Lot wailed and lamented when he knew all the while that his guests were angels and could defend themselves against those wicked people.</P> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">As regards the apparent difference between the two sequences, it may be pointed out that here the important thing to be stated is that the angels come with the truth. Therefore that part of the story (vv. 61-66) has been related first in order to make the point more prominent.  </P> </DIV> \\n\\t\\t\\t</note>"

Such an assurance was urgently needed because at that tithe falsehood appeared to be triumphant over the Truth. This implies, &quot;O Prophet, do not worry at all at the apparent &quot;success&quot; of falsehood for this is temporary. Likewise the difficulties, the obstacles and the troubles in the way of truth are not permanent. Take courage, and have confidence in the cause of the Truth and you will triumph over falsehood because the whole system of the universe is akin to truth and averse to falsehood.

Though some of the commentators are of the view that this &ldquo;Al-Mathani,&rdquo; refers to the seven Surahs which contain two hundred or more verses, that is, II-VII and (VIII-IX) or X.

In order to grasp the full significance of this, one should keep in view the fact that at that time the Holy Prophet and his Companions were suffering badly from poverty. The trading activities of the Holy Prophet had almost come to an end during the period in which he had been engaged in his Mission. Besides this, he had almost used up the whole wealth of Hadrat Khaijah. As regards his Companions, some of the young men had been turned out of their homes and reduced to poverty. The economic boycott had mined the business of those who were engaged in trade. There were others who were mere slaves or proteges of the Quraish and had no economic position whatever. In addition to their sad economic plight, all the Muslims, along with the Holy Prophet, were suffering persecution from the people of Makkah and its surroundings, In short, they were so much persecuted, ridiculed and insulted that no one of them was safe from physical and mental torture. On the other side, the Quraish, their opponents and persecutors, enjoyed all the good things of this world, and lived lives of happiness and luxury. This is the background of the reassurance given to the Believers, as if to say, &quot;Why should you feel disheartened at this? We have given you &quot;wealth&quot; which surpasses all kinds of worldly riches. Therefore, your opponents should envy your knowledge and high morals; you need not envy their ill-canned wealth and their wicked enjoyments, for when they will go before their Lord, they themselves will find that they had not brought such wealth as carries any value there. &quot; \\t</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote51\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote51sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote51anc\">51</A>That is, &quot;Do not grieve that they consider you as their enemy, though you .are their sincere well-wisher; that they regard their vices as their virtues; that they are not only themselves following but leading their followers on that way which inevitably leads to destruction: nay, they are doing their worst to oppose the reformative efforts of the one who is showing them the way of peace.&quot;</P> </DIV> \\n<DIV ID=\"sdfootnote52\"> <P CLASS=\"sdfootnote-western\">\\n<A CLASS=\"sdfootnotesym\" NAME=\"sdfootnote52sym\" HREF=\"#sdfootnote52anc\">52</A>The schismatics were the Jews for they had split their religion into many parts and caused division in it.
