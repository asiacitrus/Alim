He\n\t\t\tknoweth that there are sick folk among you, while others travel\n\t\t\tin the land in search of Allah\u0027s bounty, and others (still) are\n\t\t\tfighting for the cause of Allah. So recite of it that which is\n\t\t\teasy (for you), and establish worship and pay the poor due and\n\t\t\t(so) lend unto Allah a goodly loan. Whatsoever good ye send\n\t\t\tbefore you for your souls, ye will surely find it with Allah,\n\t\t\tbetter and greater in the recompense. And seek forgiveness of\n\t\t\tAllah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."
