    "Body": "Cf. xliv. 3 and n. 4690. The 23rd, 25th or 27th night of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRamadhan, as well as other nights, have been suggested as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Night of Power. See, however, the Introduction to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Sura. It is best to take this in conjunction with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse 3 below, which says that the Night of Power is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetter than a thousand Months. It transcends Time: for it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis Allah's Power dispelling the Darkness of Ignorance, by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Revelation, in every kind of affair."

    "Body": "\"A thousand\" must be taken in an indefinite sense; as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdenoting a very long period of time. Cf. notes 3632 and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t3634 to xxxii. 4-5, and n. 5678 to lxx. 4. This does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefer to our ideas of time, but to \"timeless Time\". One\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmoment of enlightenment under Allah's Light is better\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan thousands of months or years of animal life, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch a moment converts the night of darkness into a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod of spiritual glory."

And this lasts on until this life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcloses, and the glorious Day of the new world dawns, when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teverything will be on a different plane, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchequered nights and days of this world will be even less\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan a dream."
