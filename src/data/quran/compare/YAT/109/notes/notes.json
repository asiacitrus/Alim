    "Body": "Faith is a matter of personal conviction, and does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdepend on worldly motives. Worship should depend on pure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand sincere Faith, but often does not: for motives of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworldly gain, ancestral custom, social conventions or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timitative instincts, or a lethargic instinct to shrink\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom enquiring into the real significance of solemn acts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the motives behind them, reduce a great deal of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld's worship to sin, selfishness, or futility.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSymbolic idols may themselves be merely instruments for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsafeguarding the privileges of a selfish priestly class,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor the ambitions, greed, or lust of private individuals.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHence the insistence of Islam and its Prophet on the pure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworship of the One True God. The Prophet firmly resisted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall appeals to worldly motives, and stood firm to his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessage of eternal Unity."

    "Body": "Verses 2-3 describe the conditions as they were at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime when this Sura was revealed, and may be freely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparaphrased: 'I am a worshipper of the One True God, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLord of all, of you as well as of myself; but you on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccount of your vested interests have not the will to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgive up your false worship, of idols and self'. Verses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t4-5 describe the psychological reasons: I, being a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprophet of Allah do not and cannot possibly desire to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollow your false ancestral ways; and you, as custodians\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the false worship, have not the will to give up your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tways of worship, which are wrong'. The \"will\" in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttranslation represents less the future tense than the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill, the desire, the psychological possibility: it tries\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto reproduce the Arabic noun-agent."

For your ways the responsibility is yours:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI have shown you the Truth. For my ways the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponsibility is mine: you have no right to ask me to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabandon the Truth. Your persecutions will be vain: the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTruth must prevail in the end'. This was the attitude of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFaith then: but it is true for all time. Hold fast to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTruth, \"in scorn of consequence\"."
