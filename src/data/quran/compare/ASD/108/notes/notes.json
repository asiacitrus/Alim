In the above context, which is the sole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance of its use in the Qur'an, al-kawthar obviously\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelates to the abundant bestowal on the Prophet of all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat is good in an abstract, spiritual sense, like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation, knowledge, wisdom, the doing of good works,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand dignity in this world and in the hereafter (Razi);\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith reference to the believers in general, it evidently\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsignifies the ability to acquire knowledge, to do good\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworks, to be kind towards all living beings, and thus to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattain to inner peace and dignity."
