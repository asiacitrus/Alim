My rendering of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnafs, in this context, as \"living entity\" follows the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame reasoning. - As regards the expression zawjaha (\"its\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmate\"), it is to be noted that, with reference to animate\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeings, the term zawj (\"a pair\", \"one of a pair\" or \"a\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmate\") applies to the male as well as to the female\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomponent of a pair or couple; hence, with reference to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thuman beings, it signifies a woman's mate (husband) as\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell as a man's mate (wife). Abu Muslim - as quoted by\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRazi - interprets the phrase \"He created out of it\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(minha) its mate\" as meaning \"He created its mate [i.e.,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits sexual counterpart] out of its own kind (min\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjinsiha)\", thus supporting the view of Muhammad 'Abduh\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treferred to above. The literal translation of minha as\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"out of it\" clearly alludes, in conformity with the text,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the biological fact that both sexes have originated\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom \"one living entity\"."

According to an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretation suggested by 'A'ishah, the Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twidow, this refers to the (hypothetical) case of orphan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgirls whom their guardians might wish to marry without,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, being prepared or able to give them an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappropriate marriage-portion - the implication being that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey should avoid the temptation of committing such an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinjustice and should marry other women instead (cf.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBukhari, Kitab at-Tafsir, as well as Muslim and Nasa'i).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, not all of 'A'ishah's contemporaries subscribed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto her explanation of this verse. Thus, according to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSa'id ibn Jubayr, Qatadah, and other successors of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions, the purport of the above passage is this:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Just as you are, rightly, fearful of offending against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe interests of orphans, you must apply the same careful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsideration to the interests and rights of the women\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom you intend to marry.\" In his commentary on this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassage, Tabari quotes several variants of the above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretation and gives it his unequivocal approval."

It is obvious that the phrase \"two, or\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree, or four: but if you have reason to fear...\", etc.\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis a parenthetic clause relating to both the free women\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned in the first part of the sentence and to female\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslaves - for both these nouns are governed by the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timperative verb \"marry\". Thus, the whole sentence has\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis meaning: \"Marry from among [other] women such as are\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlawful to you, or [from among] those whom you rightfully\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossess - [even] two, or three, or four: but if you have\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason to fear that you might not be able to treat them\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith equal fairness, then [only] one\" - implying that,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tirrespective of whether they are free women or,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toriginally, slaves, the number of wives must not exceed\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfour. It was in this sense that Muhammad 'Abduh\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstood the above verse (see Manar IV, 350). This view\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis, moreover, supported by verse {25} of this surah as\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell as by  24:32 , where marriage with female slaves is\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspoken of. Contrary to the popular view and the practice\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof many Muslims in the past centuries, neither the Qur'an\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnor the life-example of the Prophet provides any sanction\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor sexual intercourse without marriage. As regards the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermission to marry more than one wife (up to the maximum\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof four), it is so restricted by the condition, \"if you\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave reason to fear that you might not be able to treat\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem with equal fairness, then [marry only] one\", as to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake such plural marriages possible only in quite\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texceptional cases and under exceptional circumstances\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(see also the first clause of  24:32  and the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorresponding note [42]). Still, one might ask why the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame latitude has not been given to women as well; but\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe answer is simple. Notwithstanding the spiritual\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfactor of love which influences the relations between man\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand woman, the determinant biological reason for the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsexual urge is, in both sexes, procreation: and whereas a\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twoman can, at one time, conceive a child from one man\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly and has to carry it for nine months before she can\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconceive another, a man can beget a child every time he\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcohabits with a woman. Thus, while nature would have been\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmerely wasteful if it had produced a polygamous instinct\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin woman, man's polygamous inclination is biologically\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjustified. It is, of course, obvious that the biological\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfactor is only one - and by no means always the most\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant - of the aspects of marital love: nonetheless, it is a basic factor and, therefore, decisive in the institution of marriage as such. With the wisdom that\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talways takes human nature fully into account, Islamic Law\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tundertakes no more than the safeguarding of the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsocio-biological function of marriage (which includes\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso care of the progeny), allowing a man to have more\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan one wife and not allowing a woman to have more than\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone husband at one time; while the spiritual problem of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarriage, being imponderable and therefore outside the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscope of law, is left to the discretion of the partners.\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn any event - since marriage in Islam is a purely civil\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontract - recourse to divorce is always open to either\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the two partners. (Regarding the dissolution of a\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarriage at the wife's instance, see surah {2}, note\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[218].)"

This formulation,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, has baffled many a commentator: for, if taken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tliterally, it would imply that wrongful profits from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrading based on mutual agreement are excepted from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeneral prohibition, \"Devour not one another's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossessions wrongfully\" - a supposition impossible to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaintain in view of the ethics postulated by the Qur'an.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTo obviate this difficulty, most of the commentators\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpress the opinion that the particle illa has in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontext the meaning of \"but\", and that the clause ought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto be understood as follows: \"but it is lawful for you to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprofit from one another's possessions by way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlegitimate trade based on mutual agreement\". However,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquite apart from the fact that this interpretation is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thighly laboured and artificial, it does not explain why\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"legitimate trade\" should have been singled out here as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsole means of lawfully deriving economic benefits from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone another - for, as Razi rightly points out in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentary on this verse, \"it is no less lawful to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbenefit economically through a gift, a bequest, a legal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinheritance, alms, a dower, or an indemnity for injuries\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceived: for there are, aside from trade, many ways of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacquiring possessions [lawfully]\". Why, then, should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade alone have been stressed? - and, moreover, stressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin a context not particularly devoted to matters of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade? A really satisfactory answer to this puzzle can,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin my opinion, be obtained only through a linguistic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsideration of the particle illa. Apart from its usual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconnotation of \"except\" or \"unless it be\", it has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsometimes - as has been pointed out in both Qamus and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMughni - the meaning of the simple conjunction \"and\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(wa); similarly, if it is preceded by a negative clause,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit can be synonymous with \"nor\" or \"and neither\" (wa-la):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas, for instance, in {27:10-11}, \"no fear need the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage-bearers have in My Presence, and neither (illa)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneed he who...\", etc. Now if we apply this particular use\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof illa to the passage under consideration, we arrive at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe reading, \"nor [shall you do it] by means of trade\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbased on mutual agreement\", or simply, \"not even by way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof trade based on mutual agreement\" - whereupon the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaning immediately becomes obvious: the believers are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprohibited from devouring another person's possessions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrongfully even if that other person - being the weaker\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparty - agrees to such a deprivation or exploitation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunder the stress of circumstances. The reading adopted by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tme logically connects, moreover, with verse {32}, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmonishes the believers not to covet one another's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossessions."

As regards the prohibition of attempting to pray\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"while in a state of drunkenness\", some of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentators assume that this ordinance represented the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst stage of the total prohibition of intoxicants, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been, consequently, \"abrogated\" by the promulgation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the law of total abstinence from all intoxicants\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t( 5:90 ). However, quite apart from the fact that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoctrine of \"abrogation\" is entirely untenable (see surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t{2}, note [87]), there is no warrant whatever for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregarding the above verse as a \"first step\" which has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome redundant, as it were, after total prohibition was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tordained. It is, of course, true that the Qur'an forbids\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe use of intoxicants at all times, and not merely at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe time of prayer; but since \"man has been created weak\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t( 4:28 ), his lapse from the way of virtue is always a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossibility: and it is to prevent him from adding the sin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof praying while in a state of drunkenness to the sin of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tusing intoxicants as such that the above verse was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpromulgated. Moreover, the expression \"while you are in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate of drunkenness (sukara)\" does not apply exclusively\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto alcoholic intoxication, since the term sukr, in its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twider connotation, signifies any state of mental\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisequilibrium which prevents man from making full use of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this intellectual faculties: that is to say, it can apply\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso to a temporary clouding of the intellect by drugs or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiddiness or passion, as well as to the state\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmetaphorically described as \"drunk with sleep\" - in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrief, to any condition in which normal judgment is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfused or suspended.

In the two instances where this verb\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurs in the Qur'an (in this verse as well as in\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 8:65 ), it has the imperative form: \"Render the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers free of all disquietude of mind\" or tropically,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"of all fear of death\" - and may, thus, be suitably\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpressed as \"inspire the believers to overcome all fear\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof death\".

    "Body": "The term inath (which is the plural of untha, \"a female\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing\") seems to have been applied by the pre-Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabs to their idols, probably because most of them were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsidered to be female. Hence, according to some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tphilologists, the plural form inath signifies \"inanimate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthings\" (cf. Lane I, 112). Ibn 'Abbas, Qatadah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Hasan al Basri explain it as denoting anything that is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassive and lifeless (Tabari); this definition has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadopted by Raghib as well. On the other hand, Tabari\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentions a Tradition, on the authority of 'Urwah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to which a copy of the Qur'an in the possession\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof 'A'ishah contained the word awthan (\"idols\") instead\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof inath (cf. also Zamakhshari and Ibn Kathir). The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trendering \"lifeless symbols\" is most appropriate in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontext inasmuch as it adequately combines the concept of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"idols\" with that of \"inanimate things\"."

    "Body": "Lit., \"His word which He conveyed unto Mary and a soul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Him\". According to Tabari the \"word\" (kalimah) was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"the announcement (risalah) which God bade the angels to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconvey to Mary, and God's glad tiding to her\" (a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treference to  3:45 ) - which justifies the rendering of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkalimatuhu as \"[the fulfilment of] His promise\". (See\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso surah {3}, note [28].) As regards the expression, \"a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsoul from Him\" or \"created by Him\", it is to be noted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat among the various meanings which the word ruh bears\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the Qur'an (e.g., \"inspiration\" in  2:87  and {253]),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is also used in its primary significance of \"breath of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife\", \"soul\", or \"spirit\": thus, for instance, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 32:9 , where the ever-recurring evolution of the human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tembryo is spoken of: \"and then He forms him [i.e.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman]...and breathes into him of His spirit\" - that is,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tendows him with a conscious soul which represents God's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupreme gift to man and is, therefore, described as \"a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreath of His spirit\". In the verse under discussion,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich stresses the purely human nature of Jesus and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefutes the belief in his divinity, the Qur'an points out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Jesus, like all other human beings, was \"a soul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreated by Him\"."

The seemingly abrupt transition from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe preceding passages - dealing with questions of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheology - to this one is in accord with the Qur'anic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprinciple of deliberately interweaving moral exhortation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith practical legislation: and this in pursuance of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteaching that man's life - spiritual and physical,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindividual and social - is one integral whole, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore requires simultaneous consideration of all its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taspects if the concept of \"the good life\" is to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealized.
