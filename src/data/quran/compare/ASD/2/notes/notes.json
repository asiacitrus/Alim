This point has been acutely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrasped by Rashid Rida', who says in his commentary on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe above Qur'anic passage (see Manar I, 345 f.): \"Its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlesson is that one should not pursue one's [legal]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinquiries in such a way as to make laws more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplicated.... This was how the early generations [of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims] visualized the problem. They did not make things\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplicated for themselves - and so, for them, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligious law (din) was natural, simple and liberal in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits straightforwardness. But those who came later added\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto it [certain other] injunctions which they had deduced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby means of their own reasoning (ijtihad); and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmultiplied those [additional] injunctions to such an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textent that the religious law became a heavy burden on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe community.\" For the sociological reason why the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgenuine ordinances of Islamic Law - that is, those which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been prima facie laid down as such in the Qur'an and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe teachings of the Prophet - are almost always devoid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof details, I would refer the reader to my book State and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGovernment in Islam (pp. 11 ff. and passim). The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportance of this problem, illustrated in the above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstory of the cow - and correctly grasped by the Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions - explains why this surah has been entitled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Cow\".

At the root\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the so-called \"doctrine of abrogation\" may lie the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinability of some of the early commentators to reconcile\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone Qur'anic passage with another: a difficulty which was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tovercome by declaring that one of the verses in question\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad been \"abrogated\". This arbitrary procedure explains\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso why there is no unanimity whatsoever among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupholders of the \"doctrine of abrogation\" as to which,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand how many, Qur'an-verses have been affected by it;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand, furthermore, as to whether this alleged abrogation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timplies a total elimination of the verse in question from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe context of the Qur'an, or only a cancellation of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecific ordinance or statement contained in it. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshort, the \"doctrine of abrogation\" has no basis whatever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin historical fact, and must be rejected. On the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thand, the apparent difficulty in interpreting the above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'anic passage disappears immediately if the term ayah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis understood, correctly, as \"message\", and if we read\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis verse in conjunction with the preceding one, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstates that the Jews and the Christians refuse to accept\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany revelation which might supersede that of the Bible:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor, if read in this way, the abrogation relates to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearlier divine messages and not to any part of the Qur'an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\titself."

In other places\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qur'an speaks of it as \"the Ancient Temple\" (al-bayt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-'atiq), and frequently also as \"the Inviolable House\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Worship\" (al-masjid al-haram). Its prototype is said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto have been built by Abraham as the first temple ever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdedicated to the One God (see  3:96 ), and which for this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason has been instituted as the direction of prayer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(qiblah) for all Muslims, and as the goal of the annually\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecurring pilgrimage (hajj). It is to be noted that even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin pre-Islamic times the Ka'bah was associated with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmemory of Abraham, whose personality had always been in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe foreground of Arabian thought. According to very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tancient Arabian traditions, it was at the site of what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlater became Mecca that Abraham, in order to placate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSarah, abandoned his Egyptian bondwoman Hagar and their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchild Ishmael after he had brought them there from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCanaan. This is by no means improbable if one bears in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmind that for a camel-riding bedouin (and Abraham was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcertainly one) a journey of twenty or even thirty days\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas never been anything out of the ordinary. At first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tglance, the Biblical statement (Genesis xii, 14) that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas \"in the wilderness of Beersheba\" (i.e., in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsouthernmost tip of Palestine) that Abraham left Hagar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Ishmael would seem to conflict with the Qur'anic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccount. This seeming contradiction, however, disappears\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas soon as we remember that to the ancient, town-dwelling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHebrews the term \"wilderness of Beersheba\" comprised all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe desert regions south of Palestine, including the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHijaz. It was at the place where they had been abandoned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Hagar and Ishmael, after having discovered the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspring which is now called the Well of Zamzam, eventually\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettled; and it may have been that very spring which in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime induced a wandering group of bedouin families\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelonging to the South-Arabian (Qahtani) tribe of Jurhum\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto settle there. Ishmael later married a girl of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribe, and so became the progenitor of the musta'ribah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(\"Arabianized\") tribes - thus called on account of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescent from a Hebrew father and a Qahtani mother. As for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbraham, he is said to have often visited Hagar and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIshmael; and it was on the occasion of one of these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiodic visits that he, aided by Ishmael, erected the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toriginal structure of the Ka'bah. (For more detailed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccounts of the Abrahamic tradition, see Bukhari's Sahih,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKitab al-'Ilm, Tabari's Ta'rikh al-Umam, Ibn Sa'd, Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHisham, Mas'udi's Muruj adh-Dhahab, Yaqut's Mu'jam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Buldan, and other early Muslim historians.)"

This was not prompted by any specific revelation,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut was obviously due to the fact that the Ka'bah -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talthough it had in the meantime been filled with various\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tidols to which the pre-Islamic Arabs paid homage - was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talways regarded as the first temple ever dedicated to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOne God (cf.  3:96 ). Since he was aware of the sanctity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Jerusalem - the other holy centre of the unitarian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaith - the Prophet prayed, as a rule, before the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsouthern wall of the Ka'bah, towards the north, so as to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tface both the Ka'bah and Jerusalem. After the exodus to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMedina he continued to pray northwards, with only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJerusalem as his qiblah (direction of prayer). About\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsixteen months after his arrival at Medina, however, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceived a revelation (verses {142-150} of this surah)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich definitively established the Ka'bah as the qiblah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the followers of the Qur'an.

By including this kind of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpenditure within the essential acts of piety, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an implies that the freeing of people from bondage -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand, thus, the abolition of slavery - is one of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsocial objectives of Islam. At the time of the revelation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Qur'an, slavery was an established institution\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthroughout the world, and its sudden abolition would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen economically impossible. In order to obviate this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifficulty, and at the same time to bring about an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teventual abolition of all slavery, the Qur'an ordains in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 8:67  that henceforth only captives taken in a just war\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(jihad) may be kept as slaves.

Just as piety cannot become effective\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout righteous action, individual righteousness cannot\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome really effective in the social sense unless there\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis agreement within the community as to the social rights\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand obligations of its members: in other words, as to the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractical laws which should govern the behaviour of the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindividual within the society and the society's attitude\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttowards the individual and his actions. This is the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinnermost reason why legislation plays so great a role\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithin the ideology of Islam, and why the Qur'an\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsistently intertwines its moral and spiritual\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texhortation with ordinances relating to practical aspects\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof social life. Now one of the main problems facing any\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsociety is the safeguarding of the lives and the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindividual security of its members: and so it is\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstandable that laws relating to homicide and its\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunishment are dealt with prominently at this place. (It\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be borne in mind that \"The Cow\" was the first\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurah revealed in Medina, that is, at the time when the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim community had just become established as an\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindependent social entity.) As for the term qisas\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurring at the beginning of the above passage, it must\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe pointed out that - according to all the classical\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentators - it is almost synonymous with musawah,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ti.e., \"making a thing equal [to another thing]\": in this\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance, making the punishment equal (or appropriate) to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe crime - a meaning which is best rendered as \"just\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tretribution\" and not (as has been often, and erroneously,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdone) as \"retaliation\". Seeing that the Qur'an speaks\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\there of \"cases of killing\" (fi 'l-qatla, lit., \"in the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter of the killed\") in general, and taking into\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccount that this expression covers all possible cases of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thomicide - premeditated murder, murder under extreme\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovocation, culpable homicide, accidental manslaughter,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand so forth - it is obvious that the taking of a life\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor a life (implied in the term \"retaliation\") would not\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin every case correspond to the demands of equity. (This\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been made clear, for instance, in  4:92 , where legal\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trestitution for unintentional homicide is dealt with.)\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRead in conjunction with the term \"just retribution\"\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich introduces this passage, it is clear that the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstipulation \"the free for the free, the slave for the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave, the woman for the woman\" cannot - and has not been\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintended to - be taken in its literal, restrictive sense:\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor this would preclude its application to many cases of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thomicide, e.g., the killing of a free man by a slave, or\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof a woman by a man, or vice-versa. Thus, the above\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstipulation must be regarded as an example of the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telliptical mode of expression (ijaz) so frequently\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temployed in the Qur'an, and can have but one meaning,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnamely: \"if a free man has committed the crime, the free\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman must be punished; if a slave has committed the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcrime...\", etc. - in other words, whatever the status of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe guilty person, he or she (and he or she alone) is to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe punished in a manner appropriate to the crime."

As regards the expression harth (rendered by me as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"tilth\"), its primary significance is \"gain\" or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"acquisition\" through labour; and thus it often signifies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"worldly goods\" (see Lane II, 542), and especially the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcrops obtained by tilling land, as well as the tilled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tland itself. If harth is understood in this context as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"tilth\", it would apply, metaphorically, to human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tendeavours in general, and to social endeavours in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticular. However, some commentators - basing their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topinion on the Qur'anic sentence, \"your wives are your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttilth\" ( 2:223 )- maintain that harth stands here for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"wives\" (cf. Razi, and the philologist Al-Azhari, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquoted in Manar II, 248): in which case the \"destruction\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof tilth and progeny\" would be synonymous with an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupsetting of family life and, consequently, of the entire\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsocial fabric. According to either of these two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretations, the passage has the following meaning:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs soon as the mental attitude described above is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgenerally accepted and made the basis of social\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehaviour, it unavoidably results in widespread moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecay and, consequently, social disintegration."

What is alluded to in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse is no more than the relative homogeneity of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstinctive perceptions and inclinations characteristic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof man's primitive mentality and the primitive social\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torder in which he lived in those early days. Since that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thomogeneity was based on a lack of intellectual and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temotional differentiation rather than on a conscious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagreement among the members of human society, it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbound to disintegrate in the measure of man's subsequent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdevelopment. As his thought-life became more and more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplex, his emotional capacity and his individual needs,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoo, became more differentiated, conflicts of views and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterests came to the fore, and mankind ceased to be \"one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsingle community\" as regards their outlook on life and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir moral valuations: and it was at this stage that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivine guidance became necessary.

This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretation of the above Qur'anic passage is supported\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the fact that the famous Companion 'Abd Allah ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMas'ud used to read it thus: \"All mankind were once one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsingle community, and then they began to differ\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(fakhtalafu) - whereupon God raised up...\", etc. Although\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe word fakhtalafu interpolated here by Ibn Mas'ud does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot appear in the generally-accepted text of the Qur'an,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talmost all of the authorities are of the opinion that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis implied in the context."

There exist a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnumber of highly-authenticated Traditions to the effect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the wife of Thabit ibn Qays, Jamilah, came to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet and demanded a divorce from her husband on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tground that, in spite of his irreproachable character and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehaviour, she \"disliked him as she would dislike falling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto unbelief after having accepted Islam\".
