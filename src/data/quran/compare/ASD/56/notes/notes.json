The origin of both these metonyms is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbased on the belief of the pre-Islamic Arabs that future\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevents could be predicted by observing the direction of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe flight of birds at certain times: if they flew to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright, the event in question promised to be auspicious;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif to the left, the contrary. This ancient belief was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgradually absorbed by linguistic usage, so that \"right\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand \"left\" became more or less synonymous with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"auspicious\" and \"inauspicious\". In the idiom of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an, these two concepts have been deepened into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"righteousness\" and unrighteousness\", respectively."

In a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore general sense, hawar signifies simply \"whiteness\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Asas) or, as a moral qualification, \"purity\" (cf.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTabari, Razi and Ibn Kathir in their explanations of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterm hawariyyun in  3:52 ). Hence, the compound\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpression hur 'in signifies, approximately, \"pure beings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[or, more specifically, \"companions pure\"], most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeautiful of eye\" (which latter is the meaning of 'in,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe plural of a'yan). In his comments on the identical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpression in  52:20 , Razi observes that inasmuch as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson's eye reflects his soul more clearly than any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother part of the human body, 'in may be understood as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"rich of soul\" or \"soulful\". As regards the term hur in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits more current, feminine, connotation, quite a number\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the earliest Qur'an-commentators - among them Al-Hasan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Basri - understood it as signifying no more and no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tless than \"the righteous among the women of the human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkind\" (Tabari) - \"[even] those toothless old women of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyours whom God will resurrect as new beings\" (Al-Hasan,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas quoted by Razi in his comments on  44:54 ).

(In the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontext of this interpretation, Zamakhshari quotes also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 36:56 , which thus refers to the inmates of paradise:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"...in happiness will they and their spouses on couches\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecline\".
