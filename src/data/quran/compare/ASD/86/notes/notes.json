    "Body": "Some commentators assume that what is described here as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat-tariq (\"that which comes in the night\") is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmorning-star, because it appears towards the end of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnight; others - like Zamakhshari or Raghib - understand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby it \"the star\" in its generic sense. Now if we analyze\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe origin of this noun, we find that it is derived from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe verb taraqa, which primarily means \"he beat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[something]\" or \"knocked [at something]\"; hence, taraqa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'l-bab, \"he knocked at the door\". Tropically, the noun\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsignifies \"anything [or \"anyone\"] that comes in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnight\", because a person who comes to a house by night is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpected to knock at the door (Taj al-'Arus). In the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'anic mode of expression, at-tariq is evidently a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmetaphor for the heavenly solace which sometimes comes to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta human being lost in the deepest darkness of affliction\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand distress; or for the sudden, intuitive enlightenment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich disperses the darkness of uncertainty; or, finally,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor divine revelation, which knocks, as it were, at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoors of man's heart, and thus fulfils the functions of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboth solace and enlightenment. (For my rendering of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadjurative wa as \"Consider\", see surah {74}, first half\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof note [23].)"
