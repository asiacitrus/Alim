    "Body": "For the above rendering of atrab, see surah {56}, note\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[15]. As regards my rendering of kawa'ib as \"splendid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanions\", it is to be remembered that the term ka'b -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom which the participle ka'ib is derived - has many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeanings, and that one of these meanings is \"prominence\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"eminence\" or \"glory\" (Lisan al-'Arab); thus, the verb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tka'ba, when applied to a person, signifies \"he made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[another person] prominent\", \"glorious\" or \"splendid\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(ibid.) Based on this tropical meaning of both the verb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tka'ba and the noun ka'b, the participle ka'ib has often\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen used, in popular parlance, to denote \"a girl whose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreasts are becoming prominent\" or \"are budding\": hence,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmany commentators see in it an allusion to some sort of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyouthful \"female companions\" who would entertain the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(presumably male) inmates of paradise. But quite apart\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the fact that all Qur'anic allegories of the joys of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparadise invariably apply to men and women alike, this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretation of kawa'ib overlooks the purely derivative\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torigin of the above popular usage - which is based on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttropical connotation of \"prominence\" inherent in the noun\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tka'b - and substitutes for this obvious tropism the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tliteral meaning of something that is physically\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprominent: and this, in my opinion, is utterly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunjustified. If we bear in mind that the Qur'anic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescriptions of the blessings of paradise are always\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallegorical, we realize that in the above context the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterm kawa'ib can have no other meaning than \"glorious [or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"splendid\"] beings\", without any definition of sex; and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat, in combination with the term atrab, it denotes,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"splendid companions well-matched\" - thus alluding to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelations of the blest with one another, and stressing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe absolute mutual compatibility and equal dignity of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall of them.
