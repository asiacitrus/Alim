    "Body": "The above is perhaps the oldest Qur'anic mention of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterm and concept of al-jinnah (synonymous with al-jinn),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich has been tentatively explained in Appendix III. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe above context, the term probably denotes the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintangible, mysterious forces of nature to which man's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpsyche is exposed, and which sometimes make it difficult\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor us to discern between right and wrong. However, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe light of this last verse of the last surah of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an it is also possible to conclude that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"invisible forces\" from which we are told to seek refuge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith God are the temptations to evil emanating from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblindness of our own hearts, from our gross appetites,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand from the erroneous notions and false values that may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been handed down to us by our predecessors."
