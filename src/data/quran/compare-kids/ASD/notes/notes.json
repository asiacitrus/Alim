From the very earliest times,Islamic scholars have endeavoured to define the exactshades of meaning which differentiate the two terms. Thebest and simplest of these explanations is undoubtedlythe one advanced by Ibn al-Qayyim (as quoted in ManarI,48): the term rahman circumscribes the quality ofabounding grace inherent in, and inseparable from, theconcept of God's Being, whereas rahim expresses themanifestation of that grace in, and its effect upon, Hiscreation - in other words, an aspect of His activity."

The Arabic expression rabb - rendered byme as \"Sustainer\" - embraces a wide complex of meaningsnot easily expressed by a single term in anotherlanguage. It comprises the ideas of having a just claimto the possession of anything and, consequently,authority over it, as well as of rearing, sustaining andfostering anything from its inception to its finalcompletion. Thus, the head of a family is called rabbad-dar (\"master of the house\") because he has authorityover it and is responsible for its maintenance;similarly, his wife is called rabbat ad-dar (\"mistress ofthe house\"). Preceded by the definite article al, thedesignation rabb is applied, in the Qur'an, exclusivelyto God as the sole fosterer and sustainer of all creation- objective as well as conceptual - and therefore theultimate source of all authority."

Some commentators (e.g., Zamakhshari)interpret this passage as follows: \"...the way of thoseupon whom Thou hast bestowed Thy blessings - those whohave not been condemned [by Thee], and who do not goastray\": in other words, they regard the last twoexpressions as defining \"those upon whom Thou hastbestowed Thy blessings\". Other commentators (e.g.,Baghawi and Ibn Kathir) do not subscribe to thisinterpretation - which would imply the use of negativedefinitions - and understand the last verse of the surahin the manner rendered by me above. As regards the twocategories of people following a wrong course, some ofthe greatest Islamic thinkers (e.g., Al-Ghazali or, inrecent times, Muhammad 'Abduh) held the view that thepeople described as having incurred \"God's condemnation\"- that is, having deprived themselves of His grace - arethose who have become fully cognizant of God's messageand, having understood it, have rejected it; while by\"those who go astray\" are meant people whom the truth haseither not reached at all, or to whom it has come in sogarbled and corrupted a form as to make it difficult forthem to recognize it as the truth (see 'Abduh in Manar I,68 ff.)."

Thisinterpretation of the \"bond with God\" seems to beindicated by the fact that there is no mention of anyspecific \"covenant\" in either the preceding or thesubsequent verses of the passage under consideration. Thedeliberate omission of any explanatory reference in thisconnection suggests that the expression \"bond with God\"stands for something that is rooted in the humansituation as such, and can, therefore, be perceivedinstinctively as well as through conscious experience:namely, that innate relationship with God which makes Him\"closer to man than his neck-vein\" ( 50:16 ).

It wouldappear that the moral of this story points to animportant problem of all (and, therefore, also ofIslamic) religious jurisprudence: namely, theinadvisability of trying to elicit additional details inrespect of any religious law that had originally beengiven in general terms - for, the more numerous andmultiform such details become, the more complicated andrigid becomes the law. This point has been acutelygrasped by Rashid Rida', who says in his commentary onthe above Qur'anic passage (see Manar I, 345 f.): \"Itslesson is that one should not pursue one's [legal]inquiries in such a way as to make laws morecomplicated.... This was how the early generations [ofMuslims] visualized the problem. They did not make thingscomplicated for themselves - and so, for them, thereligious law (din) was natural, simple and liberal inits straightforwardness. But those who came later addedto it [certain other] injunctions which they had deducedby means of their own reasoning (ijtihad); and theymultiplied those [additional] injunctions to such anextent that the religious law became a heavy burden onthe community.\" For the sociological reason why thegenuine ordinances of Islamic Law - that is, those whichhave been prima facie laid down as such in the Qur'an andthe teachings of the Prophet - are almost always devoidof details, I would refer the reader to my book State andGovernment in Islam (pp. 11 ff. and passim). Theimportance of this problem, illustrated in the abovestory of the cow - and correctly grasped by the Prophet'sCompanions - explains why this surah has been entitled\"The Cow\".

Neither the Qur'an, nor anysaying of the Prophet, nor even the Bible offers theslightest warrant for this highly imaginativeexplanation, which must, therefore, be rejected - quiteapart from the fact that the pronoun hu in idribuhu has amasculine gender, while the noun nafs (here translated as\"human being\") is feminine in gender: from which itfollows that the imperative idribuhu cannot possiblyrefer to nafs. On the other hand, the verb daraba (lit.,\"he struck\") is very often used in a figurative ormetonymic sense, as, for instance, in the expressiondaraba fi 'l-ard (\"he journeyed on earth\"), or daraba'sh-shay' bi'sh-shay' (\"he mixed one thing with anotherthing\"), or daraba mathal (\"he coined a similitude\" or\"propounded a parable\" or \"gave an illustration\"), or'ala darb wahid (\"similarly applied\" or \"in the samemanner\"), or duribat 'alayhim adh-dhillah (\"humiliationwas imposed on them\" or \"applied to them\"), and so forth.Taking all this into account, I am of the opinion thatthe imperative idribuhu occurring in the above Qur'anicpassage must be translated as \"apply it\" or \"this\"(referring, in this context, to the principle of communalresponsibility). As for the feminine pronoun ha inba'diha (\"some of it\"), it must necessarily relate to thenearest preceding feminine noun - that is, to the nafsthat has been murdered, or the act of murder itself aboutwhich (fiha) the community disagreed. Thus, the phraseidribuhu bi-ba'diha may be suitably rendered as \"applythis [principle] to some of those [cases of unresolvedmurder]\": for it is obvious that the principle ofcommunal responsibility for murder by a person or personsunknown can be applied only to some and not to all suchcases."

The word ayah (\"message\")occurring in this context is also used to denote a\"verse\" of the Qur'an (because every one of these versescontains a message). Taking this restricted meaning ofthe term ayah, some scholars conclude from the abovepassage that certain verses of the Qur'an have been\"abrogated\" by God's command before the revelation of theQur'an was completed. Apart from the fancifulness of thisassertion - which calls to mind the image of a humanauthor correcting, on second thought, the proofs of hismanuscript, deleting one passage and replacing it withanother - there does not exist a single reliableTradition to the effect that the Prophet ever declared averse of the Qur'an to have been \"abrogated\". At the rootof the so-called \"doctrine of abrogation\" may lie theinability of some of the early commentators to reconcileone Qur'anic passage with another: a difficulty which wasovercome by declaring that one of the verses in questionhad been \"abrogated\". This arbitrary procedure explainsalso why there is no unanimity whatsoever among theupholders of the \"doctrine of abrogation\" as to which,and how many, Qur'an-verses have been affected by it;and, furthermore, as to whether this alleged abrogationimplies a total elimination of the verse in question fromthe context of the Qur'an, or only a cancellation of thespecific ordinance or statement contained in it. Inshort, the \"doctrine of abrogation\" has no basis whateverin historical fact, and must be rejected. On the otherhand, the apparent difficulty in interpreting the aboveQur'anic passage disappears immediately if the term ayahis understood, correctly, as \"message\", and if we readthis verse in conjunction with the preceding one, whichstates that the Jews and the Christians refuse to acceptany revelation which might supersede that of the Bible:for, if read in this way, the abrogation relates to theearlier divine messages and not to any part of the Qur'anitself."

In other placesthe Qur'an speaks of it as \"the Ancient Temple\" (al-baytal-'atiq), and frequently also as \"the Inviolable Houseof Worship\" (al-masjid al-haram). Its prototype is saidto have been built by Abraham as the first temple everdedicated to the One God (see  3:96 ), and which for thisreason has been instituted as the direction of prayer(qiblah) for all Muslims, and as the goal of the annuallyrecurring pilgrimage (hajj). It is to be noted that evenin pre-Islamic times the Ka'bah was associated with thememory of Abraham, whose personality had always been inthe foreground of Arabian thought. According to veryancient Arabian traditions, it was at the site of whatlater became Mecca that Abraham, in order to placateSarah, abandoned his Egyptian bondwoman Hagar and theirchild Ishmael after he had brought them there fromCanaan. This is by no means improbable if one bears inmind that for a camel-riding bedouin (and Abraham wascertainly one) a journey of twenty or even thirty dayshas never been anything out of the ordinary. At firstglance, the Biblical statement (Genesis xii, 14) that itwas \"in the wilderness of Beersheba\" (i.e., in thesouthernmost tip of Palestine) that Abraham left Hagarand Ishmael would seem to conflict with the Qur'anicaccount. This seeming contradiction, however, disappearsas soon as we remember that to the ancient, town-dwellingHebrews the term \"wilderness of Beersheba\" comprised allthe desert regions south of Palestine, including theHijaz. It was at the place where they had been abandonedthat Hagar and Ishmael, after having discovered thespring which is now called the Well of Zamzam, eventuallysettled; and it may have been that very spring which intime induced a wandering group of bedouin familiesbelonging to the South-Arabian (Qahtani) tribe of Jurhumto settle there. Ishmael later married a girl of thistribe, and so became the progenitor of the musta'ribah(\"Arabianized\") tribes - thus called on account of theirdescent from a Hebrew father and a Qahtani mother. As forAbraham, he is said to have often visited Hagar andIshmael; and it was on the occasion of one of theseperiodic visits that he, aided by Ishmael, erected theoriginal structure of the Ka'bah.

Since he was aware of the sanctityof Jerusalem - the other holy centre of the unitarianfaith - the Prophet prayed, as a rule, before thesouthern wall of the Ka'bah, towards the north, so as toface both the Ka'bah and Jerusalem. After the exodus toMedina he continued to pray northwards, with onlyJerusalem as his qiblah (direction of prayer). Aboutsixteen months after his arrival at Medina, however, hereceived a revelation (verses {142-150} of this surah)which definitively established the Ka'bah as the qiblahof the followers of the Qur'an. This \"abandonment\" ofJerusalem obviously displeased the Jews of Medina, whomust have felt gratified when they saw the Muslimspraying towards their holy city; and it is to them thatthe opening sentence of this passage refers. If oneconsiders the matter from the historical point of view,there had never been any change in the divinecommandments relating to the qiblah: there had simplybeen no ordinance whatever in this respect before verses{142-150} were revealed. Their logical connection withthe preceding passages, which deal, in the main, withAbraham and his creed, lies in the fact that it wasAbraham who erected the earliest structure of the templewhich later came to be known as the Ka'bah."

On furtheranalysis, the expression \"a community of the middle way\"might be said to summarize, as it were, the Islamicattitude towards the problem of man's existence as such:a denial of the view that there is an inherent conflictbetween the spirit and the flesh, and a bold affirmationof the natural, God-willed unity in this twofold aspectof human life. This balanced attitude, peculiar to Islam,flows directly from the concept of God's oneness and,hence, of the unity of purpose underlying all Hiscreation: and thus, the mention of the \"community of themiddle way\" at this place is a fitting introduction tothe theme of the Ka'bah, a symbol of God's oneness."

In order to obviate thisdifficulty, and at the same time to bring about aneventual abolition of all slavery, the Qur'an ordains in 8:67  that henceforth only captives taken in a just war(jihad) may be kept as slaves. But even with regard topersons enslaved in this or - before the revelation of 8:67  - in any other way, the Qur'an stresses the greatmerit inherent in the freeing of slaves, and stipulatesit as a means of atonement for various transgressions(see, e.g.,  4:92 ,  5:89 ,  58:3 ). In addition, theProphet emphatically stated on many occasions that, inthe sight of God, the unconditional freeing of a humanbeing from bondage is among the most praiseworthy actswhich a Muslim could perform. (For a critical discussionand analysis of all the authentic Traditions bearing onthis problem, see Nayl al-Awtar VI, 199 ff.)"

                "text": "After having pointed out that true piety does not consistin mere adherence to outward forms and rites, the Qur'anopens, as it were, a new chapter relating to the problemof man's behaviour. Just as piety cannot become effectivewithout righteous action, individual righteousness cannotbecome really effective in the social sense unless thereis agreement within the community as to the social rightsand obligations of its members: in other words, as to thepractical laws which should govern the behaviour of theindividual within the society and the society's attitudetowards the individual and his actions. This is theinnermost reason why legislation plays so great a rolewithin the ideology of Islam, and why the Qur'anconsistently intertwines its moral and spiritualexhortation with ordinances relating to practical aspectsof social life. Now one of the main problems facing anysociety is the safeguarding of the lives and theindividual security of its members: and so it isunderstandable that laws relating to homicide and itspunishment are dealt with prominently at this place. (Itshould be borne in mind that \"The Cow\" was the firstsurah revealed in Medina, that is, at the time when theMuslim community had just become established as anindependent social entity.) As for the term qisasoccurring at the beginning of the above passage, it mustbe pointed out that - according to all the classicalcommentators - it is almost synonymous with musawah,i.e., \"making a thing equal [to another thing]\": in thisinstance, making the punishment equal (or appropriate) tothe crime - a meaning which is best rendered as \"justretribution\" and not (as has been often, and erroneously,done) as \"retaliation\". Seeing that the Qur'an speakshere of \"cases of killing\" (fi 'l-qatla, lit., \"in thematter of the killed\") in general, and taking intoaccount that this expression covers all possible cases ofhomicide - premeditated murder, murder under extremeprovocation, culpable homicide, accidental manslaughter,and so forth - it is obvious that the taking of a lifefor a life (implied in the term \"retaliation\") would notin every case correspond to the demands of equity. (Thishas been made clear, for instance, in  4:92 , where legalrestitution for unintentional homicide is dealt with.)Read in conjunction with the term \"just retribution\"which introduces this passage, it is clear that thestipulation \"the free for the free, the slave for theslave, the woman for the woman\" cannot - and has not beenintended to - be taken in its literal, restrictive sense:for this would preclude its application to many cases ofhomicide, e.g., the killing of a free man by a slave, orof a woman by a man, or vice-versa. Thus, the abovestipulation must be regarded as an example of theelliptical mode of expression (ijaz) so frequentlyemployed in the Qur'an, and can have but one meaning,namely: \"if a free man has committed the crime, the freeman must be punished; if a slave has commited thecrime...\", etc. - in other words, whatever the status ofthe guilty person, he or she (and he or she alone) is tobe punished in a manner appropriate to the crime."

There is no linguistic justification whateverfor attributing - as some of the commentators have done -the pronoun \"his\" to the victim and, thus, for assumingthat the expression \"brother\" stands for the victim's\"family\" or \"blood relations\". The pronoun \"his\" refers,unquestionably, to the guilty person; and since there isno reason for assuming that by \"his brother\" a realbrother is meant, we cannot escape the conclusion that itdenotes here \"his brother in faith\" of \"his fellow-man\" -in either of which terms the whole community is included.Thus, the expression \"if something is remitted to aguilty person by his brother\" (i.e., by the community orits legal organs) may refer either to the establishmentof mitigating circumstances in a case of murder, or tothe finding that the case under trial falls within thecategories of culpable homicide or manslaughter - inwhich cases no capital punishment is to be exacted andrestitution is to be made by the payment of an indemnitycalled diyyah (see  4:92 ) to the relatives of thevictim. In consonance with the oft-recurring Qur'anicexhortation to forgiveness and forbearance, the\"remission\" mentioned above may also (and especially incases of accidental manslaughter) relate to a partial oreven total waiving of any claim to indemnification."

Most of the commentators see in this sentencean indication of a conscious intent on the part of theperson thus described; but it is also possible that theparticle li in li-yufsida (generally taken to mean \"inorder that he might spread corruption\") plays in thiscontext the role of what the grammarians call a lamal-'aqibah, \"the [letter] lam used to denote aconsequence\" - i.e., regardless of the existence ornon-existence of a conscious intent. (By rendering thesentence the way I do it, both possibilities are leftopen.) As regards the expression harth (rendered by me as\"tilth\"), its primary significance is \"gain\" or\"acquisition\" through labour; and thus it often signifies\"worldly goods\" (see Lane II, 542), and especially thecrops obtained by tilling land, as well as the tilledland itself. If harth is understood in this context as\"tilth\", it would apply, metaphorically, to humanendeavours in general, and to social endeavours inparticular. However, some commentators - basing theiropinion on the Qur'anic sentence, \"your wives are yourtilth\" ( 2:223 )- maintain that harth stands here for\"wives\" (cf. Razi, and the philologist Al-Azhari, asquoted in Manar II, 248): in which case the \"destructionof tilth and progeny\" would be synonymous with anupsetting of family life and, consequently, of the entiresocial fabric. According to either of these twointerpretations, the passage has the following meaning:As soon as the mental attitude described above isgenerally accepted and made the basis of socialbehaviour, it unavoidably results in widespread moraldecay and, consequently, social disintegration."

As his thought-life became more and morecomplex, his emotional capacity and his individual needs,too, became more differentiated, conflicts of views andinterests came to the fore, and mankind ceased to be \"onesingle community\" as regards their outlook on life andtheir moral valuations: and it was at this stage thatdivine guidance became necessary.

Thereupon theProphet ordained that she should return to Thabit thegarden which he has given her as her dower (mahr) at thetime of their wedding, and decreed that the marriageshould be dissolved. (Several variants of this Traditionhave been recorded by Bukhari, Nasa'i, Tirmidhi, IbnMajah and Bayhaqi, on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas.)Similar Traditions, handed down on the authority of'A'ishah and relating to a woman called Hubaybah bintSahl, are to be found in the Muwatta' of Imam Malik, inthe Musnad of Imam Ahmad, and in the compilations ofNasa'i and Abu Da'ud (in one variant, the latter givesthe woman's name as Hafsah bint Sahl). In accordance withthese Traditions, Islamic Law stipulates that whenever amarriage is dissolved at the wife's instance without anyoffence on the part of the husband against his maritalobligations, the wife is the contract-breaking party andmust, therefore, return the dower which she received fromhim at the time of concluding the marriage: and in thisevent \"there shall be no sin upon either of them\" if thehusband takes back the dower which the wife gives up ofher own free will. An exhaustive discussion of all theseTraditions and their legal implications is found in Naylal-Awtar VII, pp. 34-41.

This interpretation is not,however, entirely convincing. Although there is not theleast doubt that in this context the pronominal ma refersto earlier revelations, and particularly the Bible (as isevident from the parallel use of the above expression inother Qur'anic passages), the idiomatic phrase ma baynayadayhi does not, in itself, mean \"that which came beforeit\" - i.e., in time - but, rather (as pointed out by mein surah {2}, note [247]), \"that which lies open beforeit\". Since, however, the pronoun \"it\" relates here to theQur'an, the metaphorical expression \"between its hands\"or \"before it\" cannot possibly refer to \"knowledge\" (asit does in  2:255 ), but must obviously refer to anobjective reality with which the Qur'an is \"confronted\":that is, something that was coexistent in time with therevelation of the Qur'an. Now this, taken together (a)with the fact - frequently stressed in the Qur'an andsince established by objective scholarship - that in thecourse of the millennia the Bible has been subjected toconsiderable and often arbitrary alteration, and (b) withthe fact that many of the laws enunciated in the Qur'andiffer from the laws of the Bible, brings us forcibly tothe conclusion that the \"confirmation\" of the latter bythe Qur'an can refer only to the basic truths stilldiscernible in the Bible, and not to its time-boundlegislation or to its present text - in other words, aconfirmation of whatever was extant of its basicteachings at the time of the revelation of the Qur'an:and it is this that the phrase ma bayna yadayhi expressesin this context as well as in  5:46  and {48} or in 61:6  (where it refers to Jesus' confirming the truth of\"whatever there still remained [i.e., in his lifetime] ofthe Torah\")."

Lisan al-'Arab,art. nass). Consequently, Tabari regards as ayat muhkamatonly those statements or ordinances of the Qur'an whichdo not admit of more than one interpretation (which doesnot, of course, preclude differences of opinion regardingthe implications of a particular ayah muhkamah). In myopinion, however, it would be too dogmatic to regard anypassage of the Qur'an which does not conform to the abovedefinition as mutashabih (\"allegorical\"): for there aremany statements in the Qur'an which are liable to morethan one interpretation but are, nevertheless, notallegorical - just as there are many expressions andpassages which, despite their allegorical formulation,reveal to the searching intellect only one possiblemeaning. For this reason, the ayat mutashabihat may bedefined as those passages of the Qur'an which areexpressed in a figurative manner, with a meaning that ismetaphorically implied but not directly, in so manywords, stated. The ayat muhkamat are described as the\"essence of the divine writ\" (umm al-kitab) because theycomprise the fundamental principles underlying itsmessage and, in particular, its ethical and socialteachings: and it is only on the basis of these clearlyenunciated principles that the allegorical passages canbe correctly interpreted.

This view of the classicalcommentators, however, does not seem to take into accountthe many Qur'anic passages which do not deal withmetaphysical subjects and yet are, undoubtedly,allegorical in intent and expression. To my mind, onecannot arrive at a correct understanding of the abovepassage without paying due attention to the nature andfunction of allegory as such. A true allegory - incontrast with a mere pictorial paraphrase of somethingthat could equally well be stated in direct terms - isalways meant to express in a figurative manner somethingwhich, because of its complexity, cannot be adequatelyexpressed in direct terms or propositions and, because ofthis very complexity, can be grasped only intuitively, asa general mental image, and not as a series of detailed\"statements\": and this seems to be the meaning of thephrase, \"none save God knows its final meaning\"."

According to some commentators, however (e.g.,Manar III, 234), the above Qur'anic passage has a generalimport and alludes to an occurrence often witnessed inhistory - namely, the victory of a numerically weak andill-equipped group of people, filled with a burningbelief in the righteousness of their cause, over amaterially and numerically superior enemy lacking asimilar conviction. The fact that in this Qur'an-versethe believers are spoken of as being faced by an enemy\"twice their number\" (while at the battle of Badr thepagan Quraysh were more than three times the number ofthe Muslims) lends great plausibility to this explanation- and particularly so in view of the allusion, in thenext verse, to material riches and worldly power."

But while the word sahar (also spelled sahr andsuhr), of which ashar is the plural, undoubtedly denotes\"the time before daybreak\", it also signifies - in thespellings sahar and suhr - \"the core of the heart\", \"theinner part of the heart\", or simply \"heart\" (cf.

This anointment appears to havebeen so important a rite among the Hebrews that the term\"the anointed\" became in the course of time more or lesssynonymous with \"king\". Its application to Jesus may havebeen due to the widespread conviction among hiscontemporaries (references to which are found in severalplaces in the Synoptic Gospels) that he was descended indirect - and obviously legitimate - line from the royalHouse of David. (It is to be noted that this could nothave related to his mother's side, because Mary belongedto the priestly class descending from Aaron, and thus tothe tribe of Levi, while David descended from the tribeof Judah.) Whatever may have been the historicalcircumstances, it is evident that the honorific \"theAnointed\" was applied to Jesus in his own lifetime. Inthe Greek version of the Gospels - which is undoubtedlybased on a now-lost Aramaic original - this designationis correctly translated as Christos (a noun derived fromthe Greek verb chriein, \"to anoint\"): and since it is inthis form - \"the Christ\" - that the designation al-masihhas achieved currency in all Western languages, I amusing it throughout in my translation."

Many instances of this idiomatic use of tayrand ta'ir are given in all the authoritative Arabicdictionaries; see also Lane V, 1904 f. Thus, in theparabolic manner so beloved by him, Jesus intimated tothe children of Israel that out of the humble clay oftheir lives he would fashion for them the vision of asoaring destiny, and that this vision, brought to life byhis God-given inspiration, would become their realdestiny by God's leave and by the strength of their faith(as pointed out at the end of this verse)."

Tabari, Razi, Ibn Kathir). It is,however, most probable - and the evidence provided by therecently discovered Dead Sea Scrolls strongly supportsthis view - that the term hawari was popularly used todenote a member of the Essene Brotherhood, a Jewishreligious group which existed in Palestine at the time ofJesus, and to which, possibly, he himself belonged. TheEssenes were distinguished by their strong insistence onmoral purity and unselfish conduct, and always wore whitegarments as the outward mark of their convictions; andthis would satisfactorily explain the name given to them.The fact that the Prophet once said, \"Every prophet hashis hawari\" (Bukhari and Muslim) does not conflict withthe above view, since he obviously used this termfiguratively, recalling thereby Jesus' \"helpers in God'scause\"."

In order to answer the objectionrelating to Jewish food laws, the Qur'an calls to mindthat originally all wholesome foods were lawful to thechildren of Israel, and that the severe restrictionssubsequently imposed upon them in the Torah were but apunishment for their sins (cf.  6:146 ), and were,therefore, never intended for a community that trulysurrenders itself to God.

The mention, in this context, of theTemple in Mecca - that is, the Ka'bah - arises from thefact that it is the direction of prayer (qiblah)stipulated in the Qur'an. Since the prototype of theKa'bah was built by Abraham and Ishmael (see  2:125  ff.)- and is, therefore, much older than the Temple ofSolomon in Jerusalem - its establishment as the qiblah ofthe followers of the Quran does not only not imply anybreak with the Abrahamic tradition (on which, ultimately,the whole Bible rests), but, on the contrary,re-establishes the direct contact with that Patriarch:and herein lies the answer to the second of the twoJewish objections mentioned in note [73] above."

My rendering ofnafs, in this context, as \"living entity\" follows thesame reasoning. - As regards the expression zawjaha (\"itsmate\"), it is to be noted that, with reference to animatebeings, the term zawj (\"a pair\", \"one of a pair\" or \"amate\") applies to the male as well as to the femalecomponent of a pair or couple; hence, with reference tohuman beings, it signifies a woman's mate (husband) aswell as a man's mate (wife). Abu Muslim - as quoted byRazi - interprets the phrase \"He created out of it(minha) its mate\" as meaning \"He created its mate [i.e.,its sexual counterpart] out of its own kind (minjinsiha)\", thus supporting the view of Muhammad 'Abduhreferred to above.

                "text": "Lit., \"whom your right hands possess\" - i.e., from amongthe captives taken in a war in God's cause (regardingwhich see surah {2}, notes [167] and [168], and surah{8}, note [72]). It is obvious that the phrase \"two, orthree, or four: but if you have reason to fear...\", etc.is a parenthetic clause relating to both the free womenmentioned in the first part of the sentence and to femaleslaves - for both these nouns are governed by theimperative verb \"marry\". Thus, the whole sentence hasthis meaning: \"Marry from among [other] women such as arelawful to you, or [from among] those whom you rightfullypossess - [even] two, or three, or four: but if you havereason to fear that you might not be able to treat themwith equal fairness, then [only] one\" - implying that,irrespective of whether they are free women or,originally, slaves, the number of wives must not exceedfour. It was in this sense that Muhammad 'Abduhunderstood the above verse (see Manar IV, 350). This viewis, moreover, supported by verse {25} of this surah aswell as by  24:32 , where marriage with female slaves isspoken of. Contrary to the popular view and the practiceof many Muslims in the past centuries, neither the Qur'annor the life-example of the Prophet provides any sanctionfor sexual intercourse without marriage. As regards thepermission to marry more than one wife (up to the maximumof four), it is so restricted by the condition, \"if youhave reason to fear that you might not be able to treatthem with equal fairness, then [marry only] one\", as tomake such plural marriages possible only in quiteexceptional cases and under exceptional circumstances(see also the first clause of  24:32  and thecorresponding note [42]). Still, one might ask why thesame latitude has not been given to women as well; butthe answer is simple. Notwithstanding the spiritualfactor of love which influences the relations between manand woman, the determinant biological reason for thesexual urge is, in both sexes, procreation: and whereas awoman can, at one time, conceive a child from one manonly and has to carry it for nine months before she canconceive another, a man can beget a child every time hecohabits with a woman. Thus, while nature would have beenmerely wasteful if it had produced a polygamous instinctin woman, man's polygamous inclination is biologicallyjustified. It is, of course, obvious that the biologicalfactor is only one - and by no means always the mostimportant - of the aspects of marital love: none theless, it is a basic factor and, therefore, decisive inthe institution of marriage as such. With the wisdom thatalways takes human nature fully into account, Islamic Lawundertakes no more than the safeguarding of thesocio-biological function of marriage (which includesalso care of the progeny), allowing a man to have morethan one wife and not allowing a woman to have more thanone husband at one time; while the spiritual problem ofmarriage, being imponderable and therefore outside thescope of law, is left to the discretion of the partners.In any event - since marriage in Islam is a purely civilcontract - recourse to divorce is always open to eitherof the two partners. (Regarding the dissolution of amarriage at the wife's instance, see surah {2}, note[218].)"

This unwarranted assumptionmust, however, be rejected. Quite apart from theimpossibility of admitting that any passage of the Qur'ancould have been \"abrogated\" by another of its passages(see surah {2}, note [87]), the expression fahishah doesnot, by itself, connote illicit sexual intercourse: itsignifies anything that is grossly immodest, unseemly,lewd, indecent or abominable in word or in deed (cf. LaneVI, 2344f.), and is by no means restricted to sexualtransgressions.

However, quite apart from the fundamentaldifferences of opinion, even among the Companions of theProphet, regarding the legality of such a marriage, someof the most outstanding commentators hold the view thatma malakat aymanukum denotes here \"women whom yourightfully possess through wedlock\"; thus Razi in hiscommentary on this verse, and Tabari in one of hisalternative explanations (going back to 'Abd Allah ibn'Abbas, Mujahid, and others). Razi, in particular, pointsout that the reference to \"all married women\"(al-muhsanat min an-nisa'), coming as it does after theenumeration of prohibited degrees of relationship, ismeant to stress the prohibition of sexual relations withany woman other than one's lawful wife."

This formulation,however, has baffled many a commentator: for, if takenliterally, it would imply that wrongful profits fromtrading based on mutual agreement are excepted from thegeneral prohibition, \"Devour not one another'spossessions wrongfully\" - a supposition impossible tomaintain in view of the ethics postulated by the Qur'an.To obviate this difficulty, most of the commentatorsexpress the opinion that the particle illa has in thiscontext the meaning of \"but\", and that the clause oughtto be understood as follows: \"but it is lawful for you toprofit from one another's possessions by way oflegitimate trade based on mutual agreement\". However,quite apart from the fact that this interpretation ishighly laboured and artificial, it does not explain why\"legitimate trade\" should have been singled out here as asole means of lawfully deriving economic benefits fromone another - for, as Razi rightly points out in hiscommentary on this verse, \"it is no less lawful tobenefit economically through a gift, a bequest, a legalinheritance, alms, a dower, or an indemnity for injuriesreceived: for there are, aside from trade, many ways ofacquiring possessions [lawfully]\". Why, then, shouldtrade alone have been stressed? - and, moreover, stressedin a context not particularly devoted to matters oftrade? A really satisfactory answer to this puzzle can,in my opinion, be obtained only through a linguisticconsideration of the particle illa. Apart from its usualconnotation of \"except\" or \"unless it be\", it hassometimes - as has been pointed out in both Qamus andMughni - the meaning of the simple conjunction \"and\"(wa); similarly, if it is preceded by a negative clause,it can be synonymous with \"nor\" or \"and neither\" (wa-la):as, for instance, in {27:10-11}, \"no fear need themessage-bearers have in My Presence, and neither (illa)need he who...\", etc. Now if we apply this particular useof illa to the passage under consideration, we arrive atthe reading, \"nor [shall you do it] by means of tradebased on mutual agreement\", or simply, \"not even by wayof trade based on mutual agreement\" - whereupon themeaning immediately becomes obvious: the believers areprohibited from devouring another person's possessionswrongfully even if that other person - being the weakerparty - agrees to such a deprivation or exploitationunder the stress of circumstances. The reading adopted byme logically connects, moreover, with verse {32}, whichadmonishes the believers not to covet one another'spossessions."

With all this, he stipulated in hissermon on the occasion of the Farewell Pilgrimage,shortly before his death, that beating should be resortedto only if the wife \"has become guilty, in an obviousmanner, of immoral conduct\", and that it should be done\"in such a way as not to cause pain (ghayr mubarrih)\";authentic Traditions to this effect are found in Muslim,Tirmidhi, Abu Da'ad, Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. On the basisof these Traditions, all the authorities stress that this\"beating\", if resorted to at all, should be more or lesssymbolic - \"with a toothbrush, or some such thing\"(Tabari, quoting the views of scholars of the earliesttimes), or even \"with a folded handkerchief\" (Razi); andsome of the greatest Muslim scholars (e.g., Ash-Shafi'i)are of the opinion that it is just barely permissible,and should preferably be avoided: and they justify thisopinion by the Prophet's personal feelings with regard tothis problem."

As regards the prohibition of attempting to pray\"while in a state of drunkenness\", some of thecommentators assume that this ordinance represented thefirst stage of the total prohibition of intoxicants, andhas been, consequently, \"abrogated\" by the promulgationof the law of total abstinence from all intoxicants( 5:90 ). However, quite apart from the fact that thedoctrine of \"abrogation\" is entirely untenable (see surah{2}, note [87]), there is no warrant whatever forregarding the above verse as a \"first step\" which hasbecome redundant, as it were, after total prohibition wasordained. It is, of course, true that the Qur'an forbidsthe use of intoxicants at all times, and not merely atthe time of prayer; but since \"man has been created weak\"( 4:28 ), his lapse from the way of virtue is always apossibility: and it is to prevent him from adding the sinof praying while in a state of drunkenness to the sin ofusing intoxicants as such that the above verse waspromulgated. Moreover, the expression \"while you are in astate of drunkenness (sukara)\" does not apply exclusivelyto alcoholic intoxication, since the term sukr, in itswider connotation, signifies any state of mentaldisequilibrium which prevents man from making full use ofhis intellectual faculties: that is to say, it can applyalso to a temporary clouding of the intellect by drugs orgiddiness or passion, as well as to the statemetaphorically described as \"drunk with sleep\" - inbrief, to any condition in which normal judgment isconfused or suspended.

However, not everything that man regards as\"evil fortune\" is really, in its final effect, evil -for, \"it may well be that you hate a thing the while itis good for you, and it may well be that you love a thingthe while it is bad for you: and God knows, whereas youdo not know\" ( 2:216 ). Thus, many an apparent \"evil\" maysometimes be no more than a trial and a God-willed meansof spiritual growth through suffering, and need notnecessarily be the result of a wrong choice or a wrongdeed on the part of the person thus afflicted. It is,therefore, obvious that the \"evil\" or \"evil fortune\" ofwhich this verse speaks has a restricted connotation,inasmuch as it refers to evil in the moral sense of theword: that is to say, to suffering resulting from theactions or the behaviour of the person concerned, andthis in accordance with the natural law of cause andeffect which God has decreed for all His creation, andwhich the Qur'an describes as \"the way of God\" (sunnatAllah).

It is this wider, moraland ethical meaning of the term hijrah to which the abovepassage refers - just as the preceding passage (verses{95-96}) referred to \"striving hard in God's cause\"(jihad) in the widest sense of the term, embracing bothphysical and moral efforts and the sacrifice, if need be,of one's possessions and even one's life. While thephysical exodus from Mecca to Medina ceased to beobligatory for the believers after the conquest of Meccain the year 8 H., the spiritual exodus from the domain ofevil to that of righteousness continues to be afundamental demand of Islam: in other words, a person whodoes not \"migrate from evil unto God\" cannot beconsidered a believer - which explains the condemnation,in the next sentence, of all who are remiss in thisrespect."

There exist, among Muslims, manyfanciful legends telling us that at the last moment Godsubstituted for Jesus a person closely resembling him(according to some accounts, that person was Judas), whowas subsequently crucified in his place. However, none ofthese legends finds the slightest support in the Qur'anor in authentic Traditions, and the stories produced inthis connection by the classical commentators must besummarily rejected. They represent no more than confusedattempts at \"harmonizing\" the Qur'anic statement thatJesus was not crucified with the graphic description, inthe Gospels, of his crucifixion. The story of thecrucifixion as such has been succinctly explained in theQur'anic phrase wa-lakin shubbiha lahum, which I renderas \"but it only appeared to them as if it had been so\" -implying that in the course of time, long after the timeof Jesus, a legend had somehow grown up (possibly underthe then-powerful influence of Mithraistic beliefs) tothe effect that he had died on the cross in order toatone for the \"original sin\" with which mankind isallegedly burdened; and this legend became so firmlyestablished among the latter-day followers of Jesus thateven his enemies, the Jews, began to believe it - albeitin a derogatory sense (for crucifixion was, in thosetimes, a heinous form of death-penalty reserved for thelowest of criminals). This, to my mind, is the onlysatisfactory explanation of the phrase wa-lakin shubbihalahum, the more so as the expression shubbiha li isidiomatically synonymous with khuyyila li, \"[a thing]became a fancied image to me\", i.e., \"in my mind\" - inother words, \"[it] seemed to me\" (see Qamus, art.khayala, as well as Lane II, 833, and IV, 1500)."

Nowhere in the Qur'an is thereany warrant for the popular belief that God has \"takenup\" Jesus bodily, in his lifetime, into heaven. Theexpression \"God exalted him unto Himself\" in the aboveverse denotes the elevation of Jesus to the realm ofGod's special grace - a blessing in which all prophetspartake, as is evident from  19:57 , where the verbrafa'nahu (\"We exalted him\") is used with regard to theProphet Idris.

The termminhaj, on the other hand, denotes an \"open road\",usually in an abstract sense: that is, \"a way of life\".The terms shir'ah and minhaj are more restricted in theirmeaning than the term din, which comprises not merely thelaws relating to a particular religion but also thebasic, unchanging spiritual truths which, according tothe Qur'an, have been preached by every one of God'sapostles, while the particular body of laws (shir'ah orshari'ah) promulgated through them, and the way of life(minhaj) recommended by them, varied in accordance withthe exigencies of the time and of each community'scultural development. This \"unity in diversity\" isfrequently stressed in the Qur'an (e.g., in the firstsentence of  2:148 , in {21:92-93}, or in  23:52  ff.).Because of the universal applicability and textualincorruptibility of its teachings - as well as of thefact that the Prophet Muhammad is \"the seal of allprophets\", i.e., the last of them (see  33:40 ) - theQur'an represents the culminating point of all revelationand offers the final, perfect way to spiritualfulfilment. This uniqueness of the Qur'anic message doesnot, however, preclude all adherents of earlier faithsfrom attaining to God's grace: for - as the Qur'an sooften points out - those among them who believeuncompromisingly in the One God and the Day of Judgment(i.e., in individual moral responsibility) and liverighteously \"need have no fear, and neither shall theygrieve\"."

On the basis of this verse,some of the greatest Muslim scholars have concluded thatIslamic Law, in its entirety, consists of no more thanthe clear-cut injunctions forthcoming from theself-evident (zahir) wording of the Qur'an and theProphet's commandments, and that, consequently, it is notpermissible to extend the scope of such self-evidentordinances by means of subjective methods of deduction.(A most enlightening discussion of this problem is to befound in the Introduction to Ibn Hazm's Muhalla, vol. I,56 ff.) This, of course, does not prevent the Muslimcommunity from evolving, whenever necessary, any amountof additional, temporal legislation in accordance withthe spirit of the Qur'an and the teachings of theProphet: but it must be clearly understood that suchadditional legislation cannot be regarded as forming partof Islamic Law (the shari'ah) as such."

Then the Prophet said: \"Had I answered'yes', it would have become incumbent on you [to performthe pilgrimage every year]: and, indeed, it would havebeen beyond your ability to do so. Do not ask me aboutmatters which I leave unspoken: for, behold, there werepeople before you who went to their doom because they hadput too many questions to their prophets and thereupondisagreed [about their teachings]. Therefore, if Icommand you anything, do of it as much as you are able todo; and if I forbid you anything, abstain from it.\"Discussing this Tradition, Ibn Hazm observes: \"Itcircumscribes all the principles of religious law (ahkamad-din) from the first to the last - namely: what theProphet has left unspoken - neither ordering norforbidding it - is allowed (mubah), that is, neitherforbidden nor obligatory; whatever he ordered isobligatory (fard), and whatever he forbade is unlawful(haram); and whatever he ordered us to do is binding onus to the extent of our ability alone\" (Muhalla I, 64).It should be borne in mind that the term \"the Prophet\"comprises, in this context, the Qur'an as well, since itwas through the Prophet that the Qur'anic message wascommunicated to mankind."

Inasmuch as, on the face of it, thisreading would imply a fundamental doubt in God's power todo anything that He wills (an imputation which does notagree with the characterization, in the Qur'an, of Jesus'disciples as firm believers), most of the commentatorssee in the query of the disciples something similar toone person's asking another, \"Could you go with me?\" -that is to say, not implying a doubt as to the other'sability to go but, rather, an uncertainty as to hiswillingness to do it (cf. in this respect, Tabari,Baghawi, Razi, Raghib; also Manar VII, 250ff.). We have,however, positive evidence of the fact that several ofthe most outstanding Companions of the Prophet - 'Ali,Ibn 'Abbas, 'A'ishah and Mu'adh ibn Jabal - read thewords in question in the spelling hal tastati' rabbaka,which might be rendered as \"Couldst thou prevail upon thySustainer?\" (Tabari, Zamakhshari, Baghawi, Razi, IbnKathir): a reading which implies the disciples'uncertainty as to Jesus' ability (in the spiritual senseof this word) to make the above request of God. Thus,'A'ishah, refusing to accept the more common reading halyastati' rabbuka (\"can\" or \"could thy Sustainer\"), isreported to have said: \"The disciples of Jesus knewbetter than to ask whether God is able to do anything:they merely asked [of Jesus], 'Art thou able to requestthy Sustainer?'\" (Razi). Moreover, according to anauthentic Tradition quoted in the Mustadrak, Mu'adh ibnJabal stated unequivocally that the Prophet himself hadimparted to him the reading hal tastati' rabbaka(\"Couldst thou prevail upon thy Sustainer?\"). To my mind,the weight of evidence points to this second alternative:but in view of the more general reading, I have renderedthe phrase as above. As regards the disciples' request -and Jesus' subsequent prayer - for a heavenly \"repast\"(ma'idah, the word which gave the title to this surah),it might possibly be an echo of the request for dailybread contained in the Lord's Prayer (cf. Matthew vi,11), since, in religious terminology, every benefit thataccrues to man is \"sent down from heaven\" - that is, byGod - even if it comes into being through man's ownefforts. But, on the other hand, the manner in which thedisciples are said to have asked for the \"repast\" - andparticularly their explanation given in the next verse -rather seems to point to a request for a miracle whichwould assure them of God's \"acceptance\" of their faith.(See also next note.)"

It is generally assumed that thesevery beings or forces are addressed here; but the primarymeaning of the term ma'shar appearing in this contextwarrants, in my opinion, a different conclusion. It istrue that this term is often used to denote a group orcommunity or genus of sentient beings which have certaincharacteristics in common: a conventional - andundoubtedly justifiable - use based on the verb'asharahu, \"he consorted [or \"was on intimate terms\"]with him\" or \"lived in close communion with him\". But itis precisely this verbal origin of the term ma'shar whichgives us a clue as to what is really meant here. Since,in its primary significance, a person's ma'shar denotesthose who are on intimate terms or in close communionwith him (cf. Lisan al-'Arab: \"A man's ma'shar is hisfamily\"), we may well assume that it has a similarsignificance in the above Qur'anic phrase. Thus, to mymind, the allocution ya ma'shar al-jinn does not denote,\"O you community of [evil] invisible beings\" but, rather,\"O you who are [or \"have lived\"] in close communion with[evil] invisible beings\": in other words, it is addressedto the misguided human beings who have been seduced by\"glittering half-truths meant to delude the mind\" {verse112}. This interpretation is reinforced by the words,\"Have there not come unto you apostles from amongyourselves\", occurring in verse {130} below: for theQur'an speaks always only of apostles who belonged to thehuman race, and never of apostles from among the jinn.(As regards the wide significance of this latter term,see Appendix III.)"

Western scholars usually take it forgranted that the name \"Iblis\" is a corruption of theGreek word diabolos, from which the English \"devil\" isderived. There is, however, not the slightest evidencethat the pre-Islamic Arabs borrowed this or any othermythological term from the Greeks - while, on the otherhand, it is established that the Greeks derived a gooddeal of their mythological concepts (including variousdeities and their functions) from the much earlierSouth-Arabian civilization (cf. Encyclopaedia of Islam I,379 f.). One may, therefore, assume with somethingapproaching certainty that the Greek diabolos is aHellenized form of the Arabic name for the Fallen Angel,which, in turn, is derived from the root-verb ablasa, \"hedespaired\" or \"gave up hope\" or \"became broken in spirit\"(see Lane I, 248). The fact that the noun diabolos(\"slanderer\" - derived from the verb diaballein, \"tothrow [something] across\") is of genuinely Greek origindoes not, by itself, detract anything from thishypothesis: for it is conceivable that the Greeks, withtheir well-known tendency to Hellenize foreign names,identified the name \"Iblls\" with the, to them, much morefamiliar term diabolos. - As regards Iblis' statement, inthe next verse, that he had been created \"out of fire\",see surah {38}, note [60]."

In his earlierstate of innocence man was unaware of the existence ofevil and, therefore, of the ever-present necessity ofmaking a choice between the many possibilities of actionand behaviour: in other words, he lived, like all otheranimals, in the light of his instincts alone. Inasmuch,however, as this innocence was only a condition of hisexistence and not a virtue, it gave to his life a staticquality and thus precluded him from moral andintellectual development The growth of his consciousness- symbolized by the wilful act of disobedience to God'scommand - changed all this. It transformed him from apurely instinctive being into a full-fledged human entityas we know it - a human being capable of discerningbetween right and wrong and thus of choosing his way oflife. In this deeper sense, the allegory of the Fall doesnot describe a retrogressive happening but, rather, a newstage of human development: an opening of doors to moralconsiderations. By forbidding him to \"approach thistree\", God made it possible for man to act wrongly - andtherefore, to act rightly as well: and so man becameendowed with that moral free will which distinguishes himfrom all other sentient beings. - Regarding the role ofSatan - or Iblis - as the eternal tempter of man, seenote [26] on  2:34  and note [31] on  15:41 ."

As for the word jamaloccurring in this sentence, there is hardly any doubtthat its translation, in this context, as \"camel\" iserroneous. As pointed out by Zamakhshari (and confirmedby other classical commentators, including Razi), Ibn'Abbas used to read the word in the spelling jummal,which signifies \"a thick rope\" or \"a twisted cable\"; andthe same reading is attributed to 'Ali ibn Abi Talib (Tajal-'Arus). It is to be noted that there are also severalother dialectical spellings of this word, namely, jumal,juml, jumul and, finally, jamal (as in thegenerally-accepted version of the Qur'an) - all of themsignifying \"a thick, twisted rope\" (Jawhari), and all ofthem used in this sense by some of the Prophet'sCompanions or their immediate successors (tabi'un). Ibn'Abbas is also quoted by Zamakhshari as having said thatGod could not have coined so inappropriate a metaphor as\"a camel passing through a needle's eye\" - meaning thatthere is no relationship whatsoever between a camel and aneedle's eye whereas, on the other hand, there is adefinite relationship between the latter and a rope(which after all, is but an extremely thick thread). Onall accounts, therefore, the rendering of jamal as \"atwisted rope\" is, in this context, infinitely preferableto that of \"a camel\". The fact that the latter renderingoccurs in a somewhat similar phrase in the Greek versionof the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew xix, 24, Mark x, 25 andLuke xviii, 25) does not affect this contention. Oneshould remember that the Gospels were originally composedin Aramaic, the language of Palestine at the time ofJesus, and that those Aramaic texts are now lost. It ismore than probable that, owing to the customary absenceof vowel signs in Aramaic writing, the Greek translatormisunderstood the consonant spelling g-m-l (correspondingto the Arabic j-m-l), and took it to mean \"a camel\": amistake repeated since, with regard to the aboveQur'an-verse, by many Muslims and all non-Muslimorientalists as well."

On the basis of thisidiomatic usage, many commentators assume that the a'rafreferred to here are \"elevated places\", like the heightsof a wall or its ramparts, and identify it with the\"barrier\" (hijab) mentioned at the end of the precedingsentence. A far more likely interpretation, however, isforthcoming from the primary significance of the word'urf and its plural a'raf: namely, \"discernment\" and \"thefaculty of discernment\", respectively. Thisinterpretation has been adopted by some of the great,early commentators of the Qur'an, like Al-Hasan al-Basriand Az-Zajjaj, whose views Razi quotes with evidentapproval. They state emphatically that the expression'ala 'l-a'raf is synonymous with 'ala ma'rifah, that is,\"possessing knowledge\" or \"endowed with the faculty ofdiscernment\" (i.e., between right and wrong), and thatthe persons thus described are those who in theirlifetime were able to discern between right and wrong(\"recognizing each by its mark\"), but did not definitelyincline to either: in brief, the indifferent ones. Theirlukewarm attitude has prevented them from doing eithermuch good or much wrong - with the result that, as thenext sentence shows, they deserve neither paradise norhell.

And if you abstain [from making waron God and His Apostle], it will be for your own good;but if you revert to it, We shall revert [to defeatingyou] - and never will your army be of any avail to you,however great its numbers: for, behold, God is with thebelievers!\" As can be seen from this alternativerendering, the difference in interpretation pivots on thetropical meaning which one gives to the words fath(\"decision\" or \"victory\") and fi'ah (\"army\" or\"community\"). As regards the latter, it is to be borne inmind that its primary significance is \"a group\" or \"acongregated body of men\" - more or less synonymous withta'ifah or jama'ah; it can, therefore, be used to denote\"an army\" as well as \"a community\". Similarly, theexpression na'ud can be understood in either of two ways:namely, as meaning \"We shall revert [to defeating you]\" -or, as in my rendering, \"We shall revoke [Our promise ofaid]\" - addressed, in the one instance to theunbelievers, and in the other, to the believers. (For theuse of the verb 'ada in the sense of \"he revoked\", seeTaj al-'Arus; also Lane V, 2189.)

Thus, the verse must be understood as areminder to the Muslims that God will be with them onlyso long as they remain firm in faith and righteous inaction, and that, however large their community may be inthe future, they will be powerless unless they are truebelievers."

In order to understandthis passage correctly, we must read it in closeconjunction with the opening sentence, \"Inspire thebelievers to conquer all fear of death\", whereupon wearrive at the meaning given in my rendering: namely, anexhortation to the believers to conquer all fear of deathand to be so patient in adversity that they might be ableto overcome an enemy many times their number (Razi; seealso Manar X, 87). The concluding words of this verse -\"because they are people who cannot grasp it [i.e., thetruth]\" - can be understood in either of two ways: (a) asgiving an additional reason of the true believers'superiority over \"those who are bent on denying thetruth\" (alladhina kafaru), inasmuch as the latter, notbelieving in the eternal verities and in life afterdeath, cannot rise to that enthusiasm and readiness forself-sacrifice which distinguishes the true believers; or(b) as explaining that \"those who are bent on denying thetruth\" deny it simply because their spiritual deafnessand blindness prevents them from grasping it. To my mind,the second of these two interpretations is preferable,and particularly so in view of the fact that the Qur'anoften explains in these terms the attitude of \"those whodeny the truth\" (e.g., in  6:25 ,  7:179 ,  9:87 , etc.)."

According to these commentators, theabove sentence abolished the custom which was prevalentamong the early Muslims, whereby the ansar (\"the helpers\"- i.e., the newly-converted Muslims of Medina) concluded,individually, symbolic ties of brotherhood with themahajirin (\"the emigrants\" from Mecca), who, almostwithout exception, arrived at medina in a state ofcomplete destitution: ties of brotherhood, that is, whichentitled every muhajir to a share in the property of his\"brother\" from among the ansar, and, in the event of thelatter's death, to a share in the inheritance left byhim. The above verse is said to have prohibited sucharrangements by stipulating that only actual closerelations should henceforth have a claim to inheritance.To my mind, however, this interpretation is notconvincing. Although the expression ulu 'l-arham isderived from the noun rahm (also spelt rihm and rahim),which literally signifies \"womb\", one should not forgetthat it is tropically used in the sense of \"kinship\",\"relationship\" or \"close relationship\" in general (i.e.,not merely blood-relationship). Thus, \"in the classicallanguage, ulu 'l-arham means any relations: and in law,any relations that have no portion [of the inheritancestermed fara'id]\" (Lane III, 1056, citing, among otherauthorities, the Taj al-'Arus). In the present instance,the reference to \"close relations\" comes at the end of apassage which centres on the injunction that thebelievers must be \"the friends and protectors (awliya')of one another\", and that all later believers shall,similarly, be regarded as members of the Islamicbrotherhood. If the reference to \"close relations\" weremeant to be taken in its literal sense and conceived asalluding to laws of inheritance, it would be quite out oftune with the rest of the passage, which stresses thebonds of faith among true believers, as well as the moralobligations arising from these bonds. In my opinion,therefore, the above verse has no bearing on laws ofinheritance, but is meant to summarize, as it were, thelesson of the preceding verses: All true believers, ofall times, form one single community in the deepest senseof this word; and all who are thus closely related inspirit have the highest claim on one another inaccordance with God's decree that \"all believers arebrethren\" ( 49:10 )."

On the other hand, there exists a Traditionon the authority of 'Abd Allah ibn 'Umar to the effectthat the Prophet described in these very words the lastpilgrimage led by himself in 10 H. and known to historyas the Farewell Pilgrimage (Zamakhshari, Razi); one may,therefore, assume that it is this which is alluded tohere. If this assumption is correct, it would justify theconclusion that verses {3} and {4} of this surah wererevealed during the Farewell Pilgrimage, i.e., shortlybefore the Prophet's death. This might explain the -otherwise perplexing - statement, reliably attributed tothe Prophet's Companion Al-Bara' (Bukhari, Kitabat-Tafsir), that At-Tawbah was the last surah revealed tothe Prophet: for, although it is established beyond anydoubt that the surah as a whole was revealed in 9 H. andwas followed by several other parts of the Qur'an, e.g.,Al-Ma'idah, it is possible that what Al-Bara' had in mindwere only these two key-verses ({3} and {4}) ofAt-Tawbah, which conceivably were revealed during theFarewell Pilgrimage."

Secondly, the Qur'an ordains, \"Fight in God'scause against those who wage war against you; but do notcommit aggression, for verily, God does not loveaggressors\" ( 2:190 ); and, \"if they do not let you be,and do not offer you peace, and do not stay their hands,seize them and slay them whenever you come upon them: andit is against these that We have clearly empowered you[to make war]\" ( 4:91 ). Thus, war is permissible only inself-defence (see surah {2}, notes [167] and [168]), withthe further proviso that \"if they desist - behold, God ismuch-forgiving, a dispenser of grace\" ( 2:192 ), and \"ifthey desist, then all hostility shall cease\" ( 2:193 ).Now the enemy's conversion to Islam - expressed in thewords, \"if they repent, and take to prayer [lit.,\"establish prayer\"] and render the purifying dues(zakah)\" - is no more than one, and by no means the only,way of their \"desisting from hostility\"; and thereference to it in verses {5} and {11} of this surahcertainly does not imply an alternative of \"conversion ordeath\", as some unfriendly critics of Islam choose toassume. Verses {4} and {6} give a further elucidation ofthe attitude which the believers are enjoined to adopttowards such of the unbelievers as are not hostile tothem.

The term jizyah, rendered by me as \"exemptiontax\", occurs in the Qur'an only once, but its meaning andpurpose have been fully explained in many authenticTraditions. It is intimately bound up with the concept ofthe Islamic state as an ideological organization: andthis is a point which must always be borne in mind if thereal purport of this tax is to be understood. In theIslamic state, every able-bodied Muslim is obliged totake up arms in jihad (i.e., in a just war in God'scause) whenever the freedom of his faith or the politicalsafety of his community is imperilled: in other words,every able-bodied Muslim is liable to compulsory militaryservice. Since this is, primarily, a religious obligationnon-Muslim citizens, who do not subscribe to the ideologyof Islam, cannot in fairness be expected to assume asimilar burden. On the other hand, they must be accordedfull protection of all their civic rights and of theirreligious freedom: and it is in order to compensate theMuslim community for this unequal distribution of civicburdens that a special tax is levied on non-Muslimcitizens (ahl adh-dhimmah, lit., \"covenanted\" [or\"protected\"] people\", i.e., non-Muslims whose safety isstatutorily assured by the Muslim community). Thus,jizyah is no more and no less than an exemption tax inlieu of military service and in compensation for the\"covenant of protection\" (dhimmah) accorded to suchcitizens by the Islamic state. (The term itself isderived from the verb jaza \"he rendered [something] as asatisfaction\", or \"as a compensation [in lieu ofsomething else;\" - cf. Lane II, 422.) No fixed rate hasbeen set either by the Qur'an or by the Prophet for thistax; but from all available Traditions it is evident thatit is to be considerably lower than the tax called zakah(\"the purifying dues\") to which Muslims are liable andwhich - because it is a specifically Islamic religiousduty - is naturally not to be levied on non-Muslims. Onlysuch of the non-Muslim citizens who, if they wereMuslims, would be expected to serve in the armed forcesof the state are liable to the payment of jizyah,provided that they can easily afford it. Accordingly, allnon-Muslim citizens whose personal status or conditionwould automatically free them from the obligation torender military service are statutorily - that is, on thebasis of clear-cut ordinances promulgated by the Prophet- exempted from the payment of jizyah: (a) all women, (b)males who have not yet reached full maturity, (c) oldmen, (d) all sick or crippled men, (e) priests and monks.All non-Muslim citizens who volunteer for militaryservice are obviously exempted from the payment ofjizyah. My rendering of the expression 'an yad (lit.,\"out of hand\") as \"with a willing hand\", that is, withoutreluctance, is based on one of several explanationsoffered by Zamakhshari in his commentary on the aboveverse. Rashid Rida', taking the word yad in itsmetaphorical significance of \"power\" or \"ability\",relates the phrase 'an yad to the financial ability ofthe person liable to the payment of jizyah (see Manar X,342): an interpretation which is undoubtedly justified inview of the accepted definition of this tax."

As regards the belief attributed to the Jewsthat Ezra (or, in the Arabicized form of this name'Uzayr) was \"God's son\", it is to be noted that almostall classical commentators of the Our'an agree in thatonly the Jews of Arabia, and not all Jews, have been thusaccused. (According to a Tradition on the authority ofIbn 'Abbas - quoted by Tabari in his commentary on thisverse - some of the Jews of Medina once said to Muhammad,\"How could we follow thee when thou hast forsaken ourqiblah and dost not consider Ezra a son of God?\") On theother hand, Ezra occupies a unique position in the esteemof all Jews, and has always been praised by them in themost extravagant terms. It was he who restored andcodified the Torah after it had been lost during theBabylonian Exile, and \"edited\" it in more or less theform which it has today, and thus \"he promoted theestablishment of an exclusive, legalistic type ofreligion that became dominant in later Judaism\"(Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1963, vol. IX, p. 15). Eversince then he has been venerated to such a degree thathis verdicts on the Law of Moses have come to be regardedby the Talmudists as being practically equivalent to theLaw itself: which, in Qur'anic ideology, amounts to theunforgivable sin of shirk, inasmuch as it implies theelevation of a human being to the status of aquasi-divine law-giver and the blasphemous attribution tohim - albeit metaphorically - of the quality of \"sonship\"in relation to God. Cf. in this connection Exodus iv,22-23 (\"Israel is My son\") or Jeremiah xxxi, 9 (\"I am afather to Israel\"): expressions to which, because oftheir idolatrous implications, the Qur'an takes strongexception."

To guard againstsuch an assault, the prophet assembled the strongestforce the Muslims were capable of, and set out in themonth of Rajab, 9 H., towards the frontier. On reachingTabak, about half-way between Medina and Damascus, theProphet ascertained that the Byzantines were either notyet ready to invade Arabia or had entirely given up theidea for the time being; and so - in accordance with theIslamic principle that war may be waged only inself-defence - he returned with his followers to Medinawithout engaging in hostilities. At the time of thepreparation for this expedition, the hypocrites and aminority among the believers displayed an extremereluctance (referred to in this and the following verses)to embark on a war with Byzantium: and it is thisminority that the above verse reproaches for \"clingingheavily to the earth\" (Manar X 493)."

Cf. in this connection, \"Whoever pays heed unto theApostle pays heed unto God thereby\" ( 4:80 ), or, \"Say [OProphet]: 'If you love God, follow me, [and] God willlove you'\" ( 3:31 )."

From the very outsethe allied himself with the Prophet's enemies, the MeccanQuraysh, and took part on their side in the battle ofUhud (3 H.). Shortly thereafter he migrated to Syria anddid all that he could to induce the Emperor of Byzantium,Heraclius, to invade Medina and crush the Muslimcommunity once and for all. In Medina itself, Abu 'Amirhad some secret followers among the members of his tribe,with whom he remained in constant correspondence. In theyear 9 H. he informed them that Heraclius had agreed tosend out an army against Medina, and that large-scalepreparations were being made to this effect (which wasapparently the reason for the Prophet's preventiveexpedition to Tabak). In order that his followers shouldhave a rallying-place in the event of the expectedinvasion of Medina, Abu 'Amir suggested to his friendsthat they build a mosque of their own in the village ofQuba', in the immediate vicinity of Medina (which theydid), and thus obviate the necessity of congregating inthe mosque which the Prophet himself had built in thesame village at the time of his arrival at Medina (seenote [145] below). It is this \"rival\" mosque to which theabove verse refers. It was demolished at the Prophet'sorders immediately after his return from the Tabakexpedition. Abu 'Amir himself died in Syria shortlyafterwards. (For all the relevant Traditions, seeTabari's and Ibn Kathir's commentaries on this verse.)"

There are,however, authentic Traditions to the effect that theProphet applied the designation of \"a house of worshipfounded on God-consciousness\" to his (later-built) mosqueat Medina as well (Muslim, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, Ibn Hanbal).It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that it applies toevery mosque sincerely dedicated by its founders to theworship of God: a view which is supported by the nextverse."

This interpretation ofalladhina khullifu - applying, in the above context, tothose who remained behind under false pretences - has thesupport of some of the most outstanding Arabphilologists, e.g., 'Abd al-Malik al-Asma'i (as quoted byRazi, in his commentary on verse {83} of this surah). -As regards \"the three who had fallen prey to corruption\",the clasical commentators assume that it is a referenceto three persons - namely, Ka'b ibn Malik, Mararah ibnar-Rabi' and Hilal ibn Umayyah (all of them from amongthe ansar) - who abstained from the campaign and werethereafter ostracized by the Prophet and his Companionsuntil the revelation of the above verse.

In many of itsverses, the Qur'an calls upon the believer to observe allnature and to discern God's creative activity in itsmanifold phenomena and \"laws\", as well as to mediate uponthe lessons of history with a view to gaining a deeperinsight into man's motivations and the innermost springsof his behaviour; and, thus, the Qur'an itself ischaracterized as addressed to \"those who think\". Inshort, intellectual activity as such is postulated as avalid way to a better understanding of God's will and -if pursued with moral consciousness - as a valid methodof worshipping God. This Qur'anic principle has beenemphasized in many well-authenticated sayings of theProphet, for instance, \"Striving after knowledge is asacred duty (faridah) for every man and woman who hassurrendered himself or herself to God (muslimwa-muslimah)\" (Ibn Majah); or, \"The superiority (fadl) ofa learned man over a [mere] worshipper [i.e., one whomerely prays, fasts, etc.] is like the superiority of thefull moon over all the stars\" (Tirmidhi, Abu Da'ud, IbnMajah, Ibn Hanbal, Darimi).

There is no idiomatic equivalent inmodern English to convey this meaning. The nearestapproach to it would be, I believe, the archaicexclamation \"alack\", expressive of deep sorrow orreproach; but the use of this expression (probably acompound of \"ah! lack!\" - i.e., loss or misfortune) isruled out by its obsoleteness.

In the context of the passage which weare now considering, the mention of Jonah's people - whoalone among the communities of the past heeded theirprophet before it was too late - is meant to warn thehearers and readers of the Qur'an that a deliberaterejection of its message by \"those against whom God'sword [of judgment] has come true\" (see verse {96}) isbound to result in their spiritual doom and,consequently, in grievous suffering in the life to come."

Although the story of Noah had beenvaguely known to the Arabs even before the advent of theProphet Muhammad, they - and the Prophet with them - wereentirely unaware of the details as narrated in thepreceding Qur'anic account (Razi). The use of the pluralat the beginning of this parenthetic passage (\"Theseaccounts\") - in contrast with the singular form employedin a similar phrase occurring in  3:44 ,  11:100  and 12:102  (\"This account\") - seems, in my opinion, toindicate that it refers not only to the preceding storyof Noah but also to the subsequent stories of otherprophets. In this connection it should be remembered -and it cannot be stressed too often - that \"narrative\" assuch is never the purpose of the Qur'an. Whenever itrelates the stories of earlier prophets, or alludes toancient legends or to historical events that took placebefore the advent of Islam or during the lifetime of theProphet, the aim is, invariably, a moral lesson; andsince one and the same event, or even legend, has usuallymany facets revealing as many moral implications, theQur'an reverts again and again to the same stories, butevery time with a slight variation of stress on this orthat aspect of the fundamental truths underlying theQur'anic revelation as a whole."

Thestress here is on the intrinsic impossibility ofreconciling belief in the One God, whose omniscience andomnipotence embraces all that exists, with an attributionof divine or semi-divine qualities and functions toanyone or anything else. The subtly-veiled suggestion ofthe Thamud (see note [92]) and its rejection by Salih hasa bearing on all religious attitudes based on a desire to\"bring God closer to man\" through the interposition ofalleged \"mediators\" between Him and man. In primitivereligions, this interposition led to the deification ofvarious forces of nature and, subsequently, to theinvention of imaginary deities which were thought to actagainst the background of an undefined, dimly-perceivedSupreme Power (for instance, the Moira of the ancientGreeks). In higher religious concepts, this need formediation assumes the form of personified manifestationsof God through subordinate deities (as is the case, inHinduism, with the personifications of the AbsoluteBrahma of the Upanishads and the Vedanta in the forms ofVishnu or Shiva), or in His supposed incarnation in humanform (as represented in the Christian idea of Jesus as\"God's son\" and the Second Person of the Trinity). And,lastly, God is supposedly \"brought closer to man\" by theinterposition of a hierarchy of saints, living or dead,whose intercession is sought even by people who considerthemselves to be \"monotheists\" - and this includes manymisguided Muslims who do not realize that their belief insaints as \"mediators\" between men and God conflicts withthe very essence of Islam. The ever-recurring Qur'anicstress on the oneness and uniqueness of God, and thecategorical denial of the idea that anyone or anything -whether it be a concrete being or an abstract force -could have the least share in God's qualities or theleast influence on the manner in which He governs theuniverse aims at freeing man from the self-imposedservitude to an imaginary hierarchy of \"mediatingpowers\", and at making him realize that \"wherever youturn there is God's countenance\" (2:115), and that God is\"[always] near, responding [to the call of whoever callsunto Him]\" ( 2:186 ; also, in a condensed form, in verse{61} of this surah)."

But there is also a strong probability, pointedout by Zamakhshari and Razi, that the term sijjil is ofpurely Arabic origin - namely, a synonym of sijjil, whichprimarily signifies \"a writing\", and secondarily,\"something that has been decreed\": in which case theexpression hijarah min sijjil can be understood in ametaphorical sense, namely, as \"stones of all thechastisement laid down in God's decree\" (Zamakhshari andRazi, both in conjunction with the above verse and intheir commentaries on  105:4 ). It is, I believe, thismetaphorical meaning of \"stone-hard blows of chastisementpre-ordained\", i.e., of God-willed doom, that theconcluding sentence of the next verse alludes to."

It is obvious, however,that the purport of this passage and of its sequence goesfar beyond anything that might be construed by a purely\"historical\" interpretation. What this version ofShu'ayb's story aims at is - as always in the Qur'an -the enunciation of a generally applicable principle ofethics: namely, the impossibility of one's beingrighteous with regard to God unless one is righteous - inboth the moral and social senses of this word - in therealm of human relationships as well.

It should be borne in mind that theverb qassa (the infinitive nouns of which are qasas andiqtisas) signifies, primarily, \"he followed step by step\"or \"by degrees\", and, subsequently, \"he related [a pieceof news or a story] as though he followed its traces\":hence, \"he expounded [it] gradually\" or \"he explained[it]\" (cf. Lane VII, 2526, quoting the Qamus and the Tajal-'Arus with specific reference to the above verse). If,on the other hand, the infinitive noun qasas is regardedas synonymous, in this context, with qis,sah (\"story\" or\"narrative\"), the above sentence might be rendered as \"Wenarrate unto thee the best of narratives\", i.e., thesubsequent story of Joseph. In my opinion, however, therendering \"We explain it [i.e., the Qur'an] in the bestpossible way\" is preferable inasmuch as it fullycoincides with the two opening verses of this surah,which state, in effect, that the Qur'an isself-explanatory."

This is, to my mind, much moreconvincing than a mere reference to dream-interpretation,the more so as the term ta'wil is often used in theQur'an (e.g., in  3:7 ,  10:39  or  18:78 ) in the senseof \"final meaning\", \"inner meaning\" or \"real meaning\" ofa happening or statement or thing, as distinct from itsoutward, prima-facie appearance. The use of the particlemin (\"of\") before the term ta'wil indicates that absoluteknowledge of what a thing or event implies rests with Godalone (cf.  3:7  - \"none save God knows its finalmeaning\"), and that even God's elect, the prophets -albeit their vision is much wider than that of ordinarymen - are granted only a partial insight into themysteries of God's creation."

This extremely plausible explanationcontrasts sharply with the Biblical account of thisincident (Genesis xliv), according to which the falseaccusation was part of an inexplicable \"stratagem\"devised by Joseph. If we discard - as we must - this partof the Biblical version, it is far more logical to assumethat Joseph who had been granted by the King fullauthority over all that belonged to the latter (see verse{56} above), had placed the royal cup as a present in thebag of his favourite brother; and that he did thissecretly, without informing his servants, because he didnot want anyone, least of all his ten half-brothers, toknow his predilection for Benjamin.

                "text": "Lit., \"from God's command (amr)\". The rendering of theabove passage hinges on the meaning given to the termmu'aqqibat - a double plural of mu'aqqib, which signifies\"something that comes immediately after another thing\" or\"succeeds another thing without interruption\". Most ofthe classical commentators understand by mu'aqqibat\"hosts of angels\", i.e., the recording angels who attendon every human being, succeeding one another withoutinterruption. Consequently, they interpret the phrase minbayni yadayhi wa-min khalfihi as meaning \"ranged beforehim and behind him\", i.e., surrounding man from allsides; and they explain the words \"from God's command\" asbeing here synonymous with \"by God's command\", and takethem to refer to the angels or to their function ofguardianship. However, this interpretation has by nomeans the support of all the commentators. Some of theearliest ones assume that the term mu'aqqibat refers toall manner of worldly forces or concepts on which man sooften relies in the mistaken belief that they might helphim to achieve his aims independently of God's will: andthis is the meaning given to this elliptic passage by thefamous commentator Abu Muslim al-Isfahani, as quoted byRazi. Explaining verse {10} and the first part of verse{11}, he says: \"All alike are, in God's knowledge, deedsdone secretly or openly, as well as he who hides in thedarkness of night and he who walks [boldly] in the lightof day...: for he that resorts to the [cover of] nightcan never elude God's will (amr), just as he [cannot]that walks in the light of day, surrounded by hosts ofhelpers (mu'aqqibat) - that is, guards and aids - meantto protect him: [for] those guards of his cannot save himfrom [the will of] God.\" It is on this convincinginterpretation that I have based my rendering. Theworldly \"guards and aids\" on which a sinner relies may betangible (like wealth, progeny, etc.) or intangible (likepersonal power, high social standing, or the belief inone's \"luck\"): and this explains the phrase \"both such ascan be perceived by him and such as are hidden from him\"(see preceding note)."

Many commentators, taking the primary meaning ofatraf, are of the opinion that the above sentence relatesto the struggle between the early Muslim community atMedina and the pagans of Mecca, and interpret it thus:\"Do they [i.e., the pagans of Mecca] not see that we arevisiting [with Our punishment] the land [held by them],gradually curtailing it from [all] its sides?\" - whichwould imply a prophecy of the gradual conquest of allArabia by the Muslims. Other commentators, however,prefer the secondary meaning of atraf and - withoutdenying its relevance to the early history of Islam -interpret this passage in a more general sense, similarto the rendering adopted by me. Thus, for instance, Razi:\"Have they [i.e., the deniers of the truth] never yetseen the turns of fortune (ikhtilafat) that take place inthis world - destruction after prosperity, death afterlife, humiliation after glory, deficiency afterperfection?... Hence, what makes those deniers of thetruth so sure that God will not render them abject afterthey had been mighty, and subjected [by others] afterthey had been rulers?\" Thus, in its widest sense, thephrase \"gradually depriving it of all that is best in it\"may be taken to relate not merely to physical and socialcatastrophes but also to the loss of all ethical values -and, thus, to the loss of all worldly power - which\"those who are bent on denying the truth\" are bound tosuffer in the end."

In hiscommentary on the above verse, Zamakhshari stresses thisaspect of free choice on the part of man and points outthat \"God does not cause anyone to go astray except onewho, as He knows, will never attain to faith; and He doesnot guide anyone aright except one who, as He knows, willattain to faith.

Thus, He does not forsake anyoneexcept those who deserve to be forsaken, and does notbestow His favour upon anyone except those who deserve tobe favoured.\" Commenting on the identical phraseoccurring in  16:93 , Zamakhshari states: \"[God] forsakeshim who, as He knows, will [consciously] choose to denythe truth and will persevere in this [denial]; and...Hebestows His favour upon him who, as He knows, will choosefaith: which means that He makes the issue dependent on[man's] free choice (al-ikhtiyar), and thus on hisdeserving either [God's] favour or the withdrawal of[His] aid...and does not make it dependent on compulsion[i.e., predestination], which would rule out [man's]deserving anything of the above.\""

The term ,salsal, occurringin three verses of this surah as well as in  55:14 , addsa further dimension to this concept. According to most ofthe philological authorities, it denotes \"dried clay thatemits a sound\" (i.e., when it is struck); and since it isused in the Qur'an exclusively with reference to thecreation of man, it seems to contain an allusion to thepower of articulate speech which distinguishes man fromall other animal species, as well as to the brittlenessof his existence (cf. the expression \"like pottery\" in 55:14 ). As the construction of the sentence shows, thissalsal is stated to have evolved (Razi) out of hama' -which, according to some authorities, is the plural ofham'ah, signifying \"dark, fetid mud\" or \"dark slime\" -while the participial adjective masnun which qualifiesthis noun denotes, as Razi points out, both \"altered\"(i.e., in its composition) and \"brought into shape\":hence my rendering of this expression as \"transmuted\",which to some extent combines both of the above meanings.To my mind, we have here a description of the primevalbiological environment out of which the \"sounding clay\" -the matrix, as it were - of man's physical body hasevolved in accordance with God's plan of creation."

Since, as Ihave mentioned, these designations of other-worldlysuffering are obviously allegorical, we may also assumethat the \"seven gates of hell\" have the same character,and signify \"seven approaches [or \"ways\"] to hell\".Furthermore, it is well known that in the Semiticlanguages - and most particularly in classical Arabic -the number \"seven\" is often used in the sense of\"several\" or \"various\" (cf.

                "text": "The term 'arsh (lit., \"throne\" or, more properly, \"seatof power\") is used in the Qur'an to denote God's absolutesway over all that exists; hence, the expression dhu'l-'arsh may be suitably rendered as \"He who is enthronedin His almightiness\". Beyond this, the commentators arenot entirely agreed as to the purport of the abovesentence. Some take it to mean that \"had there been otherdeities apart from God, they would endeavour to depriveHim of some or all of His power, and would thus createchaos in the universe\". Others - and most prominentlyamong them Tabarl and Ibn Kathlr - have a far better,though somewhat more complicated explanation to offer.Starting from the legitimate assumption that those whobelieve in the existence of other deities or divinepowers apart from God regard them as no more thanmediators between man and Him, the argument runs thus: Ifthose alleged divine or semi-divine \"mediators\" wouldreally exist, then it is obvious that, being no more thanmediators, even they would have to recognize Him as theSupreme Being - which would amount to admitting that theyhave no power of their own but are, in the last resort,entirely dependent on and subject to Him: and thisunavoidable conclusion implies a negation of any divinityin those imaginary \"mediators\". This being so, is it notfar more reasonable for man to turn directly to God, whois almighty, all-seeing, all-hearing, and has thereforeno need of any mediator?"

Since the earlierprophets invariably appealed to their own community andtheir own time alone, their teachings were, of necessity,circumscribed by the social and intellectual conditionsof that particular community and time; and since thepeople to whom they addressed themselves had not yetreached the stage of independent thinking, those prophetsstood in need of symbolic portents or miracles (see surah{6}, note [94]) in order to make the people concernedrealize the inner truth of their mission. The message ofthe Qur'an, on the other hand, was revealed at a timewhen mankind (and, in particular, that part of it whichinhabited the regions marked by the earlier,Judaeo-Christian religious development) had reached adegree of maturity which henceforth enabled it to graspan idealogy as such without the aid of those persuasiveportents and miraculous demonstrations which in the past,as the above verse points out, only too often gave riseto new, grave misconceptions."

Thesubsequent parable of Moses and his quest for knowledge(verses {6-82}) has become, in the course of time, thenucleus of innumerable legends with which we are notconcerned here. We have, however, a Tradition on theauthority of Ubayy ibn Ka'b (recorded in several versionsby Bukhari, Muslim and Tirmidhi), according to whichMoses was rebuked by God for having once asserted that hewas the wisest of all men, and was subsequently toldthrough revelation that a \"servant of God\" who lived atthe \"junction of the two seas\" was far superior to him inwisdom. When Moses expressed his eagerness to find thatman, God commanded him to \"take a fish in a basket\" andto go on and on until the fish would disappear: and itsdisappearance was to be a sign that the goal had beenreached. - There is no doubt that this Tradition is akind of allegorical introduction to our Qur'anic parable.The \"fish\" mentioned in the latter as well as in theabove-mentioned hadith is an ancient religious symbol,possibly signifying divine knowledge or life eternal. Asfor the \"junction of the two seas\", which many of theearly commentators endeavoured to \"identify\" ingeographical terms (ranging from the meeting of the RedSea and the Indian Ocean at the Bab al-Mandab to that ofthe Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean at theStraits of Gibraltar), Baydawi offers, in his commentaryon verse {60}, a purely allegorical explanation: the \"twoseas\" represent the two sources or streams of knowledge -the one obtainable through the observation andintellectual coordination of outward phenomena ('ilmaz-zahir), and the other through intuitive, mysticinsight ('ilm al-batin) - the meeting of which is thereal goal of Moses' quest."

Theclassical commentators incline to the first of thesemeanings (\"the Two-Horned\"); and in this they appear tohave been influenced by the ancient Middle-Easternimagery of \"horns\" as symbols of power and greatness,although the Qur'an itself does not offer any warrant forthis interpretation. In fact, the term -qarn (and itsplural qurun) occurs in the Qur'an-apart from thecombination Dhu 'l-Qarnayn appearing in verses {83}, {86}and {94} of this surah - twenty times: and each time ithas the meaning of \"generation\" in the sense of peoplebelonging to one particular epoch or civilization.However, since the allegory of Dhu 'l-Qarnayn is meant toillustrate the qualities of a powerful and just ruler, itis possible to assume that this designation is an echo ofthe above-mentioned ancient symbolism, which-beingfamiliar to the Arabs from very early times-had acquiredidiomatic currency in their language long before theadvent of Islam. Within the context of our Qur'anicallegory, the \"two horns\" may be taken to denote the twosources of power with which Dhu 'l-Qarnayn is said tohave been endowed: namely, the worldly might and prestigeof kingship as well as the spiritual strength resultingfrom his faith in God. This last point is extremelyimportant- for it is precisely the Qur'anic stress on hisfaith in God that makes it impossible to identify Dhu'l-Qarnayn, as most of the commentators do, withAlexander the Great (who is represented on some of hiscoins with two horns on his head) or with one or anotherof the pre-Islamic, Himyaritic kings of Yemen. All thosehistoric personages were pagans and worshipped aplurality of deities as a matter of course, whereas ourDhu 'l-Qarnayn is depicted as a firm believer in the OneGod: indeed, it is this aspect of his personality thatprovides the innermost reason of the Qur'anic allegory.We must, therefore, conclude that the latter has nothingto do with history or even legend, and that its solepurport is a parabolic discourse on faith and ethics,with specific reference to the problem of worldly power(see the concluding passage in the introductory note tothis surah)."

This\"identification\" is mainly based on a well-authenticatedTradition - recorded by Ibn Hanbal, Bukhari and Muslim -which tells us that the Apostle of God had a propheticdream to which he referred on awakening, with anexclamation of distress: \"There is no deity save God! Woeunto the Arabs from a misfortune that is approaching: alittle gap has been opened today in the rampart of Gogand Magog!\" Ever since the late Middle Ages, Muslims havebeen inclined to discern in this dream a prediction ofthe great Mongol invasion in the thirteenth century,which destroyed the Abbasid Empire and, thus, thepolitical power of the Arabs. However, the mention, inverses {99-101} of this surah, of \"the Day\" - i.e., theDay of Judgment - in connection with \"Gog and Magog\"shows that \"the time appointed by my Sustainer\" relatesto the coming of the Last Hour, when all works of manwill be destroyed. But since none of the Qur'anicreferences to the \"approach\" or the \"nearness\" of theLast Hour has anything to do with the human concept oftime, it is possible to accept both of the aboveinterpretations as equally valid in the sense that the\"coming of the Last Hour\" comprises an indefinite - and,in human terms, perhaps even immensely long- span oftime, and that the break-through of the godless forces of\"Gog and Magog\" was to be one of the signs of itsapproach. And, finally, it is most logical to assume(especially on the basis of {21: 96-97}) that the termsYajuj and Majuj are purely allegorical, applying not toany specific tribes or beings but to a series of socialcatastrophes which would cause a complete destruction ofman's civilization before the coming of the Last Hour."

It goes without saying that thisattitude (which has reached its epitome in the modernstatement that \"religion is opium for the people\") isdiametrically opposed to the demand, voiced by everyhigher religion, that man's social life, if it is to be atruly \"good\" life, must be subordinated to definiteethical principles and restraints. By their very nature,these restraints inhibit the unprincipled power-drivewhich dominates the more materialistic societies andenables them to achieve - without regard to the damagedone to others and, spiritually, to themselves - outwardcomforts and positions of strength in the shortestpossible time: but precisely because they do act as abrake on man's selfishness and power-hunger, it is thesemoral considerations and restraints - and they alone -that can free a community from the interminable,self-destructive inner tensions and frustrations to whichmaterialistic societies are subject, and thus bring abouta more enduring, because more organic, state of socialwell-being.

(As already mentioned in the preceding note,Razi unreservedly subsrcibes to Abu Muslim'sintepretation of this passage.)  In my opinion, theSamaritan's rejection of a part of Moses' teachings ismeant to explain the subconscious tendency underlying allforms of idolatry and of the attribution of divinequalities to things or beings other than God: a futile,self-deceiving hope of bringing the Unpercievable closerto one's limited perception by creating a tangible\"image\" of the Divine Being or, at least, of somethingthat could be conceived as His \"emanation\".  Inasmuch asall such endeavours obscure rather than illuminate man'sunderstanding of God, they defeat their own purpose anddestroy the misguided devotee's spiritual potential: andthis is undoubtedly the purport of the story of thegolden calf as given in the Qur'an."

However, the fact that a good many Companionsand their immediate successors (tabi'un) fully agreed onthe substance of the story, differing only in one or twoinsignificant details' seems to indicate that at thatperiod it was already well-established in ancient Arabiantradition (cf. note [77] below). According to this story,a flock of sheep strayed at night into a neighbouringfield and destroyed its crop.  The case was broughtbefore King David for judicial decision. On finding thatthe incident was due to the negligence of the owner ofthe sheep, David awarded the whole flock - the value ofwhich corresponded roughly to the extent of the damage -as an indemnity to the owner of the field.  David's youngson, Solomon, regarded this judgement as too severe,inasmuch as the sheep represented the defendant'scapital, whereas the damage was of a transitory nature,involving no more than the loss of one year's crop, i.e.,of income.  He therefore suggested to his father that thejudgement should be altered: the owner of the fieldshould have the temporary possession and usufruct of thesheep (sheep, wool, new-born lambs, etc.), while theirowner should tend the damaged field until it was restoredto its former productivity, whereupon both the field andthe flock of sheep would revert to their erstwhileowners; in this way the plaintiff would be fullycompensated for his loss without depriving the defendantof his substance.  David realized taht his son'd solutionof the case was better than his own, and passed judgementaccordingly; but since he, no less than Solomon, had beeninspired by a deep sense of justice, God - in the wordsof the Qur'an - \"bore witness to their judgement\"."

But since this term has occasionally been usedby pre-Islamic Arabs in the sense of \"mail\" or \"coats ofmail\" (ibid.), the classical commentators assume that ithas this meaning in the above context as well; and inthis they rely on the - otherwise unsupported - statementof the tabi'i Qatadah to the effect that \"David was thefirst to make chain mail\" (Tabari). Accordingly, theyunderstand the term ba's which occurs at the end of thesentence in its secondary sense of \"war\" or \"warlikeviolence\", and interpret the relevant part of the versethus: \"We taught him how to make coats of mail for you,so that they might fortify you against your [mutual actsof] violence\", or \"against [the effects of] your warlikeviolence\". One should, however, bear in mind that ba'ssignifies also \"harm\", \"misfortune\", \"distress\", etc., aswell as \"danger\"; hence it denotes, it its widest sense,anything that causes distress or fear (Taj al-'Arus). Ifwe adopt this last meaning, the term labus may beunderstood in its primary significance of \"garment\" - inthis case, the metaphorical \"garment ofGod-consciousness\" (libas at-taqwa) of which the Qur'anspeaks in  7:26 . Rendered in this sense, the above verseexpresses the idea that the Almighty taught David how toimbue his followers with that deep God-consciousnesswhich frees men from all spiritual distress and allfears, whether it be fear of one another or thesubconscious fear of the Unknown. The concludingrhetorical question, \"but are you grateful [for thisboon]?\" implies that, as a rule, man does not fullyrealize - and, hence, is not really grateful for- thespiritual bounty thus offered him by God."

Because they were so deeply ingrainedin the imagination of the people to whom the Qur'anaddressed itself in the first instance, these legendaryaccounts of Solomon's wisdom and magic powers hadacquired a cultural reality of their own and were,therefore, eminently suited to serve as a medium for theparabolic exposition of certain ethical truths with whichthis book is concerned: and so, without denying orconfirming their mythical character, the Qur'an uses themas a foil for the idea that God is the ultimate source ofall human power and glory, and that all achievements ofhuman ingenuity, even though they may sometimes border onthe miraculous, are but an expression of Histranscendental creativity."

I am,therefore, of the opinion that we have here (as in theidentical expression in  38:48 ) a generic term applyingto every one of the prophets, inasmuch as each of thempledged himself unreservedly to God and accepted theresponsibility for delivering His message to man."

                "text": "This allegorical expression, used here with reference toMary's conception of Jesus, has been widely - anderroneously - interpreted as relating specifically to hisbirth. As a matter of fact, the Qur'an uses the sameexpression in three other places with reference to thecreation of man in general - namely in {15 :29} and 38:72 , \"when I have formed him... and breathed into himof My spirit\"; and in  32:9 , \"and thereupon He forms[lit., \"formed\"] him fully and breathes [lit.,\"breathed\"] into him of His spirit\". In particular, thepassage of which the last-quoted phrase is a part (i.e.,{32:7-9}) makes it abundantly and explicitly clear thatGod \"breathes of His spirit\" into every human being.Commenting on the verse under consideration, Zamakhsharistates that \"the breathing of the spirit [of God] into abody signifies the endowing it with life\": an explanationwith which Razi concurs. (In this connection, see alsonote [181] on  4:171 .) As for the description of Mary asallati ahsanat farjaha, idiomatically denoting \"one whoguarded her chastity\" (lit., \"her private parts\"), it isto be borne in mind that the term ihsan - lit., \"[one's]being fortified [against any danger or evil]\" - has thetropical meaning of \"abstinence from what is unlawful orreprehensible\" (Tarj al-'Arus), and especially fromillicit sexual intercourse, and is applied to a man aswell as a woman: thus, for instance, the terms muhsan andmuhsanah are used elsewhere in the Qur'an to describe,respectively, a man or a woman who is \"fortified [bymarriage] against unchastity\". Hence, the expressionallati ahsanat farjaha, occurring in the above verse aswell as in {66: 12} with reference to Mary, is but meantto stress her outstanding chastity and completeabstinence, in thought as well as in deed, from anythingunlawful or morally reprehensible: in other words, arejection of the calumny (referred to in  4:156  andobliquely alluded to in {19:27-28}) that the birth ofJesus was the result of an \"illicit union\"."

Nor isthis the only objection to the above-mentionedinterpretation. Since the Qur'an applies the term\"believers\" to men and women alike, and since the termazwaj (\"spouses\"), too, denotes both the male and thefemale partners in marriage, there is no reason forattributing to the phrase aw ma malakat aymanuhum themeaning of \"their female slaves\"; and since, on the otherhand, it is out of the question that female and maleslaves could have been referred to here, it is obviousthat this phrase does not relate to slaves at all, buthas the same meaning as in  4:24 - namely, \"those whomthey rightfully possess through wedlock\" (see note [26]on  4:24 ) - with the significant difference that in thepresent context this expression relates to both husbandsand wives, who \"rightfully possess\" one another by virtueof marriage. On the basis of this interpretation, theparticle aw which precedes this clause does not denote analternative (\"or\") but is, rather, in the nature of anexplanatory amplification, more or less analgous to thephrase \"in other words\" or \"that is\", thus giving to thewhole sentence the meaning, \"...save with their spouses -that is, those whom they rightfully possess [throughwedlock]...\", etc. (Cf. a similar construction 25:62 -\"for him who has the will to take thought - that is[lit., \"or\"], has the will to be grateful\".)"

It is in this sense that the greatcommentator Abu Muslim (as quoted by Razi) explains theabove verse, which stresses the fact that both partnersare equally guilty inasmuch as they commit their sinconsciously - implying that neither of them can excusehimself or herself on the ground of having been merely\"seduced\"."

Since such a completeevidence is extremely difficult, if not impossible, toobtain, it is obvious that the purpose of the aboveQur'anic injunction is to preclude, in practice, allthird-party accusations relating to illicit sexualintercourse - for, \"man has been created weak\" ({4: 28})- and to make a proof of adultery dependent on avoluntary, faith-inspired confession of the guiltyparties themselves."

The Prophet's wife 'A'ishah, who hadaccompanied him on that expedition, was inadvertentlyleft behind when the Muslims struck camp before dawn.After having spent several hours alone, she was found byone of the Prophet's Companions, who led her to the nexthalting-place of the army.

According to mostof the classical commentators, it was worn in pre-Islamictimes more or less as an ornament and was let downloosely over the wearer's back; and since, in accordancewith the fashion prevalent at the time, the upper part ofa woman's tunic had a wide opening in the front, herbreasts were left bare. Hence, the injunction to coverthe bosom by means of a khimar (a term so familiar to thecontemporaries of the Prophet) does not necessarilyrelate to the use of khimar as such but is, rather, meantto make it clear that a woman's breasts are not includedin the concept of \"what may decently be apparent\" of herbody and should not, therefore, be displayed."

The number \"three\" usedtwice in this context is not, of course, enumerative orexclusive, but is obviously meant to stress the recurrentnature of the occasions on which even the most familiarmembers of the household, including husbands, wives andchildren, must respect that privacy."

To my mind, however, thisinterpretation conflicts not only with the immediatelypreceding passages but with the tenor of the Qur'an as awhole, which insists throughout on man's responsibilityfor (and, hence, on relative freedom in) choosing betweenright and wrong - and this side by side with its stresson God's unlimited power to determine the factual courseof events.

But on the vagueassumption that this passage is addressed exclusively tothe Prophet, some commentators incline to the view thatthe noun has here a specific, purely physicalconnotation-\"a place of return\"-allegedly referring toGod's promise to His Apostle (given during or after thelatter's exodus from Mecca to Medina) that one day hewould return victoriously to the city of his birth. To mymind, however, the passage has a much deeper meaning,unconnected with any place or specific point in history:it is addressed to every believer, and promises not onlya continuation of life after bodily death but also aspiritual rebirth, in this world, to anyone who opens hisheart to the message of the Qur'an and comes to regard itas binding on himself."

Tropically, the term munafiqdescribes a person who is \"two-faced\", inasmuch as healways tries to find an easy way out of any realcommitment, be it spiritual or social, by adapting hiscourse of action to what promises to be of practicaladvantage to him in the situation in which he happens tofind himself. Since a person thus characterized usuallypretends to be morally better than he really is, theepithet munafiq may roughly be rendered as \"hypocrite\".It should, however, be noted that whereas this Westernterm invariably implies conscious dissembling with theintent to deceive others, the Arabic term mun afiq mayalso be applied - and occasionally is applied in theQur'an - to a person who, being weak or uncertain in hisbeliefs or moral convictions, merely deceives himself.Hence, while using in my rendering of the Qur'anic textthe conventional expression \"hypocrite\", I haveendeavoured to point out the above differentiation,whenever possible and necessary, in my explanatory notes."

At thetime of the revelation of this surah - about the seventhyear before the hijrah, corresponding to 615 or 616 ofthe Christian era - the total destruction of theByzantine Empire seemed imminent. The few Muslims aroundthe Prophet were despondent on hearing the news of theutter discomfiture of the Byzantines, who were Christiansand, as such, believed in the One God. The pagan Quraysh,on the other hand, sympathized with Persians who, theythought, would vindicate their own opposition to theOne-God idea. When Muhammad enunciated the aboveQur'an-verses predicting a Byzantine victory \"within afew years\", this prophecy was received with derision bythe Quraysh. Now the term bid' (commonly rendered as \"afew\") denotes any number between three and ten; and, asit happened, in 622 - i.e., six or seven years after theQur'anic prediction - the tide turned in favour of theByzantines. In that year, Emperor Heraclius succeeded indefeating the Persians at Issus, south of the TaurusMountains, and subsequently drove them out of Asia Minor.By 624, he carried the war into Persian territory andthus put the enemy on the defensive; and in the beginningof December, 626, the Persian armies were completelyrouted by the Byzantines."

With reference to God, who is\"sublimely exalted above anything that men may devise byway of definition\" (see  6:100  and the correspondingnote [88]), the expression mathal clearly points to aquality of being entirely different from all othercategories of existence, inasmuch as there is \"nothinglike unto Him\" ( 42:11 ) and \"nothing that could becompared with Him\" ( 112:4 ): hence, the rendering ofmathal as \"essence\" is most appropriate in this context."

                "text": "This is the earliest mention of the term and concept ofriba in the chronology of Qur'anic revelation. In itsgeneral, linguistic sense, this term denotes an\"addition\" to or an \"increase\" of a thing over and aboveits original size or amount; in the terminology of theQur'an, it signifies any unlawful addition, by way ofinterest, to a sum of money or goods lent by one personor body of persons to another. Considering the problem interms of the economic conditions prevailing at or beforetheir time, most of the early Muslim jurists identifiedthis \"unlawful addition\" with profits obtained throughany kind of interest-bearing loans irrespective of therate of interest and the economic motivation involved.With all this - as is evidenced by the voluminousjuridical literature on this subject - Islamic scholarshave not yet been able to reach an absolute agreement onthe definition of riba: a definition, that is, whichwould cover all conceivable legal situations andpositively respond to all the exigencies of a variableeconomic environment. In the words of Ibn Kathir (in hiscommentary on  2:275 ), \"the subject of riba is one ofthe most difficult subjects for many of the scholars (ahlal-'ilm)\". It should be borne in mind that the passagecondemning and prohibiting riba in legal terms({2:275-281}) was the last revelation received by theProphet, who died a few days later (cf. note [268] on 2:281 ; hence, the Companions had no opportunity to askhim about the shar'i implications of the relevantinjunction - so much so that even 'Umar ibn al-Khattab isreliably reported to have said: \" The last [of theQur'an] that was revealed was the passage [lit., \"theverse\"] on riba; and, behold, the Apostle of God passedaway without [lit., \"before\"] having explained itsmeaning to us\" (Ibn Hanbal, on the authority of Sa'id ibnal-Musayyab). Nevertheless, the severity with which theQur'an condemns riba and those who practice it furnishes- especially when viewed against the background ofmankind's economic experiences during the interveningcenturies - a sufficiently clear indication of its natureand its social as well as moral implications. Roughlyspeaking, the opprobrium of riba (in the sense in whichthis term is used in the Qur'an and in many sayings ofthe Prophet) attaches to profits obtained throughinterest-bearing loans involving an exploitation of theeconomically weak by the strong and resourceful: anexploitation characterized by the fact that the lender,while retaining full ownership of the capital loaned andhaving no legal concern with the purpose for which it isto be used or with the manner of its use, remainscontractually assured of gain irrespective of any losseswhich the borrower may suffer in conseqence of thistransaction. With this definition in mind, we realizethat the question as to what kinds of financialtransactions fall within the category of riba is, in thelast resort, a moral one, closely connected with thesocio-economic motivation underlying the mutualrelationship of borrower and lender; and, stated inpurely economic terms, it is a question as to how profitsand risks may be equitably shared by both partners to aloan transaction. It is, of course, impossible to answerthis double question in a rigid, once-for-all manner: ouranswers must necessarily vary in accordance with thechanges to which man's social and technologicaldevelopment - and, thus, his economic environment - issubject. Hence, while the Qur'anic condemnation of theconcept and practice of riba is unequivocal and final,every successive Muslim generation is faced with thechallenge of giving new dimensions and a fresh economicmeaning to this term which, for want of a better word,may be rendered as \"usury\". - In the present instance(which, as I have mentioned, is the earliest in thehistory of the Qur'an), no clear-cut prohibition is asyet laid down; but the prohibition appearing in  2:275 ff. is already foreshadowed by the reference to theimmoral hope of increasing one's own substance \"through[other] people's"

The Prophet himself is reported to have said:\"None of you has real faith unless I am dearer unto himthan his father, and his child, and all mankind\" (Bukhariand Muslim, on the authority of Anas, with several almostidentical versions in other compilations). The Companionsinvariably regarded the Prophet as the spiritual fatherof his community. Some of them - e.g., Ibn Mas'ud (asquoted by Zamakhshari) or Ubayy ibn Ka'b, Ibn ''Abbas andMu'awiyah (as quoted by Ibn Kathir) - hardly ever recitedthe above verse without adding, by way of explanation,\"seeing that he is [as] a father to them\"; and many ofthe tabi'in - including Mujahid, Qatadah, 'Ikrimah andAl-Hasan (cf. Tabari and Ibn Kathir) - did the same:hence my interpolation, between brackets, of this phrase.(However, see also verse {40} of this surah and thecorresponding note [50].) As regards the status of theProphet's wives as the \"mothers of the believers\", thisarises primarily from the fact of their having shared thelife of God's Apostle in its most intimate aspect.Consequently, they could not remarry after his death (seeverse {53} below), since all the believers were,spiritually, their \"children\"."

At theinstigation of the Jewish tribe of Banu 'n-Nadir, who hadbeen expelled from Yathrib (Medina) after they had brokenthe treaty binding them to the Muslims, several of themost powerful Abrabian tribes formed a confederacy with aview to overcoming, once and for all, the threat posed byIslam to the beliefs and many of the customs of paganArabia. In the month of Shawwal, 5 H., a force of wellover 12,000 men, composed of the Quraysh and their allies- the Banu Kinanah, Banu Asad and the people of thecoastlands (the Tihamah), as well as the great Najditribe of Ghatafan and its allies, the Hawazin (or Banu'Amir) and Banu Sulaym - converged upon Medina.Forewarned of their coming, the Prophet had ordered adeep trench to be dug around the town - a defensivemeasure unknown in pre-Islamic Arabia - and thus broughtthe assault of the Confederates to a halt. At that point,however, another danger arose for the Muslims: the Jewishtribe of Banu Qurayzah, who lived in the outskirts ofMedina and until then had been allied with the Muslims,broke the treaty of alliance and openly joined theConfederates. Nevertheless, during a siege lastingseveral weeks all the attempts of the latter to cross thetrench - manned by the numerically much weaker and lesswell-armed Muslims - were repulsed with heavy losses tothe attackers; dissensions, based on mutual distrust,gradually undermined the much-vaunted alliance betweenthe Jewish and the pagan Arab tribes; in the month of Dhu'l-Qa'dah their frustration became complete when abitterly-cold stormwind raged for several days, makinglife unbearable even for hardened warriors. And so,finally, the siege was raised and the Confederatesdispersed, thus ending the last attempt of the pagans todestroy the Prophet and his community."

As soonas he became the boy's owner, Muhammad freed him, andshortly afterwards adopted him as his son; and Zayd, inhis turn, was among the first to embrace Islam. Yearslater, impelled by the desire to break down the ancientArabian prejudice against a slave's or even a freedman'smarrying a \"free-born\" woman, the Prophet persuaded Zaydto marry his (Muhammad's) own cousin, Zaynab bint Jahsh,who, without his being aware of it, had been in love withMuhammad ever since her childhood. Hence, she consentedto the proposed marriage with great reluctance, and onlyin deference to the authority of the Prophet. Since Zayd,too, was not at all keen on this alliance (being alreadyhappily married to another freed slave, Umm Ayman, themother of his son Usamah), it was not surprising that themarriage did not bring happiness to either Zaynab orZayd. On several occasions the latter was about todivorce his new wife who, on her part, did not make anysecret of her dislike of Zayd; and each time they werepersuaded by the Prophet to persevere in patience and notto separate. In the end, however, the marriage proveduntenable, and Zayd divorced Zaynab in the year 5 H.Shortly afterwards the Prophet married her in order toredeem what he considered to be his moral responsibilityfor her past unhappiness."

In thevicinity of its capital Ma'rib - sometimes also spelledMa'rib - the Sabaeans had built in the course ofcenturies an extraordinary system of dams, dykes andsluices, which became famous in history, with astonishingremnants extant to this day.

According toZamakhshari, it would seem that the syllable sln is anabbreviation of unaysin, the diminutive form of insanused by the Tayy' in exclamations. (It is to be borne inmind that in classical Arabic a diminutive is oftenexpressive of no more than endearment: e.g., ya bunayya,which does not necessarily signify \"O my little son\" but,rather, \"my dear son\" irrespective of the son's age.) Onthe whole, we may safely assume that the words ya sinapostrophize the Prophet Muhammad, who is explicitlyaddressed in the sequence, and are meant to stress - asthe Qur'an so often does - the fact of his and all otherapostles' humanness."

In the form in which it has beenhanded down from the earliest authorities (including,according to Tabari and Baghawi, Companions like 'AbdAllah ibn'Abbas and Anas ibn Malik, as well as several ofthe most prominent of their immediate successors), thestory contradicts the doctrine - somewhat arbitrarilydeveloped by Muslim theologians in the course of thecenturies - that prophets cannot sin by virtue of theirvery nature, and tends to show that their purity andsubsequent sinlessness is a result of inner struggles andtrials and, thus, represents in each case a moralachievement rather than an inborn quality. As narrated insome detail by Tabari and other early commentators, Davidfell in love with a beautiful woman whom he accidentallyobserved from his roof terrace. On inquiring, he was toldthat she was the wife of one of his officers, namedUriah. Impelled by his passion, David ordered hisfield-commander to place Uriah in a particularly exposedbattle position, where he would be certain to be killed;and as soon as his order was fulfilled and Uriah died,David married the widow (who subsequently became themother of Solomon). This story agrees more or less withthe Old Testament, which gives the woman's name asBath-Sheba (II Samuel xi), barring the Biblicalallegation that David committed adultery with her beforeUriah's death (ibid. xi, 4-5) - an allegation which hasalways been rejected by Muslims as highly offensive andslanderous: cf. the saying of the fourth Caliph, 'Ali ibnAbi Talib (quoted by Zamakhshari on the authority ofSa'id ibn al-Musayyab): \"If anyone should narrate thestory of David in the manner in which the story-tellersnarrate it, I will have him flogged with one hundred andsixty stripes - for this is a [suitable] punishment forslandering prophets\" (thus indirectly recalling theQur'anic ordinance, in  24:4 , which stipulates floggingwith eighty stripes for accusing ordinary persons ofadultery without legal proof). According to most of thecommentators, the two \"litigants\" who suddenly appearedbefore David were angels sent to bring home to him hissin. It is possible, however, to see in their appearancean allegory of David's own realization of having sinned:voices of his own conscience which at last \"surmountedthe walls\" of the passion that had blinded him for atime."

As to the operative verb yatawaffa, itprimarily denotes \"He takes [something] away in full\";and because death is characterized by a disappearance ofall vital impulses (the \"soul\") from the once-living body- their being \"taken away in full\", as it were - thisform of the verb has been used tropically, since timeimmemorial, in the sense of \"causing to die\", and (in itsintransitive form) \"dying\" or (as a noun) \"death\": ausage invariably adhered to in the Qur'an. Thetraditional likening of sleep to death is due to the factthat in both cases the body appears to be devoid ofconsciousness, partially and temporarily in the formercase, and completely and permanently in the latter. (Thepopular translation of anfus-pl. of nafs - as \"souls\" iscertainly inappropriate in the above context, since,according to the fundamental teaching of the Qur'an,man's soul does not \"die\" at the time of his bodily deathbut, on the contrary, lives on indefinitely.

But whereas it cannot be denied that the presentverse refers also to angels, it does not follow that itrefers exclusively to them. In its abstract connotation,the verb hamala frequently signifies \"he bore [or \"tookupon himself\"] the responsibility [for something]\": andso it is evident that it applies here not only to angelsbut also to all human beings who are conscious of thetremendous implications of the concept of God'salmightiness, and hence feel morally responsible fortranslating this consciousness into the reality of theirown and their fellow-beings' lives."

The characterization as \"yellow and budding\" -i.e., tender and of light colour - indicates thefreshness of new life in the pardoned sinner.

The classical commentators adopt, as a rule, thefirst sense and, consequently, interpret the passagethus: \"...the two angels that are charged with recordingman's doings do record them, sitting on his right and onhis left\". In my opinion, however, the second of the twopossible meanings (\"the two that aim at meeting eachother\") corresponds better with the preceding verse,which speaks of what man's innermost self (nafs)\"whispers within him\", i.e., voices his subconsciousdesires. Thus, \"the two that aim at meeting\" are, Ibelieve, the two demands of, or, more properly, the twofundamental motive forces within man's nature: hisprimal, instinctive urges and desires, both sensual andnon-sensual (all of them comprised in the modernpsychological term \"libido\"), on the one side, and hisreason, both intuitive and reflective, on the other. The\"sitting (qa'id) on the right and on the left\" is, to mymind, a metaphor for the conflicting nature of these dualforces which strive for predominance within every humanbeing: hence, my rendering of qa'id as \"contending\". Thisinterpretation is, moreover, strongly supported by thereference, in verse {21}, to man's appearing on JudgmentDay with \"that which drives and that which bears witness\"- a phrase which undoubtedly alludes to man's instinctiveurges as well as his conscious reason (see note [14]below)."

As described in a number ofreports going back to some Companions, the moon appearedone night as if split into two distinct parts. Whilethere is no reason to doubt the subjective veracity ofthese reports, it is possible that what actually happenedwas an unusual kind of partial lunar eclipse, whichproduced an equally unusual optical illusion. Butwhatever the nature of that phenomenon, it is practicallycertain that the above Qur'an-verse does not refer to itbut, rather, to a future event: namely, to what willhappen when the Last Hour approaches. (The Qur'anfrequently employs the past tense to denote the future,and particularly so in passages which speak of the comingof the Last Hour and of Resurrection Day; this use of thepast tense is meant to stress the certainty of thehappening to which the verb relates.) Thus, Raghibregards it as fully justifiable to interpret the phraseinshaqqa 'l-qamar (\"the moon is split asunder\") asbearing on the cosmic cataclysm - the end of the world aswe know it - that will occur before the coming ofResurrection Day (see art. shaqq in the  Mufradat). Asmentioned by Zamakhshari, this interpretation has thesupport of some of the earlier commentators; and it is,to my mind, particularly convincing in view of thejuxtaposition, in the above Qur'an-verse, of the moon's\"splitting asunder\" and the approach of the Last Hour.(In this connection we must bear in mind the fact thatnone of the Qur'anic allusions to the \"nearness\" of theLast Hour and the Day of Resurrection is based on thehuman concept of \"time\".)"

However, the deliberatelyunspecified reference to \"her who pleads concerning herhusband\" seems to point to all cases where a wife hasreason to complain against her husband: that is to say,not merely to an appeal against an unjustified or crueldivorce, but also to a wife's demand for release from anunbearable marriage.

TheQuraysh took this stipulation to include also marriedwomen, whom they considered to be under the\"guardianship\" of their husbands. Accordingly, whenseveral Meccan women embraced Islam against the will oftheir husbands and fled to Medina, the Quraysh demandedtheir forcible return to Mecca. This the Prophet refusedon the grounds that married women did not fall within thecategory of \"persons under guardianship\". However, sincethere was always the possibility that some of these womenhad gone over to the Muslims not for reasons of faith butout of purely worldly considerations, the believers wereenjoined to make sure of their sincerity; and so, theProphet asked each of them: \"Swear before God that thoudidst not leave because of hatred of thy husband, or outof a desire to go to another country, or in the hope ofattaining to worldly advantages: swear before God thatthou didst not leave for any reason save the love of Godand His Apostle\" (Tabari). Since God alone knows what isin the heart of a human being, a positive response of thewoman concerned was to be regarded as the only humanlyattainable - and, therefore, legally sufficient - proofof her sincerity. The fact that God alone is really awareof what is in a human being's heart is incorporated inthe shar'i principle that any adult person's declarationof faith, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary,makes it mandatory upon the community to accept thatperson - whether man or woman - as a Muslim on the basisof this declaration alone."

(It isto be borne in mind that Aramaic was the language used inPalestine at the time of, and for some centuries after,Jesus, and was thus undoubtedly the language in which theoriginal - now lost - texts of the Gospels werecomposed.) In view of the phonetic closeness ofPeriklytos and Parakletos it is easy to understand howthe translator - or, more probably, a later scribe -confused these two expressions. It is significant thatboth the Aramaic Mawhamana and the Greek Periklytos havethe same meaning as the two names of the Last Prophet,Muhammad and Ahmad, both of which are derived from theverb hamida (\"he praised\") and the noun hamd (\"praise\").An even more unequivocal prediction of the advent of theProphet Muhammad - mentioned by name, in its Arabic form- is said to be forthcoming from the so-called Gospel ofSt. Barnabas, which, though now regarded as apocryphal,was accepted as authentic and was read in the churchesuntil the year 496 of the Christian era, when it wasbanned as \"heretical\" by a decree of Pope Gelasius.However, since the original text of that Gospel is notavailable (having come down to us only in an Italiantranslation dating from the late sixteenth century), itsauthenticity cannot be established with certainty."

The fact that the earliest followersof Jesus regarded him as purely human is evident from themany theological controversies which persisted during thefirst three or four centuries of the Christian era. Thus,some renowned theologians, like Theodotus of Byzantium,who lived towards the end of the second century, and hisfollowers - among them Paul of Samosata, Bishop ofAntioch in the year 260 - maintained that the \"sonship ofGod\" mentioned in the then-existing texts of the Gospelswas purely symbolic, denoting no more than that Jesus wasa human being exalted by God.

This meaning is easilygrasped when we bear in mind that the root verb of theparticipial noun kafir (and of the infinitive noun kufr)is kafara, \"he [or \"it\"] covered [a thing]\": thus, in 57:20  the tiller of the soil is called (without anypejorative implication) kafir, \"one who covers\", i.e.,the sown seed with earth, just as the night is spoken ofas having \"covered\" (kafara) the earth with darkness. Intheir abstract sense, both the verb and the nouns derivedfrom it have a connotation of \"concealing\" something thatexists or \"denying\" something that is true. Hence, in theusage of the Qur'an - with the exception of the oneinstance (in  57:20 ) where this participial nounsignifies a \"tiller of the soil\" - a kafir is \"one whodenies [or \"refuses to acknowledge\"] the truth\" in thewidest, spiritual sense of this latter term: that is,irrespective of whether it relates to a cognition of thesupreme truth - namely, the existence of God - or to adoctrine or ordinance enunciated in the divine writ, orto a self-evident moral proposition, or to anacknowledgment of, and therefore gratitude for, favoursreceived.

According to Razi,the philosophers (arbab al-hikmah) identify these powersor faculties with, firstly, the seven organic functionsof the animal - and therefore also human-body(gravitation, cohesion, repulsion of noxious foreignmatter, absorption of beneficent external matter,assimilation of nutrients, growth, and reproduction);secondly, the five \"external\" or physical senses (sight,hearing, touch, smell and taste); thirdly, the five\"internal\" or intellectual senses, defined by Ibn Sina -on whom Razi apparently relies - as (1)perception ofisolated sence-images, (2)conscious apperceptions ofideas, (3)memory of sense-images, (4)memory of consciousapperceptions; and, lastly, the emotions of desire oraversion (resp. fear or anger), which have their roots inboth the \"external\" and \"internal\" sense-categories -thus bringing the total of the powers and faculties whichpreside over man's spiritual fate to nineteen. In theiraggregate, it is these powers that confer upon man theability to think conceptually, and place him, in thisrespect, even above the angels (cf.  2:30  ff. and thecorresponding notes; see also the following note)."

On the other hand, since aneglect or a deliberately wrong use of these angelicpowers is at the root of all sinning on the part of manand, therefore, of his suffering in the hereafter, theyare spoken of as \"the lords (ashab) of the fire [ofhell]\", which complements the expression \"over it\" in thepreceding verse."

As regards my rendering of kawa'ib as \"splendidcompanions\", it is to be remembered that the term ka'b -from which the participle ka'ib is derived - has manymeanings, and that one of these meanings is \"prominence\",\"eminence\" or \"glory\" (Lisan al-'Arab); thus, the verbka'ba, when applied to a person, signifies \"he made[another person] prominent\", \"glorious\" or \"splendid\"(ibid.) Based on this tropical meaning of both the verbka'ba and the noun ka'b, the participle ka'ib has oftenbeen used, in popular parlance, to denote \"a girl whosebreasts are becoming prominent\" or \"are budding\": hence,many commentators see in it an allusion to some sort ofyouthful \"female companions\" who would entertain the(presumably male) inmates of paradise. But quite apartfrom the fact that all Qur'anic allegories of the joys ofparadise invariably apply to men and women alike, thisinterpretation of kawa'ib overlooks the purely derivativeorigin of the above popular usage - which is based on thetropical connotation of \"prominence\" inherent in the nounka'b - and substitutes for this obvious tropism theliteral meaning of something that is physicallyprominent: and this, in my opinion, is utterlyunjustified. If we bear in mind that the Qur'anicdescriptions of the blessings of paradise are alwaysallegorical, we realize that in the above context theterm kawa'ib can have no other meaning than \"glorious [or\"splendid\"] beings\", without any definition of sex; andthat, in combination with the term atrab, it denotes,\"splendid companions well-matched\" - thus alluding to therelations of the blest with one another, and stressingthe absolute mutual compatibility and equal dignity ofall of them.

The most popularinterpretation is based on the view that the descriptiveparticiples an-nazi'at, an-nashitat, as-sabihat,as-sabiqat and al-mudabbirat refer to angels and theiractivities with regard to the souls of the dying: aninterpretation categorically rejected by Abu Muslimal-Isfahani, who - as mentioned by Razi - points out thatthe angels are never referred to in the Qur'an in thefemale gender, as is the case in the above fiveparticiples, and that the present passage cannot be anexception. Almost equally unconvincing - because somewhatlaboured - are the explanations which link those fiveparticiples to the souls of the dying, or to warriorsengaged in holy war, or to war-mounts, and so forth. Theclearest and simplest interpretation is that advanced byQatadah (as quoted by Tabari and Baghawi) and Al-Hasanal-Basri (quoted by Baghawi and Razi), who maintain thatwhat is meant in this passage are the stars - includingthe sun and the moon - and their movements in space: andthis interpretation is fully in tune with many otherpassages in the Qur'an in which the harmony of thosecelestial bodies in their multiform orbits and gradedspeeds is cited as an evidence of God's planning andcreativeness. In accordance with this interpretation, theparticiple an-nazi'at occurring in the first versedenotes the daily \"ascending\" or \"rising\" of the stars,while their subsequent \"setting\" is indicated by theexpression gharqan, which comprises the two concepts of\"drowning,\" (i.e., disappearing) and, tropically, of the\"completeness\" of this daily phenomenon (Zamakhshari)."

Now if we analyzethe origin of this noun, we find that it is derived fromthe verb taraqa, which primarily means \"he beat[something]\" or \"knocked [at something]\"; hence, taraqa'l-bab, \"he knocked at the door\". Tropically, the nounsignifies \"anything [or \"anyone\"] that comes in thenight\", because a person who comes to a house by night isexpected to knock at the door (Taj al-'Arus). In theQur'anic mode of expression, at-tariq is evidently ametaphor for the heavenly solace which sometimes comes toa human being lost in the deepest darkness of afflictionand distress; or for the sudden, intuitive enlightenmentwhich disperses the darkness of uncertainty; or, finally,for divine revelation, which knocks, as it were, at thedoors of man's heart, and thus fulfils the functions ofboth solace and enlightenment.

This lastclause has ever since given much trouble to thecommentators, inasmuch as it is not very plausible thatHe who has revealed the Qur'an to the Prophet shouldcause him to forget anything of it. Hence, manyunconvincing explanations have been advanced from veryearly times down to our own days, the least convincingbeing that last refuge of every perplexedQuran-commentator, the \"doctrine of abrogation\" (refutedin my note [87] on  2:106 ). However, the supposeddifficulty of interpretation disappears as soon as weallow ourselves to realize that the above passage, thoughostensibly addressed to the Prophet, is directed at manin general, and that it is closely related to an earlierQuranic revelation - namely, the first five verses ofsurah {96} (\"The Germ-Cell\") and, in particular, verses{3-5}, which speak of God's having \"taught man what hedid not know\". In note [3] on those verses I haveexpressed the opinion that they allude to mankind'scumulative acquisition of empirical and rationalknowledge, handed down from generation to generation andfrom one civilization to another: and it is to this veryphenomenon that the present passage, too, refers. We aretold here that God, who has formed man in accordance withwhat he is meant to be and has promised to guide him,will enable him to acquire (and thus, as it were,\"impart\" to him) elements of knowledge which mankind willaccumulate, record and collectively \"remember\" - exceptwhat God may cause man to \"forget\" (in another word, toabandon) as having become redundant by virtue of his newexperiences and his acquisition of wider, moredifferentiated elements of knowledge, empirical as wellas deductive or speculative, including more advanced,empirically acquired skills. However, the very nextsentence makes it clear that all knowledge arrived atthrough our observation of the external world and throughspeculation, though necessary and most valuable, isdefinitely limited in scope and does not, therefore, initself suffice to give us an insight into ultimatetruths."

But precisely because a reference to\"camels\" would restrict its significance to people of aparticular environment and a particular time (withouteven the benefit of a historical allusion to pastevents), it must be ruled out here, for the Qur'anicappeals to observe the wonders of the God-createduniverse are invariably directed at people of all timesand all environments.

It is generally assumed that thisparticiple, in combination with the phrase lam yakun atthe beginning of the verse, denotes \"they did not [or\"could not\"] give up\" or \"separate themselves from\" -i.e., supposedly, from their erroneous beliefs - \"untilthere came to them the evidence of the truth\" in theperson of the Prophet Muhammad and in the revelation ofthe Qur'an: implying that after the evidence came, theydid give up those false beliefs. This assumption is,however, deficient on two counts: firstly, it iswell-known that not all of the erring ones from among theahl al-kitab and the mushrikin accepted the message ofthe Qur'an when it was conveyed to them; and, secondly,the ahl al-kitab are spoken of in verse {4} as having\"broken their unity [of faith]\" - i.e., offended againstthe fundamental principles of that faith - after \"theevidence of the truth\" had come to them. This apparentcontradiction has been convincingly resolved by no lessan authority than Ibn Taymiyyah (see Tafsir Sitt Suwar,pp. 391 ff.); and it is his interpretation that I havefollowed in my rendering of the above three verses.According to Ibn Taymiyyah, the pivotal phrase lam yakunmunfakkin does not denote \"they did not give up\" or\"separate themselves from\", but, rather, \"they are notabandoned\" - i.e., condemned by God - unless and untilthey have been shown the right way by a God-sent prophet,and thereupon have consciously refused to follow it: andthis is in accord with repeated statements in the Qur'anto the effect that God does not take anyone to task forwrong beliefs and wrong actions unless the true meaningof right and wrong has previously been made clear to him(cf. {6:131-132} and the second paragraph of  17:15 , aswell as the corresponding notes). Hence, the abovereference to \"the evidence of the truth\" does not relateonly to the Qur'an and the Prophet Muhammad but to allthe earlier prophets and revelations as well (cf.  42:13 and the corresponding notes [12-14]- just as the\"ordinances of ever-true soundness and clarity\" (spelledout in verse {5} below) are common to all God-inspiredmessages, of which the Qur'an is the final, most perfectexpression."

But whereas the conventionalexplanation is based on the assumption that \"thechargers\" symbolize here the believers' fight in God'scause (jihad) and, therefore, represent something highlycommendable, it takes no account whatever of thediscrepancy between so positive an imagery and thecondemnation expressed in verses {6} ff., not to speak ofthe fact that such a conventional interpretation does notprovide any logical link between the two parts of thesurah. But since such a link must exist, and since verses{6-11} are undoubtedly condemnatory, we must concludethat the first five verses, too, have the same - or, atleast, a similar - character. This character becomes atonce obvious if we dissociate ourselves from thepreconceived notion that the imagery of \"the chargers\" isused here in a laudatory sense. In fact, the opposite isthe case. Beyond any doubt, \"the chargers\" symbolize theerring human soul or self - a soul devoid of allspiritual direction, obsessed and ridden by all manner ofwrong, selfish desires, madly, unseeingly rushingonwards, unchecked by conscience or reason, blinded bythe dust-clouds of confused and confusing appetites,storming into insoluble situations and, thus, into itsown spiritual destruction."

As already mentioned in theintroductory note, the particular chastisement to whichthe above verse alludes seems to have been a suddenepidemic of extreme virulence: according to Waqidi andMuhammad ibn Ishaq - the latter as quoted by Ibn Hishamand Ibn Kathir - \"this was the first time that spottedfever (hasbah) and smallpox (judari) appeared in the landof the Arabs\". It is interesting to note that the wordhasbah - which, according to some authorities, signifiesalso typhus - primarily means \"pelting [or smiting\"] withstones\" (Qamus). - As regards the noun ta'ir (of whichtayr is the plural), we ought to remember that it denotesany \"flying creature\", whether bird or insect (Tajal-'Arus). Neither the Qur'an nor any authentic Traditionoffers us any evidence as to the nature of the \"flyingcreatures\" mentioned in the above verse; and since, onthe other hand, all the \"descriptions\" indulged in by thecommentators are purely imaginary, they need not beseriously considered. If the hypothesis of an epidemic iscorrect, the \"flying creatures\" - whether birds orinsects - may well have been the carriers of theinfection. One thing, however, is clear: whatever thenature of the doom that overtook the invading force, itwas certainly miraculous in the true sense of this word -namely, in the sudden, totally unexpected rescue which itbrought to the distressed people of Mecca."
