    "Body": "Cf. note [2] on  89:3 , as well as surah {19}, note [77].\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe fact that God is one and unique in every respect,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout beginning and without end, has its logical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorrelate in the statement that \"there is nothing that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould be compared with Him - thus precluding any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossibility of describing or defining Him (see note [88]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the last sentence of  6:100 ). Consequently, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquality of His Being is beyond the range of human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomprehension or imagination: which also explains why any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattempt at \"depicting\" God by means of figurative\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepresentations or even abstract symbols must be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqualified as a blasphemous denial of the truth."
