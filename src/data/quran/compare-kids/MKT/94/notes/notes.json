    "Text": "  &nbsp;The Prophet&rsquo;s name is always mentioned in the call to prayer, along with Allah&rsquo;s Name. Close to the end of each of the five daily prayers, worshippers invoke Allah&rsquo;s blessings upon the Prophet (&#65018;) and his family. When someone reverts to Islam, they testify that Allah is their Lord and Mu&#7717;ammad is His Messenger. Muslims, even those who are not practicing, love the Prophet (&#65018;) and many name their children after him.   "

    "Text": "  &nbsp;If a definite noun is repeated in Arabic, it means that we are referring to the same thing. For example, &ldquo;I met the man and I gave the man some money.&rdquo; But if an indefinite noun is repeated, it means we are referring to two different things. For example, &ldquo;I met a man and I gave a man some money.&rdquo; With this in mind, we realize that 94:5-6 refers to one hardship (a definite noun) and two different eases (an indefinite noun). Hence, the Arabic saying: &ldquo;Two eases cannot be overcome by one hardship.&rdquo;  "
