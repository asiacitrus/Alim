In an authentic narration collected by At-Tirmi&#11372;i, the Prophet (&#65018;) reports that Almighty Allah says, \"O children of Adam! As long as you call upon Me, putting your hope in Me, I will forgive you for what you have done, and I will not mind. O &nbsp;children of Adam! If your sins were to reach the clouds of the sky and then you sought My forgiveness, I would &#761;still&#762; forgive you. O &nbsp;children of Adam! If you were to come to Me with sins filling the whole world and then you came to Me without associating other gods with Me, I would certainly match your sins with forgiveness.\"   "
