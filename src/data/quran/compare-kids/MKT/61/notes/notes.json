Both are derived from &#7717;a-ma-da&nbsp;which means &lsquo;praise.&rsquo; Some Muslim scholars believe this verse refers to John 14:16, where Jesus says: &ldquo;And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another periklytos, to be with you forever.&rdquo; Periklytos is a Greek word that means &lsquo;the praised one.&rsquo; The name of Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad (&#65018;) appears several times in the Gospel of Barnabas, which is deemed apocryphal by Christian authorities.
