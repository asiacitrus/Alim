The moon was split, and then re-joined, as reported by several eyewitnesses, but still the pagans refused to believe, calling this miracle &ldquo;sheer magic.&rdquo;  "

    "Text": "  &nbsp;A miracle (usually referred to as a &lsquo;sign&rsquo; in the Quran) can be defined as an extraordinary event manifesting divine intervention in human affairs. Every prophet was given miracles to prove he was commissioned by Allah. Moses (&#65018;) was given the miracle of the staff and many others. Jesus (&#65018;) gave life to the dead and healed the blind and the leper. And Mu&#7717;ammad (&#65018;) received the Quran, a literary miracle, to challenge the masters of Arabic eloquence. The Prophet (&#65018;) performed some other miracles such as splitting the moon, multiplying food and water, and healing some of his companions.  "
