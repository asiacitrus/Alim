The polytheists, who were present, laughed in agreement with this argument. The Prophet (&#65018;) replied that the verse was talking exclusively about idols, adding that Jesus himself did not ask anyone to worship him. Verse 21:101 was later revealed in support of the Prophet&rsquo;s argument. Eventually, &rsquo;Abdull&acirc;h accepted Islam.  "
