                "text": "The Arabic words \"Rahman\" and \"Rahim\" translated \"MostGracious\" and \"Most Merciful\" are both intensive formsreferring to different aspects of God's attribute ofMercy.The Arabic intensive is more suited to expressGod's attributes than the superlative degree in English. The latter implies a comparison with other beings, orwith other times or places, while there is no being likeunto God, and He is independent of Time and Place.  Mercymay imply pity, long-suffering, patience, andforgiveness, all of which the sinner needs and God MostMerciful bestows in abundant measure.  But there is aMercy that goes before even the need arises, the Gracewhich is ever watchful, and flows from God Most Graciousto all His creatures, protecting the, preserving them,guiding them, and leading them to clearer light andhigher life.  For this reason the attribute Rahman (MostGracious) is not applied to any but God, but theattribute Rahim (Merciful), is a general term, and mayalso be applied to Men.  To make us contemplate theseboundless gifts of God, the formula:  \"In the name of GodMost Gracious, Most Merciful\": is placed before everySura of the Qur-an (except the ninth), and repeated atthe beginning of every act by the Muslim who dedicateshis life to God, and whose hope is in His Mercy."

The power ofwill or choosing would have to go with them, in orderthat man might steer his own bark.  This power of will(when used aright) gave him to some extent a mastery overhis own fortunes and over nature, thus bringing himnearer to the God-like nature which has supreme masteryand will. We may suppose the angels had no independentwills of their own; their perfection in other waysreflected God's perfection but could not raise them tothe dignity of vicegerency.  The perfect vicegerent is hewho has the power of initiative himself, but whoseindependent action always reflects perfectly the will ofhis Principal.The distinction is expressed byShakespeare (Sonnet 94) in those fine lines: \"They arethe lords and owners of their faces.  Others but stewardsof their excellence.\"  The angels in their one-sidednesssaw only the mischief consequent on the misuse of theemotional nature by man; perhaps they also, being withoutemotions, did not understand the whole of God's nature,which gives and asks for love.In humility and truedevotion to God, they remonstrate; we must not imaginethe least tinge of jealousy, as they are without emotion. This mystery of love being above them, they are toldthat they do not know and they acknowledge (in ii. 32below) not their fault (for there is no question offault) but their imperfection of knowledge.

Israel had twelve sons(Gen. xxxv. 22-26), including Levi and Joseph.Thedescendants of these twelve sons were the \"Children ofIsrael.\"  Levi's family got the priesthood and the careof the Tabernacle; they were exempted from militaryduties for which the census was taken (Nu. i. 47-53), andtherefore from the distribution of Land in Canaan (Josh.xiv. 3); they were distributed among all the Tribes, andwere really a privileged caste and not numbered among theTribes; Moses and Aaron belonged to the house of Levi. On the other hand Joseph, on account of the high positionto which he rose in Egypt as the Pharoah's minister, wasthe progenitor of two tribes, one in the name of each ofhis two sons Ephraim and Manasseh.

The parable of the deadman we shall refer to later. The lesson of the heiferparable is plain. Moses announced the sacrifice the theIsraelites, and they treated it as a jest. When Mosescontinued solemnly to ask fo the sacrifice, they put himoff on one pretext and another, asking a number ofquestions which they could have answered themeselves ifthey had listened to Moses's directions. Their questionswere carping criticisms rather than the result of adesire for information. It was a mere thin pretence thatthey were genuinely seeking for guidance. When at lastthey were driven into a corner, they made the sacrifice,but the will was wanting, which would have made thesacrifice efficacious for purification from sin. The realreason for their prevarications was their guiltyconscience, as we see in the parable of the dead man (ii.72-73)."

The Jewish story based on this was that in acertain case of this kind, every one tried to clearhimself of guilt and lay the blame at the door of others.In the first place they tried to prevaricate and preventa heifer being slain as in the last parable. When she wasslain, Allah by a miracle disclosed the really guiltyperson. A portion of the sacrificed heifer was ordered tobe placed on the corpse, which came to life and disclosedthe whole story of the crime.  The lesson of this parableis that men may try to hide their crimes individually orcollectively, but Allah will bring them to light inunexpected ways.

When the Muslimcommunity began to grow stronger they pretended to be ofthem, but really tried to keep back any knowledge oftheir own Scriptures from them, lest they should bebeaten by their own arguments. The more generalinterpretation holds good in all ages. Faith and Unfaithare pitted against each other. Faith has to struggleagainst power, position, organization, and privilege.When it gains ground, Unfaith comes forward insincerelyand claims fellowship. But in its own mind it is jealousof the armoury of sience and knowledge which Faith bringsinto the service of Allah.  But Allah knows all, and ifthe people of Faith will only seek knowledge sincerelywherefver they can find it,-even as far afield as China,as Muhammad said, they can defeat Unfaith on its ownground. [Even though the directive that Muslims shouldderive knowledge regardless of its location is anacceptable proposition from the Islamic viewpoint, thetradition to which the author refers here is notauthentic]."

Manyof them, even if they could read, were no better thanilliterates, for they knew not their own true Scriptures,but read into them what they wanted, or at best their ownconjectures.  They palmed off their own writings for theMessage of God.  Perhaps it brought them profit for thetime being; but it was a miserable profit if they \"gainedthe whole world and lost their own souls\" (Matt. xvi.26).  \"Writing with their own hands\" means inventingbooks themselves, which had no divine authority. Thegeneral argument is similar. Unfaith erects its own falsegods. It attributes things to causes which only exist inits own imagination. Sometimes it even indulges in actualdishonest traffic in the ignorance of the multitude. Itmay pay for a time, but the bubble always bursts."

Lest anyone shouldthink that the heavens and the earth were themselvesprimeval and eternal, we are now told that theythemselves are creatures of God's will and design.  Cfvi. 102, where the word bada'a is used as here for thecreation of the heavens and the earth, and khalaqa isused for the creation of all things.  Bada'a goes back tothe very primal beginning, as far as we can conceive it. The materialists might say that primeval matter waseternal; other things, i.e., the forms and shapes as wesee them now, were called into being at some time orother, and will perish.  When they perish, they dissolveinto primeval matter again, which stands as the base ofall existence. We go further back.  We say that if wepostulate such primeval matter, it owes its origin itselfto GodWho is the final basis of existence, the Cause ofall Causes.  If this is conceded, we proceed to arguethat the process of Creation is not then completed.  \"Allthings in the heavens and on the earth\" are created bygradual processes.  In \"things\" we include abstract aswell as material things.  We see the abstract things andideas actually growing before us.  But that also is God'screation, to which we can apply the word khalaqa, for init is involved the idea of measuring, fitting it into ascheme of other things. Cf. liv. 49; also xxv. 59.  Herecomes in what we know as the process of evolution.  Onthe other hand, the \"amr\" (=Command, Direction, Design)is a single thing, unrelated to Time, \"like the twinklingof an eye\" (liv. 50). Another word to note in thisconnection is ja'ala \"making\" which seems to imply newshapes and forms, new dispositions, as the making of theSigns of the Zodiac in the heavens, or the setting out ofthe sun and moon for light, or the establishment of thesuccession of day and night (xxv 61-62).  A furtherprocess with regard to the soul is described in the wordsawwa, bringing it to perfection (xci. 7) but this weshall discuss in its place.  Fatara (xlii. 11) implies,like bada'a, the creating of a thing out of nothing andafter no preexisting similitude, but perhaps fataraimplies the creation of primeval matter to which furtherprocesses have to be applied later, as when one preparesdough but leaves the leavining to be done after.  Badaa(without the 'ain), xxx. 27, implies beginning theprocess of creation; this is made further clear in xxxii.7 where the beginning of the creation of pristine manfrom clay refers to his physical body, leaving thefurther processes of reproduction and the breathing in ofthe soul to be described in subsequent verses.Lastly,baraa is creation implying liberation from pre-existingmatter or circumstance, e.g, man's body from clay (lix.24) or a calamity from previously existing circumstances(lvii. 22).  See also vi. 94, n. 916; vi. 98, n. 923;lix. 24, nn. 5405-6."

Butthere was no universal Qibla among them.  Some Jewsturned towards Jerusalem, especially during theCaptivity, as we shall see later.  At the time of ourProphet, Jerusalem was in the hands of the ByzantineEmpire, which was Christian.  But the Christians orientedtheir churches to the East (hence the word \"orientation\")which is a point of the compass, and not the direction ofany sacred place.  The fact of the altar being in theEast does not mean that every worshipper has his face tothe east; for, according at least to modern practice, theseats in a church are so placed that differentworshippers may face in different directions.  ThePreacher of Unity naturally wanted, in this as in othermatters, a symbol of complete unity, and his heart wasnaturally delighted when the Qibla towards the Ka'ba wassettled.  Its connection with Abraham gave it greatantiquity; its character of being an Arab centre made itappropriate when the Message came in Arabic, and waspreached through the union of the Arabs; at the time itwas adopted, the little Muslim community was shut out ofit, being exiles in Medina, but it became a symbol ofhope and eventual triumph, of which Muhammad lived to seethe fulfilment; and it also became the centre andgathering ground of all peoples in the universalpilgrimage, which was instituted with it."

Again, there may be outsiders for whom he may wish toprovide, and jurists have held that he has powers ofdisposition up to one-third of his property.  But he mustnot be partial to one heir at the expense of another, orattempt to defeat lawful creditors.  If he tries to dothis, those who are witnesses to his oral disposition mayinterfere in two ways. One way would be to persuade thetestator to change his bequest before he dies. The otherway would be after death, to get the interested partiestogether and ask them to agree to a more equitablearrangement.  In such a case they are acting in goodfaith, and there is no fraud.  They are doing nothingwrong. Islam approves of every lawful device for keepingbrethren at peace, without litigation and quarrels.

All three incidents aresuch as may happen again and again in any prophet'slifetime, and be seen in impersonal vision at any time.

But themystery of Life baffled science then, as it continues tobaffle science now, after many centuries of progress. Abraham had faith and referred back everything to thetrue Cause of Causes.  A sceptical ruler might jestinglysay: \"I have the power of life and death\".  A man ofscience might say: \"We have investigated the laws of lifeand death.\"  Different kinds of powers lie in the handsof kings and men of knowledge.The claim in both casesis true in a very limited sense.  But Abraham confoundedthe claimer by going back to fundamentals.  \"If you hadthe ultimate power, why could you not make the sun risefrom the West?\""

In essence it amounts to aconsciousness of the Will and Plan of Allah and a joyfulsubmission to that Will and Plan. If any one wants areligion other than that, he is false to his own nature,as he is false to Allah's Will and Plan. Such a onecannot expect guidance, for he has deliberately renouncedguidance.

They numbered some 3,000 fighting men under AbuSufyan, and they were so confident of victory that theirwomen-folk came with them, and showed the most shamefulsavagery after the battle. To meet the threatened dangerthe Messenger of Allah, Muhammad Al-Mustafa, with hisusual foresight, courage, and initiative, resolved totake his station at the foot of Mount Uhud, whichdominates the city of Madinah some three miles to thenorth. Early in the morning, on the 7th of Shawwal, A.H.3 (January, 625), he made his dispositions for battle.Madinah winters are notoriously rigorous, but thewarriors of Islam (700 to 1000 in number) were up early.A torrent bed was to their south, and the passes in thehills at their back were filled with 50 archers toprevent the enemy attack from the rear. The enemy wereset the task of attacking the walls of Madinah, with theMuslims at their rear. In the beginning the battle wentwell for the Muslims. The enemy wavered, but the Muslimarchers, in disobedience of their orders, left theirposts to join in the pursuit and share in the booty.There was also treachery on the part of the 300\"Hypocrites\" led by Abdullah ibn Ubai, who deserted. Theenemy took advantage of the opening left by the archers,and there was severe hand-to-hand fighting, in whichnumbers told in favour of the enemy. Many of theCompanions and Helpers were killed. But there was norout. Among the Muslim martyrs was the gallant Hamza, abrother of the Prophet's father. The graves of themartyrs are still shown at Uhud. The Messenger himselfwas wounded in his head and face, and one of his frontteeth was broken. Had it not been for his firmness,courage, and coolness, all would have been lost. As itwas, the prophet, in spite of his wound, and many of thewounded Muslims, inspired by his example, returned to thefield next day, and Abu Sufyan and his Makkan armythought it most prudent to withdraw. Madinah was saved,but a lesson in faith, constancy, firmness, andsteadfastness was learnt by the Muslims."

Here it occurs, to encourage usto increase property by economic use (traffic and trade),recalling Christ's parable of the Talents (Matt. xxv.14-30), where the servants who had increased theirmaster's wealth were promoted and the servant who hadhoarded was cast into darkness. (3) We are warned thatour waste may mean our own destruction (\"nor kill ordestroy yourselves.\") But there is a more general meaningalso: we must be careful of our own and other people'slives. We must commit no violence. This is the oppositeof \"trade and traffic by mutual good-will.\" (4) Ourviolence to our own brethren is particularlypreposterous, seeing that Allah has loved and showeredHis mercies on us and all His creatures."

As to journeys, two questions arise:(1) what constitutes a journey for this purpose? (2) isthe fear of an attack an essential condition for theshortening of the prayers? As to (1), it is best to leavethe matter to discretion, having regard to all thecircumstances of the journey, as in the case of thejourneys which excuse a fast: see ii. 184, n. 190. Thetext leaves it to discretion. As to (2), the practice ofthe Prophet shows that danger is not an essentialcondition; it is merely mentioned as a possible incident.The Messenger usually shortened the prayers from fourRakats to two Rakats in Zuhr (midday prayer), 'Asr(afternoon prayer) and Ishaa (night prayer): the othertwo are in any case short, Fajr (morning prayer) havingtwo Rakats and Magrib (evening prayer) having three."

TheJew denied the charge and accused Taima, but thesympathies of the Muslim community were with Taima onaccount of his nominal profession of Islam. The case wasbrought to the Prophet, who acquitted the Jew accordingto the strict principle of justice, as \"guided by Allah.\"Attempts were made to prejudice him and deceive him intousing his authority to favour Taima. When Taima realizedthat his punishment was imminent he fled and turnedapostate. The general lesson is that the righteous man isfaced with all sorts of subtle wiles; the wicked will tryto appeal to his highest sympathies and most honourablemotives to deceive him and use him as an instrument fordefeating justice. He should be careful and cautious, andseek the help of Allah for protection against deceptionand for firmness in dealing the strictest justice withoutfear or favour. To do otherwise is to betray a sacredtrust; the trustee must defeat all attempts made tomislead him."

The Orthodox Christian Churches makeit a cardinal point of their doctrine that his life wastaken on the Cross, that he died and was buried, that onthe third day he rose in the body with his wounds intact,and walked about and conversed, and ate with hisdisciples, and was afterwards taken up bodily to heaven.This is necessary for the theological doctrine of bloodsacrifice and vicarious atonement for sins, which isrejected by Islam. But some of the early Christian sectsdid not believe that Christ was killed on the Cross. TheBasilidans believed that some one else was substitutedfor him. The Docetae held that Christ never had a realphysical or natural body, but only an apparent or phantombody, and that his Crucifixion was only apparent, notreal. The Marcionite Gospel (about A.D. 138) denied thatJesus was born, and merely said that he appeared in humanform. The Gospel of St. Barnabas supported the theory ofsubstitution on the Cross. The Quranic teaching is thatChrist was not crucified nor killed by the Jews,notwithstanding certain apparent circumstances whichproduced that illusion in the minds of some of hisenemies: that disputations, doubts, and conjectures onsuch matters are vain; and that he was taken up to Allah(see next verse and note)."

At both the placesit repudiates the false claims of the People of the Bookthat they had a special relationship with Allah for theywere the children of Abraham; that they were a chosenpeople with special privileges, and no matter what theydid, their high status would remain unaffected. Here thisfalse notion is refuted and the People of the Book arebeing reminded that it is through sincere belief andrighteous conduct rather than pretentious claims that mancan win his Lord's pleasure and achieve ultimate success.The verse does not purport to lay down an exhaustive listof the articles of faith. Nor does it seek to spell outthe essentials of a genuine belief in Allah, which has nomeaning unless it is accompanied by belief in HisProphets for it is through their agency alone that weknow Allah's Will and can abide by it in our practicallives. This is especially true of His final Prophet,Muhammad (peace be on him) whose message is universal,and not confined to any particular group or section ofhumanity. Belief in the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace beon him) is thus an integral part and a logical corollaryof belief in Allah. Moreover, it is also an essentialtest of genuineness of such belief.

It included both rocky country (hijr.xv. 80), and the spacious fertile valley (Wadi) andplains country of Qura, which begins just north of theCity of Madinah and is traversed by the Hijaz Railway.When the holy Prophet in the 9th year of the Hijra ledhis expedition to Tabuk (about 400 miles north ofMadinah) against the Roman forces, on a reported Romaninvasion from Syria, he and his men came across thearchaeological remains of the Thamud.

In 85 B.C. they werelords of Damascus under their king Haritha (Aretas ofRoman history). For some time they were allies of theRoman Empire and held the Red Sea littoral. The EmperorTrajan reduced them and annexed their territory in A.D.105. The Nabataeans succeeded the Thamud of Arabiantradition. The Thamud are mentioned by name in aninscription of the Assyrian King Sargon, dated 715 B.C.,as a people of Eastern and Central Arabia (Encyclopaediaof Islam). See also Appendix VII to S. xxvi.

They were a wanderingtribe: it was Midianite merchants to whom Joseph was soldinto slavery, and who took him to Egypt. Their principalterritory in the time of Moses was in the northeast ofthe Sinai Peninsula, and east of the Amalekites. UnderMoses the Israelites waged a war of extermination againstthem: they slew the kings of Midian, slaughtered all themales, burnt their cities and castles, and captured theircattle (Num. xxxi, 7-1 1). This sounds like totalextermination. Yet a few generations afterwards, theywere so powerful that the Israelites for their sins weredelivered into the captivity of the Midianites for sevenyears: both the Midianites and their camels were withoutnumber: and the Israelites hid from them in \"dens.....caves, and strongholds\" (Judges vii. 1- 6).

There is no similarity either in names or incidents,and there are chronological difficulties (see n. 1064below). If, as the Commentators tell us, Shuaib was inthe fourth generation from Abraham, being agreat-grandson of Madyan (a son of Abraham), he would beonly about a century from the time of Abraham, whereasthe Hebrew Bible would give us a period of four to sixcenturies between Abraham and Moses. The mere fact thatJathro was a Midianite and that another name, Hobab, ismentioned for a father-in-law of Moses in Num x. 29, isslender ground for identificaion. As the Midianites weremainly a nomad tribe, we need not be surprised that theirdestruction in one or two settlements did not affecttheir life in wandering sections of the tribe in othergeographical regions. Shu'aib's mission was apparently inone of the settled towns of the Midianites, which wascompletely destroyed by an earthquake (vii. 91). If thishappened in the century after Abraham, there is nodifficulty in supposing that they were again a numeroustribe, three or five centuries later, in the time ofMoses (see last note). As they were a mixed wanderingtribe, both their resilience and their eventualabsorption can be easily understood. But the destructionof the settlement or settlements (if the Wood or Aika wasa separate settlement, see n. 2000 to xv. 78) to whichShu'aib was sent to preach was complete, and no traces ofit now remain. The name of the highest mountain of Yemen,Nabi Shu'aib (11,000 ft.) has probably no connection withthe geographical territory of the nomad Midianites,unless we suppose that their wanderings extended so farsouth from the territories mentioned in the last note."

(2) What was the result in the case of those whofell into sin? Will you not take warning by theirexample? So Shu'aib began his argument with faith inAllah as the source of all virtue, and ended it withdestruction as the result of all sin.

Any other view of redemption is rejectedby Islam, especially that of corrupted Christianity,which thinks that some other person suffered for our sinsand we are redeemed by his blood. It is ourself-surrender that counts, not other people's merits.Our complete self-surrender may include fighting for thecause, both spiritual and physical. As regards actualfighting with the sword there has been some difference intheological theories at different times, but very littlein the practice of those who framed those theories. TheJewish wars were ruthless wars of extermination. The OldTestament does not mince matters on this subject. In theNew Testament St. Paul, in commending the worthy fruitsof Faith, mentions Gideon, Barak, and other warriors ofthe Old Testament as his ideals, \"Who through faithsubdued kingdoms... waxed valiant in fight, turned toflight the armies of the aliens...\" (Hebrews, xi. 32-34).The monkish morality of the Gospels in their present formhas never been followed by any self-respecting Christianor other nation in history. Nor is it common-sense toignore lust of blood in unregenerate man as a form ofevil which has to be combated \"within the limits, set byAllah\" (Q. ix. 112)."

(see E.B.,Kurdistan). That region comprises the modern Turkishdistrict of Bohtan, in which Jabal Judi is situated (nearthe frontiers of modern Turkey, modern 'lraq, and modernSyria), and the town of Jazirat ibn 'Umar, (on thepresent Turco-Syrian frontier), and it extends into 'Iraqand Persia.

This mountain system \"is uniquein the Old World in containing great sheets of water thatare bitter lakes without outlets, Lake Van and LakeUrumiya being the chief,\" (E.B., Asia). Such would be thevery region for a stupendous Deluge if the usual scantyrainfall were to be changed into a very heavy downpour. Aglacier damming of Lake Van in the Ice Age would haveproduced the same result. The region has many localtraditions connected with Noah and the Flood. TheBiblical legend of Mount Ararat being the resting placeof Noah's Ark is hardly plausible, seeing that thehighest peak of Ararat is over 16,000 feet high. If itmeans one of the lower-peaks of the Ararat system, itagrees with the Muslim tradition about Mount Judi (orGudi), and this is in accordance with the oldest and bestlocal traditions.

Abraham had by this time passed through thefire of persecutions in the Mesopotamian valleys: he hadleft behind him the ancestral idolatry of Ur of theChaldees; he had been tried and he had triumphed over thepersecution of Nimrud: he had now taken up his residencein Canaan, from which his newphew Lot (Lut) was called topreach to the wicked Cities of the Plain east of the Deadsea which is itself called Bahr Lut. Thus prepared andsanctified, he was now ready to receive the Message thathe was chosen to be the progenitor of a great line ofProphets, and that Message is now referred to. Can welocalise Nimrud? If local tradition in place-names can berelied upon, this king must have ruled over the tractwhich includes the modern Nimrud, on the Tigris, abouttwenty miles south of Mosul.

Ifhospitality is refused, it means that those who refuse itmeditate no good to the would be host.

Butthere was even a better reason in this particular case,which made Jacob's advice sound, and Jacob was, as statedin the next verse, a man of knowledge and experience.Here were eleven strangers dressed alike, in a dress notof the country, talking a strange language, coming in atime of stress, on an errand for which they had nocredentials. Would they not attract undue attention andsuspicion if they went together? Would they not be takenfor spies?-or for men bent on some mischief, theft, ororganised crime? Such a suspicion is referred to in verse73 below. By entering separately they would attractlittle attention. Jacob very wisely tells them to takeall human precautions. But like a Prophet of Allah hewarns them that human precautions would be no good ifthey neglect or run counter to far weightiermatters-Allah's Will and Law. Above all, they must try tounderstand and obey this, and their trust should be onAllah rather than on human usages, institutions, orprecautions, however good and reasonable these might be."

Inxiv. 1 we read, \"A Book revealed to lead out of darknessinto light\": the theme being Abraham's prayer for man tobe rescued from the darkness of false worship into thelight of Unity. Here,in xv.1 we read, \"Ayats (or verses)of Revelation,-of a Qur-an that makes things clear (orperspicuous)\": the theme being an explanation of evil,and how Allah's Truth is protected from it."

The blame isnot even on Satan, the power of evil, it is on the sinnerhimself, who puts himself into his power; xiv. 22: xv.42."

In thereign of a Roman Emperor who persecuted the Christians,seven Christian youths of Ephesus left the town and hidthemselves in a cave in a mountain near by. They fellasleep, and remained asleep for some generations orcenturies. When the wall which sealed up the cave wasbeing demolished, the youths awoke. They still thought ofthe world in which they had previously lived. They had noidea of the duration of time. But when one of them wentto the town to purchase provisions, he found that thewhole world had changed. The Christian religion, insteadof being persecuted was fashionable: in fact it was nowthe State religion. His dress and speech, and the moneywhich he brought, seemed to belong to another world. Thisattracted attention. The great ones of the land visitedthe Cave, and verified the tale by questioning the man'sCompanions. When the story became very popular andcirculated throughout the Roman Empire, we may wellsuppose that an Inscription was put up at the mouth ofthe Cave. See verse 9 and n. 2336. This inscription wasprobably to be seen for many years afterwards, as Ephesuswas a famous city on the west coast of Asia Minor, aboutforty to fifty miles south of Smyrna. Later on, theKhalifa Wathiq (842-846 A.D.) sent an expedition toexamine and identify the locality, as he did about theZul-Qarnain barrier in Central Asia. A popular storycirculating from mouth to mouth would necessarily bevague as to dates and vary very much in details.Somewhere about the 6th century A.D. a Syriac writerreduced it to writing. He suggested that the youths wereseven in number; that they went to sleep in the reign ofthe Emperor Decius (who reigned from 249 to 251 A.D., andwho was a violent persecutor of Christianity); and thatthey awoke in the reign of Theodosius 11, who reignedfrom 408 to 450 A.D. In our literature Decius is known asDaqyanus (from the adjectival Latin from Decianus), andthe name stands as a symbol of injustice and oppression,and also of things old fashioned and out-of-date, as resDecianae must have been two or three centuries afterDecius."

On the other hand, to the men of theCave themselves, it became clear that Allah can changethe situation before we are aware, and our hope in Him isnot futile, and that even when we are on the brink ofdespair, a revolution is surely working in the worldbefore the world itself realises it."

When thetradition was reduced to writing, some Christian writers(e.g., Simeon Metaphrastes) named 372 years, some less.In round numbers 300 years in the solar Calendar wouldamount to 309 in the lunar Calendar. But the next versepoints out that all these are mere conjectures: thenumber is known to Allah alone. The authority on whichGibbon relies mentions two definite reigns, that ofDecius (249-251 A.D.) and that of Theodosius 11 (408-450A.D.). Taking 250 and 450, we get an interval of 200years. But the point of the story does not lie in thename of any given Emperor, but in the fact that thebeginning of the period coincided with an Emperor whopersecuted: the Emperor's name at the end of the periodmay be taken as approximately correct, because the storywas recorded within two generations afterwards. One ofthe worst Emperors to persecute the Christians was Nerowho reigned from 54 to 68. If we took the end of hisreign (A.D. 68) as the initial point, and (say) 440 A.D.as the final point, we get the 372 years of SimeonMetaphrastes. But none of these writers knew any morethan we do. Our best course is to follow the Quranicinjunction, \"Say, Allah knows best how long they stayed\"(xviii. 26). There is also a rebuke implied: 'do notimitate these men who love mischievous controversies!'After all, we are given the narrative more as a parablethan as a story."

(2) Constant effort is necessary to keep ourknowledge square with the march of time, and such effortMoses is shown to be making. (3) The mysterious man hemeets (xviii. 65 and n. 2411), to whom Tradition assignsthe name of Khidhr (literally, Green), is the type ofthat knowledge which is ever in contact with life as itis actually lived. (4) There are paradoxes in life;apparent loss may be real gain; apparent cruelty may bereal mercy; returning good for evil may really be justiceand not generosity (xviii. 79-82).

It may be interesting to pursue thetransformations of the word Samiri in later times. Forits origin see notes 2605 and 2608 above. Whether theroot of Samiri was originally Egyptian or Hebrew does notaffect the later history. Four facts may be noted. (1)There was a man bearing a name of that kind at the timeof Moses, and he led a revolt against Moses and wascursed by Moses. (2) In the time of King Omri (903-896B.C.) of the northern kingdom of Israel, there was a mancalled Shemer, from whom, according to the Bible, wasbought a hill on which was built the new capital of thekingdom, the town of Samaria. (3) The name of the hillwas Shomer (= watchman, vigilant guardian), and that formof the name also appears as the name of a man (see IIKings xii. 21); some authorities think the town wascalled after the hill and not after the man (Hastings'sEncyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics), but this is forour present purposes immaterial. (4) There was and is adissenting community of Israelites called Samaritans, whohave their own separate Pentateuch and Targum, who claimto be the true Children of Israel, and who hold theOrthodox Jews in contempt as the latter hold them incontempt; they claim to be the true guardians (Shomerim)of the Law, and that is probably the true origin of thename Samaritan, which may go further back in time thanthe foundation of the town of Samaria. I think itprobable that the schism originated from the time ofMoses, and that the curse of Moses on the Samiri explainsthe position."

Traditionally the Fire incident is referred to aking called Nimrud, about whom see n. 1565 to xi. 69. IfNimrud's capital was in Assyria, near Nineveh (site nearmodern Mosul), we may suppose either that the king's ruleextended over the whole of Mesopotamia, or that Abrahamwandered north through Babylonia to Assyria. Variousstratagems were devised to get rid of him (xxi. 70), buthe was saved by the mercy of Allah. The final break camewhen he was probably a man of mature age and could speakto his father with some authority. This incident isreferred to in xix. 41-48. He now left his ancestrallands, and avoiding the Syrian desert, came to thefertile lands of Aram or Syria, and so south to Canaan,when the incident of xi. 69-76 took place.

Nothing could be farther from truth than sayingthat he lost his peace of mind or resorted to cursesduring the period of his trial."

The Commentators differ in opinion asto who is meant, why the title is applied to him, and thepoint of his being grouped with Isma'il and Idris forconstancy and patience. I think the best suggestion isthat afforded by Karsten Niebuhr in his Reisebeschreibungnach Arabian, Copenhagen, 1778, ii. 264-266, as quoted inthe Encyclopaedia of Islam under \"Dhul-Kifl\". He visitedMeshad 'All in 'Iraq, and also the little town calledKefil, midway between Najaf and Hilla (Babylon). Kefil,he says, is the Arabic form of Ezekiel. The shrine ofEzekiel was there, and the Jews came to it on pilgrimage.If we accept \"Zul-kifl\" to be not an epithet, but anArabicised form of \"Ezekiel\", it fits the context.Ezekiel was a prophet in Israel who was carried away toBabylon by Nebuchadnezzar after his second attack onJerusalem (about B.C. 599). His Book is included in theEnglish Bible (Old Testament). He was chained and bound,and put into prison, and for a time he was dumb (Ezekiel,iii. 25-26). He bore all with patience and constancy, andcontinued to reprove boldly the evils in Israel. In aburning passage he denounces false leaders in words whichare eternally true: \"Woe be to the shepherds of Israelthat do feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feedthe flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with thewool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not theflock. The diseased have ye not strengthened, neitherhave ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye boundup that which was broken ...... etc. (Ezekiel, xxxiv.2-4). Zul-kifl is again mentioned in xxxviii. 48 alongwith Isma'il and Elisha."

He was the prophet raised to warn theAssyrian capital Nineveh. For Nineveh see n. 1478 to x.98. His story is told in xxxvii. 139-149. When his firstwarning was unheeded by the people, he denounced Allah'swrath on them. But they repented and Allah forgave themfor the time being. Jonah, meanwhile, departed in wrath,discouraged at the apparent failure of his mission. Heshould have remained in the most discouragingcircumstances, and relied on the power of Allah; forAllah had power both over Nineveh and over the MessengerHe had sent to Nineveh. He went away to the sea and tooka ship, but apparently the sailors threw him out as a manof bad omen in a storm. He was swallowed by a big Fish(or Whale), but in the depth of the darkness, he cried toAllah and confessed his weakness. The \"darkness\" may beinterpreted both physically and spiritually; physically,as the darkness of the night and the storm and the Fish'sbody; spiritually as the darkness in his soul, hisextreme distress in the situation which he had brought onhimself. Allah Most Gracious forgave him. He was cast outashore; he was given the shelter of a plant in his stateof mental and physical lassitude. He was refreshed andstrengthened, and the work of his mission prospered. Thushe overcame all his disappointment by repentance andFaith, and Allah accepted him."

For the various stages of creation,see n. 120 to ii. 117. Here we are not concerned with theearliest stage, the creation of primeval matter out ofnothing. It is also a process of creation when inorganicmatter becomes living matter. Thus inorganic constituentsof the earth are absorbed into fiving matter by way offood and living matter reproduces itself by means ofsperm. This is deposited in the ovum and fertilises itand rests for a time in security in the mother's womb.The first change in the fertilised ovum is the conversioninto a sort of clot of thickly congealed blood; thezygote cells grow by segmentation; then the massgradually assumes shape in its growth as a foetus. Fromthe lump develop bones and flesh and organs and a nervoussystem. So far man's growth is like that of an animal,but a further process takes place which makes the infantanimal into the infant man. This is the breathing fromAllah's spirit into him (xv. 29). It may be a continuousprocess parallel to that of physical growth. The child isborn; it grows; it decays and dies; but after deathanother chapter opens for the individual, and it is toremind us of this most momentous chapter that theprevious stages are recapitulated."

As her litter was veiled, itwas not noticed that she was not in it, until the armyreached the next halt. Meanwhile, finding the camp hadgone, she sat down to rest, hoping that some one wouldcome back to fetch her when her absence was noticed. Itwas night, and she fell asleep. Next morning she wasfound by Safwan, a Muhajir, who had been left behind thecamp expressly to pick up anything inadvertently leftbehind. He put her on his camel and brought her, leadingthe camel on foot. This gave occasion to enemies to raisea malicious scandal. The ringleader among them was thechief of Madinah Hypocrites, 'Abudllah ibn Ubai, who isreferred to in the last clause of this verse. He hadother sins and enormities to his debit, and he was leftto the punishment of an unrepentant sinner, for he diedin that state.

In the northern hemispherethe south aspect will give the sun's rays a great part ofthe day, while a north aspect will shut them outaltogether, and vice versa in the southern hemisphere.But a tree in the open plain or on a hill will getperpetual sunshine by day; it will be more mature, andthe fruit and oil will be of superior quality. So Allah'slight is not localised or immature: it is perfect anduniversal."

All these countries except Abyssinia eventuallybecame Muslim, and Abyssinia itself has a considerableMuslim population now and sent some Muslim converts toMadinah in the time of the Prophet himself. As ageneralization it is true that the Jewish and theChristian peoples as they existed in the seventh centuryof the Christian era have been mainly absorbed by Islam,as well as the lands in which they predominated. Remnantsof them built up new nuclei. The Roman Catholic Churchconquered new lands among the northern (Germanic) Pagansand the Byzantine Church among the eastern (Slavonic)Pagans, and the Protestantism of the 16th century gave afresh stimulus to the main ideas for which Islam stands,viz., the abolition of priest craft, the right of privatejudgment, the simplification of ritual, and theinsistence upon the simple, practical, everyday duties oflife."

The reply is thatit is not so much the East as the rising of the sun, onwhich stress is laid.

The Jewishtradition, in order to glorify the younger branch of thefamily, descended from Isaac, ancestor of the Jews, asagainst the elder branch, descended from Isma'il,ancestor of the Arabs, refers this sacrifice to Isaac(Gen. xxii. 1-18). Now Isaac was born when Abraham was100 years old (Gen. xxi. 5), while Isma'il was born toAbraham when Abraham was 86 years old (Gen. xvi. 16).Isma'il was therefore 14 years older than Isaac. Duringhis first 14 years Isma'il was the only son of Abraham;at no time was Isaac the only son of Abraham. Yet, inspeaking of the sacrifice, the Old Testament says (Gen.xxii. 2): \"And He said, Take now thy son, thine only sonIssac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land ofMoriah: and offer him there for a burnt offering...\" Thisslip shows at any rate which was the older version, andhow it was overlaid, like the present Jewish records, inthe interests of a tribal religion. The \"land of Moriah\"is not clear: it was three days' journey from Abraham'splace (Gen. xxii. 4). There is less warrant foridentifying it with the hill of Moriah on which Jerusalemwas afterwards built than with the hill of Marwa which isidentified with the Arab tradition about Isma'il."

The Commentators understand the \"four Days\"in verse 10 to include the two Days in verse 9, so thatthe total for the universe comes to six Days. This isreasonable, because the processes described in verses 9and 10 form really one series. In the one case it is thecreation of the formless matter of the earth; in theother case it is the gradual evolution of the form of theearth, its mountains and seas, and its animal andvegetable life, with the \"nourishment in due proportion\",proper to each.

The twostatements are not inconsistent. It is stated here thatwhen the sky was made into seven firmaments, it hadexisted previously as smoke, or vapour, or steam. Theidea I derive from a collation of the relevant Quranicpassages is that Allah first created primeval matter,which was as yet without order, shape, or symmetry. Thisstate is called Chaos as opposed to Cosmos in GreekCosmogony. The next stage would be the condensation ofthis primeval matter, into gases, liquids, or solids: onthis subject no precise information is given to us: itbelongs to the realm of Physics. About the earth we aretold of four stages or Days, and about the heavens, oftwo stages or Days. For Days see n. 4477 below. If thesestages proceeded or proceed together in time, it isobvious that each stage as we know it on earth is half aslong as each stage in the heavens.

In the Biblical cosmogony,(Gen. i, and ii. 1-7), which reflects old Babyloniancosmogony, the scheme is apparently to be taken literallyas to days and is as follows. The first day Allah createdlight; the second, the firmament; the third, the earthand vegetation; the fourth, the stars and plants; thefifth, fish and fowl from the sea; and the sixth, cattle,creeping things, beasts on land, and man; on the seventhday He ended His work and rested. Our scheme is whollydifferent. (1) Allah did not rest, and never rests. \"HisThrone doth extend over the heavens and the earth, and Hefeeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them\"; (2)Allah's work has not ended; His activity still goes on:xxxii. 5; vii, 54; (3) man in our scheme does not come inwith land animals; his advent is much later; (4) ourstages are not sharply divided from each other, as in theabove scheme, where the stars and planets having beencreated on the fourth day, it is not intelligible how thefirst three days were counted, nor how vegetation grew onthe third day. Our stages for earth and heaven are not insequence of time for the heavens and the earth. Our sixstages are broadly speaking, (1) the throwing off of ourplanet from cosmic matter; (2) its cooling andcondensing; (3) and (4) the growth of vegetable andanimal life; (5) and (6) the parallel growth of thestarry realm and our solar system."

But as eitheror both of these famines lasted as many as seven years,the dates are to be taken very roughly. It is evenpossible that the two famines were continuous, of varyingseverity from year to year. Bukhari mentions only thepost-Hijrat famine, which was apparently so severe thatmen began to eat bones and carrion. Abu Sufyan (about 8A.H.) approached the holy Prophet to intercede and prayfor the removal of the famine, as the Pagans attributedit to the curse of the Prophet. Sura xxiii., which isalso Makkan, but of later date than the present Sura,also refers to a famine: see xxiii. 75, and n. 2921. AsSuras were not all revealed entire, but many camepiecemeal, it is possible that particular verses in agiven Sura may be of different dates from the Sura as awhole."

The majority seemed at first tohave the upper hand when they thought they had crucifiedJesus and killed his Message. But they were soon broughtto their senses. Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus in A.D.70 and the Jews have been scattered ever since. \"TheWandering Jew\" has become a bye-word in many literatures.On the other hand, those who followed Jesus permeated theRoman Empire, brought many new races within their circle,and through the Roman Empire, Christianity became thepredominant religion of the world until the advent ofIslam. So is it promised to the people of Islam: theymust prevail if they adhere to the Truth. Badr (A.H. 2)was a landmark against Pagan Arabia; Qadisiya (A.H. 14)and Madain (A.H. 16) against the might of Persia: Yarmuk(A.H. 15) against the might of the Byzantine Empire inChristian Syria; and Heliopolis (A.H. 19) against thesame Empire in Christian Egypt and Africa. These weresymbols in external events. The moral and spirituallandmarks are less tangible, and more gradual, but nonethe less real. Mark how the arrogance and power ofPriesthood have been quelled; how superstition and abelief in blind Fate have been checked; how the freedomof human individuals has been reconciled with thesanctity of marriage in the law of Divorce; how the civilposition of women has been raised; how temperance andsobriety have been identified with religion; what impetushas been given to knowledge and experimental science; andhow economic reconstruction has been pioneered byrational schemes for the expenditure and distribution ofwealth."

The Jewish command forbids work on that day butsays nothing about worship or prayer (Exod. xx. 10); ourordinance lays chief stress on the remembrance of Allah.Jewish formalism went so far as to kill the spirit of thesabbath, and call forth the protest of Jesus: \"thesabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath\"(Mark. ii. 27). But the Christian Church, although it haschanged the day from Saturday to Sunday, has inheritedthe Jewish spirit: witness the Scottish Sabbath; exceptin so far as it has been secularised. Our teaching says:'When the time for Jumua Prayer comes, close yourbusiness and answer the summons loyally and earnestly,meet earnestly, pray, consult and learn by socialcontact; when the meeting is over, scatter and go aboutyour business'."

See n. 3706 toxxxiii. 28. But they were human beings after all, andwere subject to the weaknesses of their sex, and theysometimes failed. The commentators usually cite thefollowing incident in connection with the revelation ofthese verses. It is narrated from 'Aisha, the wife of theholy Prophet (peace be on him) by Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai.Abu Dawud and others that the holy Prophet usuallyvisited all his wives daily after 'Asr Prayer. Once it sohappened that he stayed longer than usual at the quartersof Zainab bint Jahsh, for she had received from somewheresome honey which the holy Prophet liked very much. \"Atthis\", says 'Aisha, \"I felt jealous, and Hafsa, Sawda,Safiya, and I agreed among ourselves that when he visitsus each of us would tell him that a peculiar odour camefrom his mouth as a result of what he had eaten, for weknew that he was particularly sensitive to offensivesmells\". So when his wives hinted at it, he vowed that hewould never again use honey. Thereupon these verses wererevealed reminding him that he should not declare tohimself unlawful that which Allah had made lawful to him.The important point to bear in mind is that he was atonce rectified by revelation, which reinforces the factthat the prophets are always under divine protection, andeven the slightest lapse on their part is never leftuncorrected."

In the Midrash also,which was a Jewish school of exegesis and mysticalinterpretation, there was much said about angels. TheEastern Christian sects contemporary with the birth ofIslam had borrowed and developed many of these ideas, andtheir mystics owed much to the Gnostics and the Persianapocalyptic systems. In the New Testament the relation ofthe angels with Fire is referred to more than once. InRev. ix. 11 we have \"the angel of the bottomless pit,whose naine in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in theGreek tongue hath his name Apollyon\". In Rev. xiv. 18there is an \"angel which had power over fire\", and inRev. xvi. 8 an angel has \"power ... given unto him toscorch men with fire\". In the Old Testament (Daniel vii.9-10) the essence of all angels is fire: thousandthousands of them issued as a fiery stream from beforethe Ancient of Days, whose \"throne was like the fieryflame, and His wheels as burning fire\"."

But man'sposition as vicegerent also gives him will anddiscretion, and if he uses them wrongly he falls evenlower than the beasts. See next note."

Off they go, strikingfire with their hoofs by night at the behest of theirriders; they push home the charge in the moming,chivalrously giving the enemy the benefit of daylight;and regardless of flashing steel or the weapons of theirenemies they boldly penetrate into the midst of theirfoe, risking their lives for the Cause. Does unregenerateman show that fidelity to his Lord Allah? On the contraryhe is ungrateful to Allah; he shows that by his deeds; heis violently in love with wealth and gain and things thatperish. (2) By the figure of metonymy the brave fidelityof the war-horse may stand for that of the brave men andtrue who rally to the standard of Allah and carry it tovictory, contrasted with the poltroonery and pettiness ofunregenerate man. (3) The whole conflict, fighting, andvictory, may be applied to spiritual warfare againstthose who are caught and overwhelmed in the camp of Evil."
