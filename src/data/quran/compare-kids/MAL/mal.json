Allahknows that you were committing dishonesty to your souls. So Hehas relented towards you and pardoned you. Now, you may approachyour wives and seek what Allah has written for you. Eat and drinkuntil the white thread of dawn appears to you distinct from theblack thread of night, then complete your fast till nightfall. Donot approach your wives during I'htikaf (retreat in the mosquesin last ten days of Ramadhan). These are the limits set by Allah:do not ever violate them. Thus Allah makes His revelations clearto mankind so that they may guard themselves against evil."
