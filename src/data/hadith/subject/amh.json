He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrieved over her intensely and lamented her until he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithdrew into a house and locked himself in, hidden from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teveryone, and no-one visited him. A woman heard about him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand went to him, saying, 'I need him to give me an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topinion. Nothing will satisfy me except what he says\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout it.' Everyone went away, but she stuck to his door\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand said, 'I must see him.' Someone said to him, 'There\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis a woman who wishes to ask your opinion about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething,' and she insisted, 'I will only talk to him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout it.'  When everyone had gone away, and she still\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad not left his door, he said, 'Let her in.' So she went\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin and saw him and said, 'I have come to ask your opinion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout something.'  He said, 'What is it?' She said, 'I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tborrowed a piece of jewellery from a neighbour of mine,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand I have worn it and used it for a long time. Then they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsent to me for it.

He said, 'It is more correct for you to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn it to them, since they have lent it to you for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch a long time.'  She said, 'Yes. May Allah have mercy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton you. Do you then grieve over what Allah has lent you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand then taken from you, when He has a greater right to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit than you?'

Even if it stays with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe borrower for a number of years before the lender\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcollects it, the lender only has to pay zakat on it once.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf he collects an amount of the debt which is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakatable, and has other wealth which is zakatable, then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat he has collected of the debt is added to the rest of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this wealth and he pays zakat on the total sum.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik continued, \"If he has no ready money other than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat which he has collected from his debt, and that does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot reach a zakatable amount, then he does not have to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpay any zakat.

If what he takes back reaches\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwenty dinars of gold, or two hundred dirhams of silver\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the pays zakat on it.

This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause the one who is owed the debt, or owns the goods,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould not have to take the zakat on the debt, or the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoods, from anything else, since the zakat on anything is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly taken from the thing itself, and not from anything\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"Our position regarding some onewho owes a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdebt, and has goods which are worth enough to pay off the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdebt, and also has an amount of ready money which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakatable, is that he pays the zakat on the ready money\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich he has to hand.  If, however, he only has enough\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoods and ready money to pay off the debt, then he does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot have to pay any zakat. But if the ready money that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas reaches a zakatable amount over and above the amount\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the debt that he owes, then he must pay zakat on it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

(The nisab is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tminimum amount on which zakat has to be paid, either five\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thead of camels, or thirty cattle, or forty sheep and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoats).

He used to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinclude sakhlas (when assessing zakat), and they said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Do you include sakhlas even though you do not take them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(as payment)?\"\\tHe returned to Umar ibn al-Khattab and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned that to him and Umar said, \"Yes, you include a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsakhla which the shepherd is carrying, but you do not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttake it. Neither do you take an akula, or a rubba, or a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmakhid, or male sheep and goats in their second and third\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyears, and this is a just compromise between the young of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsheep and goats and the best of them.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"A sakhla is a newborn lamb or kid. A rubba\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis a mother that is looking after her offspring, a makhid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis a pregnant ewe or goat, and an akula is a sheep or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoat that is being fattened for meat.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, about a man who had sheep and goats on which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the did not have to pay any zakat, but which increased by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbirth to a zakatable amount on the day before the zakat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcollector came to them, \"If the number of sheep and goats\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talong with their (newborn) offspring reaches a zakatable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamount then the man has to pay zakat on them. That is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause the offspring of the sheep are part of the flock\\n\\t\\t\\t\\titself.

If his profit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad been a chance acquisition or an inheritance he would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot have had to pay zakat on it until one year had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telapsed over it from the day he had acquired it or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinherited it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"The young of sheep and goats are part of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflock, in the same way that profit from wealth is part of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat wealth.

Whereas a man who has a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakatable amount of sheep and goats, or cattle, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcamels, and then acquires another camel, cow, sheep or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoat, pays zakat on it at the same time that he pays the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakat on the others of its kind, if he already has a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakatable amount of livestock of that particular kind.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"This is the best of what I have heard about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis. \"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

There are also certain kinds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof fruit which are not taken as zakat, such as burdi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdates (one of the finest kinds of dates), and similar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvarieties.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNeither the lowest quality (of any property) nor the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thighest should be taken.

They are estimated when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir usability is clear and they are halal to sell. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis because the fruit of date-palms and vines is eaten\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstraightaway in the form of fresh dates and grapes, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso the assessment is done by estimation to make things\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teasier for people and to avoid causing them trouble.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTheir produce is estimated and then they are given a free\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thand in using their produce as they wish, and later they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpay the zakat on it according to the estimation that was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"crops which are not eaten fresh, such as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrains and seeds, which are only eaten after they have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen harvested, are not estimated. The owner, after he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas harvested, threshed and sifted the crop, so that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis then in the form of grain or seed, has to fulfil his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrust himself and deduct the zakat he owes if the amount\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis large enough for him to have to pay zakat. This is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tposition that we are all agreed upon here (in Madina).\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"The position that we are all agreed upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\there (in Madina) is that the produce of date palms is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testimated while it is still on the tree, after it has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tripened and become halal to sell, and the zakat on it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeducted in the form of dried dates at the time of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tharvest. If the fruit is damaged after it has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testimated and the damage affects all the fruit then no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakat has to be paid.

The explanation of this is that when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta man harvests five awsuq of dates (from his palms), he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadds them all together and deducts the zakat from them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven if they are all of different kinds and varieties. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the same with different kinds of cereal, such as brown\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twheat, white wheat, barley and sult, which are all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsidered as one category. If a man reaps five awsuq of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany of these, he adds it all together and pays zakat on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit. If it does not come to that amount he does not have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto pay any zakat. It is the same (also) with grapes,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhether they be black or red. If a man picks five awsuq\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof them he has to pay zakat on them, but if they do not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcome to that amount he does not have to pay any zakat.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPulses also are considered as one category, like cereals,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdates and grapes, even if they are of different varieties\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand are called by different names. Pulses include\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchick-peas, lentils, beans, peas, and anything which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagreed by everybody to be a pulse. If a man harvests five\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tawsuq of pulses, measuring by the aforementioned sa, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsa of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace, he collects them all together and must pay zakat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton them, even if they are of every kind of pulse and not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjust one kind.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, ''Umar ibn al-Khattab drew a distinction\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween pulses and wheat when he took zakat from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNabatean christians. He considered all pulses to be one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategory and took a tenth from them, and from cereals and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\traisins he took a twentieth.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"If some one asks, 'How can pulses be added\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tup all together when assessing the zakat so that there is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjust one payment, when a man can barter two of one kind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor one of another, while cereals can not be bartered at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta rate of two to one?', then tell him, 'Gold and silver\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare collected together when assessing the zakat, even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthough an amount of gold dinars can be exchanged for many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttimes tha tamount of silver dirhams.' \"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, regarding date palms which are shared equally\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween two men, and from which eight awsuq of dates are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tharvested, \"They do not have to pay any zakat on them. If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone man owns five awsuq of what is harvested from one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpiece of land, and the other owns four awsuq or less, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone who owns the five awsuq has to pay zakat, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother one, who harvested four awsuq or less, does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave to pay zakat. This is how things are done whenever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere are associates in any crop, whether the crop is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrain or seeds that are reaped, or dates that are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tharvested, or grapes that are picked . Any one of them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat harvests five awsuq of dates, or picks five awsuq of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrapes, or reaps five awsuq of wheat, has to pay zakat,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand whoever's portion is less than five awsuq does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave to pay zakat.

If he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsays the takbir he should not stop until he has prayed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo rakas. If he is fasting he should not break his fast\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuntil he has completed that day's fast. If he goes into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tihram he should not return until he has completed his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thajj, and if he begins doing tawaf he should not stop\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoing so until he has gone around the Kaba seven times.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe should not stop doing any of these actions once he has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstarted them until he has completed them, except if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething happens such as illness or some other matter by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich a man is excused. This is because Allah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBlessed and Exalted, says in His Book, 'And eat and drink\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuntil the white thread becomes clear to you from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblack thread of dawn, (and) then complete the fast until\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnight-time,' (Sura 2 ayat 187), and so he must complete\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this fast as Allah has said. Allah, the Exalted, (also)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsays, 'And complete the hajj and the umra forAllah,' and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso if a man were to go into ihram for a voluntary hajj\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thaving done his one obligatory hajj (on a previous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccasion), he could not then stop doing his hajj having\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonce begun it and leave ihram while in the middle of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thajj.

Malik said, \"The generally\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagreed on way of doing things among us and what I have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseen the people of knowledge in our city doing is that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe paternal grandfather does not inherit anything at all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the father. He is given a sixth as a fixed share\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the son and the grandson through a son. Other than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat, when the deceased does not leave a mother or a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpaternal aunt, one begins with whoever has a fixed share,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand they are given their shares. If there is a sixth of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe property left over, the grandfather is given a sixth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas a fixed share.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"When someone shares with the grandfather and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe full siblings in a specified share, one begins with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhoever shares with them of the people of fixed shares.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey are given their shares. What is left over after that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelongs to the grandfather and the full siblings. Then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone sees which is the more favourable of two alternatives\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the portion of the grandfather. Either a third is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallotted to him and the siblings to divide between them,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand he gets a share as if he were one of the siblings, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse he takes a sixth from all the capital. Whichever is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe best portion for the grandfather is given to him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is left after that, goes to the full siblings. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmale gets the portion of two females except in one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticular case. The division in this case is different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the preceding one. This case is when a woman dies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand leaves a husband, mother, full sister and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrandfather. The husband gets a half, the mother gets a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthird, the grandfather gets a sixth, and the full sister\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgets a half. The sixth of the grandfather and the half of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sister are joined and divided into thirds. The male\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgets the share of two females.

The males are the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas their males and the females are the same as their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfemales. When there are both full siblings and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thalf-siblings by the father, the full siblings include in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir number the number of half-siblings by the father,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto limit the inheritance of the grandfather, i.e., if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere was only one full sibling with the grandfather.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey would share, after the allotting of the fixed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshares, the remainder of the inheritance between them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tequally. If there were also two half-siblings by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfather, their number is added to the division of the sum,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich would then be divided four ways. A quarter going to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe grandfather and three-quarters going to the full\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsiblings who annex the shares technically allotted to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thalf-siblings by the father. They do not include the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnumber of half-siblings by the mother, because if there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere only half-siblings by the father they would not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinherit anything with the grandfather and all the capital\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould belong to the grandfather, and so the siblings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould not get anything after the portion of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrandfather.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"It belongs to the full siblings more than the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thalf-siblings by the father, and the half-siblings by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfather do not get anything with them unless the full\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsiblings consist of one sister.

To understand why\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat was disapproved of in that case, the example of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman who sold a slave-girl on credit and then bought her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tback on a credit term longer than the original term was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlooked at. He might have sold her for thirty dinars with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta month to pay and then buy her back for sixty dinars\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith a year or half a year to pay. The outcome would only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe that his goods would have returned to him just like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were and the other party would have given him thirty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdinars on a month's credit against sixty dinars on a year\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor half a year's credit.

If he knew that there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas a fault and concealed it, his declaration that he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfree of responsibility does not absolve him, and what he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsold is returned to him.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik spoke about a situation where a slave-girl was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbartered for two other slave-girls and then one of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave-girls was found to have a defect for which she\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould be returned. He said, \"The slave-girl worth two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother slave-girls is valued for her price. Then the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo slave-girls are valued, ignoring the defect which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone of them has. Then the price of the slave-girl sold\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor two slave-girls is divided between them according to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir prices so that the proportion of each of them in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther price is arrived at - to the higher priced one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to her higher price, and to the other according\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto her value. Then one looks at the one with the defect,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the buyer is refunded according to the amount her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare is affected by the defect, be it little or great.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe price of the two slave-girls is based on their market\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvalue on the day that they were bought.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik spoke about a man who bought a slave and hired him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout on a long-term or short-term basis and then found out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the slave had a defect which necessitated his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn. He said that if the man returned the slave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause of the defect, he kept the hire and revenue.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"This is the way in which things are done in our city.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThat is because, had the man bought a slave who then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbuilt a house for him, and the value of the house was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmany times the price of the slave, and he then found that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe slave had a defect for which he could be returned,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand he\\twas returned, he would not have to make payment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the work the slave had done for him.

Everything\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich resembles this is also forbidden.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said that another example of that was, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance, a man proposing to another man, \"You have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcloth. I will guarantee you from this cloth of yours so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmany hooded cloaks, the measureof each cloak to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch-and-such, (naming a measurement). Whatever loss\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is, is against me and I will fulfill you the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecified amount and whatever excess there is, is mine.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOr perhaps the man proposed, \"I will guarantee you from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis cloth of yours so many shirts, the measurement of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teach shirt to be such-and-such, and whatever loss there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis, is against me and I will fulfill the specified amount\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand whatever excess there is, is mine.\" Or perhaps a man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproposed to a man who had cattle or camel hides, \"I will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcut up these hides of yours into sandals on a pattern I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill show you. Whatever falls short of a hundred pairs, I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill make up its loss and whatever is over is mine\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause I guaranteed you.\" Another example was that a man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay to a man who had ben-nuts, \"I will press these nuts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof yours. Whatever falls short of such-and-such a weight\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the pound, I will make it up, and whatever is more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan that is mine.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said that all this and whatever else was like it or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresembled it was in the category of muzabana, which was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneither good nor permitted. It was also the same case for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta man to say to a man, who had fodder leaves, date\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkernels, cotton, flax, herbs or safflower, \"I will buy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese leaves from you in exchange for such-and-such a sa,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(indicating leaves which are pounded like his leaves) . .\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor these date kernels for such-and-such a sa of kernels\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike them, and the like of that in the case of safflower,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcotton, flax and herbs.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"All this is what we have described of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmuzabana.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

That is like buying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toil from a container. A man buys some of it for a dinar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor two and gives his gold and stipulates that it be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeasured out for him. There is no harm in that. If the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontainer breaks and the oil is wasted, the buyer has his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgold back and there is no transaction between them.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"There is no harm in everything which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken right away as it is, like fresh milk and fresh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpicked dates which the buyer can take on a day-to-day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbasis. If the supply runs out before the buyer has what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the has paid for in full, the seller gives him back the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tportion of the gold that is owed to him, or else the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbuyer takes other goods from him to the value of what he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis owed and which they mutually agree about. The buyer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould stay with the seller until he has taken it. It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisapproved of for the seller to leave because the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttransaction would then come into the forbidden category\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof a debt for a debt. If a stated time period for payment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor delivery enters into the transaction, it is also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisapproved. Delay and deferment are not permitted in it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand are only acceptable when it is standard practice on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefinite terms by which the seller guarantees it to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbuyer, but this is not to be from one specific orchard or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom any specific ewes.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik was asked about a man who bought an orchard from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother man in which there were various types of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpalm-trees - excellent ajwa palms, good kabis palms, adhq\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpalms and othertypes. The seller kept aside from the sale\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe produce of a certain palm of his choice. Malik said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"That is not good because if he does that, and keeps\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taside, for instance, dates of the ajwa variety whose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyield would be 15 sa, and he picks the dates of the kabis\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin their place, and the yield of their dates is 10 sa or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the picks the ajwa which yield 15 sa and leaves the kabis\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich yield 10 sa, it is as if he bought the ajwa for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkabis making allowances for their difference of quality.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is the same as if a man dealing with a man who has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theaps of dates before him - a heap of 15 sa of ajwa, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theap of 10 sa of kabis, and a heap of 12 sa of cadhq,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgives the owner of the dates a dinar to let him choose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand take whichever of the heaps he likes.\" Malik said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"That is not good.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik was asked what a man who bought fresh dates from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe owner of an orchard and advanced him a dinar was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentitled to if the crop was spoilt. Malik said, \"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbuyer makes a reckoning with the owner of the orchard and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttakes what is due to him of the dinar. If the buyer has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken two-thirds of a dinar's worth of dates, he gets\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tback the third of a dinar which is owed him. If the buyer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas taken three-quarters of a dinar's worth of dates,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen he gets back the quarter which is owed to him, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey come to a mutual agreement, and the buyer takes what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis owed him from his dinar from the owner of the orchard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin something else of his choosing. If, for instance, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprefers to take dry dates or some other goods, he takes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem according to what is due. If he takes dry dates or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome other goods, he should stay with him until he has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen paid in full.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"This is the same situation as hiring out a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecified riding-camel or hiring out a slave tailor,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcarpenter or some other kind of worker or letting a house\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand taking payment in advance for the hire of the slave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor the rent of the house or camel. Then an accident\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappens to what has been hired resulting in death or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething else. The owner of the camel, slave or house\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturns what remains of the rent of the camel, the hire\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the slave or the rent of the house to the one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadvanced him the money, and the owner reckons what will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettle that up in full. If, for instance, he has provided\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thalf of what the man paid for, he returns the remaining\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thalf of what he advanced, or according to whatever amount\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis due.\" Malik said, \"Paying in advance for something\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich is on hand is only good when the buyer takes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossession of what he has paid for as soon as he hands\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover the gold, whether it be slave, camel, or house, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the case of dates, he starts to pick them as soon as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the has paid the money.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is not good that there be any deferment or credit in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch a transaction.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"An example illustrating what is disapproved\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof in this situation is that, for instance, a man may say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he will pay someone in advance for the use of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcamel to ride in the hajj, and the hajj is still some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime off, or he may say something similar to that about a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave or a house. When he does that, he only pays the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmoney in advance on the understanding that if he finds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe camel to be sound at the time the hire is due to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegin, he will take it by virtue of what he has already\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpaid. If an accident, or death, or something happens to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe camel, then he will get his money back and the money\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the paid in advance will be considered as a loan.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"This is distinct from someone who takes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timmediate possession of what he rents or hires, so that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit does not fall into the category of 'uncertainty,' or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisapproved payment in advance. That is following a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommon practice. An example of that is that a man buys a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave, or slave-girl, and takes possession of them and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpays their price. If something happens to them within the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod of the year indemnification contract, he takes his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgold back from the one from whom he bought it. There is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno harm in that. This is the precedent of the sunna in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe matter of selling slaves.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"Someone who rents a specified slave, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thires a specified camel, for a future date, at which time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the will take possession of the camel or slave, has not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacted properly because he did not take possession of what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the rented or hired, nor is he advancing a loan which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson is responsible to pay back.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

He did not want there to be any delay or deferment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin any such sale, whether it involved one commodity or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifferent sorts of commodities.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

He poured his gold into one pan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the scales, and the man with whom he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcounterpoising put his gold in the other pan of the scale\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand when the tongue of the scales was balanced, they took\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand gave.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"According to the way things are done among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tus there is no harm in selling gold for gold, and silver\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor silver by counterpoising weight, even if 11 dinars\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare taken for 10 dinars hand to hand, when the weight of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgold is equal, coin for coin, even if the number is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifferent. Dirhams in such a situation are treated the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame way as dinars.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"If, when counterpoising gold for gold or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsilver for silver, there is a difference of weight, one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparty should not give the other the value of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifference in silver or something else. Such a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttransaction is ugly and a means to usury because if one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the parties were permitted to take the difference for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta separate price, it could be as if he had bought it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseparately, so he would be permitted. Then it would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible for him to ask for  many times the value of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifference in order to permit the completion of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttransaction between the two parties.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"If he had really been sold the difference\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout anything else with it, he would not have taken it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor a tenth of the price for which he took it in order to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tput a 'legal front' on the transaction. This leads to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallowing what is forbidden . The matter is forbidden.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said that it was not good when counterpoising to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgive good old gold coins and put along with them unminted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgold in exchange for worn kufic gold, which was unpopular\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand to then treat the exchange as like for like.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"The commentary on why that is disapproved is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the owner of the good gold uses the excellence of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this old gold coins as an excuse to throw in the unminted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgold with it. Had it not been for the superiority of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(good) gold over the gold of the other party, the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparty would not have counterpoised the unminted gold for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this kufic gold, and the deal would have been refused.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"It is like a man wanting to buy three sa of ajwa dried\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdates for two sa and a mudd of kabis dates, and on being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttold that it was not good, then offering two sa of kabis\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand a sa of poor dates desiring to make the sale\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible. That is not good because the owner of the ajwa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould not give him a sa of ajwa for a sa of poor dates.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe would only give him that because of the excellence of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkabis dates.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Or it is like a man asking some one to sell him three sa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof white wheat for two and a half sa of Syrian wheat, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing told that it was not good except like for like, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso offering two sa of wheat and one sa of barley\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintending to make the sale possible between them. That is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot good because no one would have given a sa of barley\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor a sa of white wheat had that sa been by itself. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas only given because of the excellence of Syrian wheat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover the white wheat. This is not good. It is the same as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe case of the unminted gold.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"Where gold, silver and food, things which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould only be sold like for like, are concerned,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething disliked and of poor quality should not be put\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith something good and desirable in order to make the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsale possible and to make a bad situation halal. When\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething of desirable quality is put with something of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoor quality and it is only included so that its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcellence in quality is noticed, something is being sold\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich if it had been sold on its own, would not have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccepted and to which the buyer would not have paid any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattention. It is only accepted by the buyer because of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe superiority of what comes with it over his own goods.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTransactions involving gold, silver, or food, must not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave anything of this description enter into them. If the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towner of the poor quality goods wants to sell them, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsells them on their own, and does not put anything with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem. There is no harm if it is like that.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

He does not buy anything\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse from the man for the same price until he has got\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tback what he paid. That is because if he took something\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse besides the price which he paid him or exchanged it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor goods other than the goods which he bought from him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit would be selling food before getting delivery of it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand grant him peace, forbade selling food before getting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdelivery of it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said that it was not good if the buyer regretted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this purchase and asked the seller to revoke the sale for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim and he would not press him immediately for what he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad paid. The people of knowledge forbade that. That was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause when the food was made ready for the buyer by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseller, the buyer deferred his due from the seller in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torder that he might revoke the sale for him.

Revocation is that in which neither\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe buyer nor the seller is increased. When increase\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurs by deferment of payment for a time period, or by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything which increases one of them over the other or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything which gives one of them profit, it is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevocation.

Had he sold them to some one other than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe person from whom he had purchased them, there would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot have been any harm in it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"The generally agreed on way of doing things\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong us concerning making an advance for slaves, cattle\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor goods is that when all of what is to be sold is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescribed and an advance is made for them for a date, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe date falls due, the buyer does not sell any of that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the person from whom he has purchased it for more than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe price which he advanced for it before he has taken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfull possession of what he has advanced for. It is usury\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif he does. If the buyer gives the seller dinars or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdirhams and he profits with them, then, when the goods\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcome to the buyer and he does not take them into his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossession but sells them back to their owner for more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan what he advanced for them, the outcome is that what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the has advanced has returned to him and has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincreased for him.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"If someone advances gold or silver for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescribed animals or goods which are to be delivered\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore a named date, and the date arrives, or it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore or after the date, there is no harm in the buyer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tselling those goods to the seller, for other goods, to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken immediately and not delayed, no matter how\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textensive the amount of those goods is, except in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcase of food because it is not halal to sell it before he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas full possession of it.

A man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsays, 'I will take him from you for twenty dinars.'

If he sells\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe stock at a loss, he has nothing, and his efforts are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot compensated. This is not good.

Share-cropping is conducted on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbasis that all the care and expense is outlayed by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare-cropper, and the owner of the property is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobliged anything. This is the accepted method of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare-cropping.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik spoke about a spring which was shared between two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen, and then the water dried up and one of them wanted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto work on the spring and the other said, \"I don't have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe means to work on it.\" He said, \"Tell the one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twants to work on the spring, 'Work and expend. All the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twater will be yours. You will have its water until your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanion brings you half of what you have spent. If he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrings you half of what you have spent, he can take his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare of the water.' The first one is given all the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twater, because he has spent on it, and if he does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treach anything by his work, the other has not incurred\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany expense.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, -It is not good for a share-cropper not to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpend anything but his labour and to be hired for a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare of the fruit while all the expense and work is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincurred by the owner of the garden, because the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare-cropper does not know what the exact wage is going\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto be for his labour, whether it will be little or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreat.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"No-one who lends a qirad or grants a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare-cropping contract, should exempt some of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twealth, or some of the trees from his agent, because, by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat, the agent becomes his hired man. He says, 'I will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrant you a share-crop provided that you work for me on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch-and-such a palm - water it and tend it. I will give\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou a qirad for such-and-such money provided that you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twork for me with ten dinars. They are not part of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqirad I have given you.' That must not be done and it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot good. This is what is done in our community.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"The sunna about what is permitted to an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towner of a garden in share-cropping is that he can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstipulate to the share-cropper the maintenance of walls,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcleaning the spring, sweeping the irrigation canals,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpollinating the palms, pruning branches, harvesting the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfruit and such things, provided that the share-cropper\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas a share of the fruit fixed by mutual agreement.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, the owner cannot stipulate the beginning of new\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twork which the agent will start digging a well, raising\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe source of a well, instigating new planting, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbuilding a cistern whose cost is great. That is as if the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towner of the garden said to a certain man, 'Build me a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thouse here or dig me a well or make a spring flow for me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor do some work for me for half the fruit of this garden\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof mine,' before the fruit of the garden is sound and it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis halal to sell it. This is the sale of fruit before its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgood condition is clear. The Messenger of Allah, may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah bless him and grant him peace, forbade fruit to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsold before its good condition became clear.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"If the fruits are good and their good\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition is clear and selling them is halal and then the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towner asks a man to do one of those jobs for him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecifying the job, for half the fruit of his garden, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texample, there is no harm in that. He has hired the man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor something recognised and known. The man has seen it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand is satisfied with it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"As for share-cropping, if the garden has no fruit or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlittle or bad fruit, he has only that. The labourer is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly hired for a set amount, and hire is only permitted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton these terms. Hire is a type of sale. One man buys\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother man's work from him. It is not good if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuncertainty enters into it because the Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuncertain transactions.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"The sunna in share-cropping with us is that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit can be practised with any kind of fruit tree, palm,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvine, olive tree, pomegranate, peach, and soon. It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermitted, and there is no harm in it provided that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towner of the property has a share of the fruit: a half or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta third or a quarter or whatever.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"Share-cropping is also permitted in any crop\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich emerges from the earth if it is a crop which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpicked, and its owner cannot water, work on it and tend\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Share-cropping becomes reprehensible in anything in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich share-cropping is normally permitted if the fruit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis sound and the good condition is clear and it is halal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto sell it. He must share-crop in it the next year. If a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman waters fruit whose good condition is clear and it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thalal to sell it, and he picks it for the owner, for a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare of the crop -it is not sharecropping. It is similar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto him being paid in dirhams and dinars. Share-cropping\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis what is between pruning the palms and when the fruit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecomes sound and its sale is halal.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"If some one makes a share-cropping contract\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor fruit trees before the condition becomes clear and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits sale is halal, it is share-cropping and is permitted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t. \"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"Uncultivated land must not be involved in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare-cropping contract. That is because it is halal for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe owner to rent it for dinars and dirhams or the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tequivalent for an accepted price.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"As for a man who gives his uncultivated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearth for a third or a fourth of what comes out of it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat is an uncertain transaction because crops may be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscant one time and plentiful another time. It may perish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompletely and the owner of the land will have abandoned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta set rent which would have been good for him to rent the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tland for. He takes an uncertain situation, and does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknow whether or not it will be satisfactory. This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisapproved. It is like a man having someone travel for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim for a set amount, and then saying, 'Shall I give you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta tenth of the profit of the journey as your wage?' This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis not halal and must not be done.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik summed up,\"A man must not hire out himself or his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tland or his ship unless for a set amount.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"A distinction is made between sharecropping\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin palms and in cultivated land because the owner of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpalms cannot sell the fruit until its good condition is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclear. The owner of the land can rent it when it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuncultivated with nothing on it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"What is done in our community about palms is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they can also be share-cropped for three and four\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyears, and less or more than that.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"That is what I have heard. Any fruit trees\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike that are in the position of palms. Contracts for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseveral years are permissible for the sharecropper as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey are permissible in the palms.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said about the owner, \"He does not take anything\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadditional from the share-cropper in the way of gold or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsilver or crops which increases him. That is not good.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe share-cropper also must not take from the owner of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe garden anything additional which will increase him of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgold, silver, crops or anything. Increase beyond what is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstipulated in the contract is not good. It is also not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgood for the lender of a qirad to be in this position. If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch an increase does enter share-cropping or quirad, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecomes by it hire. It is not good when hire enters it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHire must never occur in a situation which has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuncertainty in it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik spoke about a man who gave land to another man in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare-cropping contract in which there were palms, vines,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor the like of that of fruit trees and there was also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuncultivated land in it. He said, \"If the uncultivated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tland is secondary to the fruit trees, either in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportance or in size of land, there is no harm in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare-cropping. That is if the palms take up two-thirds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the land or more, and the uncultivated land is a third\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor less. This is because when the land that the fruit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrees take up is secondary to the uncultivated land and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe cultivated land in which the palms, vines or the like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis a third or less, and the uncultivated land is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo-thirds or more, it is permitted to rent the land and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare-cropping in it is haram.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"One of the practices of people is to give out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsharecropping contracts on property with fruit trees when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is uncultivated land in it, and to rent land while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere are fruit trees on it, just as a Qur'an or sword\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich has some embellishment on it of silver is sold for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsilver, or a necklace or ring which have stones and gold\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin them are sold for dinars. These sales continue to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermitted. People buy and sell by them. Nothing described\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor instituted has come on that which if exceeded, makes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit haram, and if fallen below makes it halal. What is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdone in our community about that is what people practise\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand permit among themselves. That is, if the gold or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsilver is secondary to what it is incorporated in, it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermitted to sell it. That is, if the value of the blade,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qur'an, or the stones is two-thirds or more, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvalue of the decoration is one-third or less.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

Malik\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"If it seems likely that the partner can meet the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterms, he has right of pre-emption for the same credit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterms. If it is feared that he will not be able to meet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe terms, but he can bring a wealthy and reliable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguarantor of equal standing to the one who bought into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe land, he can also take possession.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"A person's absence does not sever his right\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof pre-emption. Even if he is a way for a long time,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is no time limit after which the right of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreemption is cut off.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said that if a man left land to a number of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchildren, then one of them who had a child died and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchild of the deceased sold his right in that land, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrother of the seller was more entitled to pre-empt him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan his paternal uncles, the partners of his father.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"This is what is done in our community.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"Pre-emption is shared between partners\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to their existing shares. Each of them takes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to his portion. If it is small, he has little.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf it is great, it is according to that. That is if they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare tenacious and contend with each other about it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"As for a man who buys out the share of one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his partners, and one of the other partners says, 'I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill take a portion according to my share,' and the first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpartner says, 'If you wish to take all the preemption, I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill give it up to you. If you wish to leave it, then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleave it.' If the first partner gives him the choice and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thands it over to him, the second partner can only take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall the pre-emption or give it back. If he takes it, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis entitled to it. If not, he has nothing.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik spoke about a man who bought land, and developed it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby planting trees or digging a well etc., and then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomeone came, and seeing that he had a right in the land,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twanted to take possession of it by pre-emption. Malik\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid \"He has no right of preemption unless he compensates\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe other for his expenditure. If he gives him the price\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof what he has developed, he is entitled to pre-emption .\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf not, he has no right in it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said that someone who sold off his portion of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshared house or land and then, on learning that some one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith a right of pre-emption was to take possession by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat right, asked the buyer to revoke the sale, and he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid so, did not have the right to do that. The pre-emptor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas more right to the property for the price for which he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsold it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the case of some one who bought along with a section\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof a shared house or land, an animal and goods (that were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot shared), so that when any one demanded his right of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpre-emption in the house or land he said, \"Take what I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave bought altogether, for I bought it altogether,\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"The pre-emptor need only take possession of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe house or land. Each thing the man bought is assessed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to its share of the lump sum the man paid. Then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe pre-emptor takes possession of his right for a price\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich is appropriate on that basis. He does not take any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanimals or goods unless he wants to do that.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"If someone sells a section of shared land,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand one of those who have the right of preemption\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurrenders it to the buyer and another refuses to do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother than take his pre-emption, the one who refuses to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurrender has to take all the preemption, and he cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttake according to his right and leave what remains.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the case where one of a number of partners in one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thouse sold his share when all his partners were away\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcept for one man, the one present was given the choice\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof either taking the pre-emption or leaving it, and he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'I will take my portion and leave the portions of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmy partners until they are present. If they take it, that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis that. If they leave it, I will take all the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpre-emption,' Malik said, 'He can only take it all or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleave it. If his partners come, they can take from him or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleave it as they wish.

Malik said, \"They cannot do that until the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbuyer has taken possession and the sale is confirmed for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim. When the sale is confirmed, they have the right of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpre-emption.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik spoke about a man who bought land and it remained\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin his hands for some time.

Malik said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"If the man's right of inheritance is established, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso has a right of preemption.

A man only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttakes his right by inheritance which has been established\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor him. If his situation differs from this, because the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsale transaction is recent and he sees that the seller\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas concealed the price in order to sever his right of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpre-emption, the value of the land is estimated, and he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbuys the land for that price by his right of pre-emption.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen the buildings, plants, or structures which are extra\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the land are looked at, so he is in the position of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome one who bought the land for a known price, and then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter that built on it and planted. The owner of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpre-emption takes possession after that is included.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"Pre-emption is applied to the property of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe deceased as it is applied to the property of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tliving.

When a woman brings somebody who witnesses that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther husband has divorced her, the husband is made to take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan oath that he has not divorced her. If he takes the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toath, the divorce does not proceed . \"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"There is only one sunna of bringing a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twitness in cases of divorce and freeing a slave. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright to make an oath only belongs to the husband of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twoman, and the master of the slave. Freeing is a hadd\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter, and the testimony of women is not permitted in it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause when a slave is freed, his inviolability is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffirmed and the hadd punishments are applied for and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst him. If he commits fornication and he is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmuhsan, he is stoned. If he kills a slave, he is killed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor it. Inheritance is established for him, between him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand whoever inherits from him. If somebody disputes this,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\targuing that if a man frees his slave and then a man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomes to demand from the master of the slave payment of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdebt, and a man and two women testify to his right, that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablishes the right against the master of the slave so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat his freeing him is cancelled if he only has the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave as property, inferring by this case that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttestimony of women is permitted in cases of setting free.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe case is not as he suggests (i.e. it is a case of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty not freeing). It is like a man who frees his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave, and then the claimant of a debt comes to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaster and takes an oath with one witness, demanding his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright. By that, the freeing of the slave would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcancelled. Or else a man comes who has frequent dealings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand transactions with the master of the slave. He claims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he is owed money by the master of the slave. Someone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsays to the master of the slave, 'Take an oath that you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdon't owe what he claims'. If he draws back and refuses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto take an oath, the one making the claim takes an oath\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand his right against the master of the slave is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfirmed. That would cancel the freeing of the slave if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is confirmed that property is owed by the master.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"It is the same case with a man who marries a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave-girl and then the master of the slave-girl comes to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe man who has married her and claims, 'You and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso-and-so have bought my slave-girl from me for such an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamount of dinars. The husband of the slave-girl denies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat. The master of the slave-girl brings a man and two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen and they testify to what he has said. The sale is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfirmed and his claim is considered true. So the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave-girl is haram for her husband and they have to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseparate, even though the testimony of women is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccepted in divorce.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"It is also the same case with a man who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccuses a free man, so the hadd falls on him. A man and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo women come and testify that the one accused is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave. That would remove the hadd from the accused after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit had befallen him, even though the testimony of women\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis not accepted in accusations involving hadd\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunishments.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"Another similar case in which judgement\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappears to go against the precedent of the sunna is that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo women testify that a child is born alive and so it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary for him to inherit if a situation arises where\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the is entitled to inherit, and the child's property goes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto those who inherit from him, if he dies, and it is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary that the two women witnesses should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccompanied by a man or an oath even though it may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvolve vast properties of gold, silver, live-stock,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgardens and slaves and other properties.

If he swears, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclaim against him is dropped. If he refuses to take an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toath, the claimant is made to take an oath that his claim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis true, and his right against his companion is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablished. There is no dispute about this with any of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people nor in any country. By what does he take this?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn what place in the Book of Allah does he find it? So if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the confirms this, let him confirm the oath with one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twitness, even if it is not in the Book of Allah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMighty, the Majestic! It is enough that this is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprecedent of the sunna. However, man wants to recognise\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe proper course of action and the location of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproof.

If the slave were to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfulfil what he had agreed on to free half of himself, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen the one who had given a kitaba for half of him was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot obliged to complete his setting free, that would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin opposition to the words of the Messenger of Allah, may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah bless him and grant him peace. 'If someone frees\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this share in a slave and has enough money to cover the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfull price of the slave, justly evaluated for him, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmust give his partners their shares, so the slave is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompletely free . ' \"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"If he is not aware of that until the mukatab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas met the terms or before he has met them the owner who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas written him the kitaba returns what he has taken from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mukatab to him, and then he and his partner divide\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim according to their original shares and the kitaba is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvalid. He is the slave of both of them in his original\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik spoke about a mukatab who was owned by two men and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone of them granted him a delay in the payment of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright which he was owed, and the other refused to defer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit, and so the one who refused to defer the payment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texacted his part of the due. Malik said that if the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmukatab then died and left property which did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplete his kitaba, \"They divide it according to what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey are still owed by him. Each of them takes according\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto his share. If the mukatab leaves more than his kitaba,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teach of them takes what remains to them of the kitaba,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand what remains after that is divided equally between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem. If the mukatab is unable to pay his kitaba fully\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the one who did not allow him to defer his payment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas exacted more than his associate did, the slave is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstill divided equally between them, and he does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn to his associates the excess of what he has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texacted, because he only exacted his right with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermission of his associate. If one of them remits what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis owed to him and then his associate exacts part of what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the is owed by him and then the mukatab is unable to pay,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the belongs to both of them. And the one who has exacted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething does not return anything because he only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemanded what he was owed. That is like the debt of two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen in one writing against one man. One of them grants\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim time to pay and the other is greedy and exacts his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdue. Then the debtor goes bankrupt. The one who exacted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this due does not have to return any of what he took.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

This is not part of the sunna\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the muslims. That is because when a man assumes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponsibility to the master of a mukatab for what the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmukatab owes of his kitaba, and then the master of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmukatab pursues that from the one who assumes the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponsibility, he takes his money falsely. It is not as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif he is buying the mukatab, so that what he gives is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpart of the price of something that is his, and neither\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the mukatab being freed so that the price established\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor him buys his inviolability as a free man. If the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmukatab is unable to meet the payments he reverts to his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaster and is his slave. That is because kitaba is not a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfixed debt which can be assumed by the master of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmukatab. It is something which, when it is paid by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmukatab, sets him free. If the mukatab dies and has a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdebt, his master is not one of the creditors for what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremains unpaid of the kitaba. The creditors have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprecedence over the master. If the mukatab cannot meet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe payments, and he owes debts to people, he reverts to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing a slave owned by his master and the debts to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople are the liability of the mukatab. The creditors do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot enter with the master into any share of the price of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this person.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"When people are written together in one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkitaba and there is no kinship between them by which they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinherit from each other, and some of them are responsible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor others, then none of them are freed before the others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuntil all the kitaba has been paid.

The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcess of the property goes to the master, and none of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who have been written in the kitaba with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeceased have any of the excess. The master's claims are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tovershadowed by their claims for the portions which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremain against them of the kitaba which can be fulfilled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the property of the deceased, because the deceased\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad assumed their responsibility and they must use his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty to pay for their freedom.

Then the one who retained\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossession of the slave demanded the like of that for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich his partner had settled or more than that and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmukatab could not pay it. He said, \"The mukatab is shared\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween them because the man has only demanded what is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towed to him.

If he refuses to return\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit, the one who retained possession has the portion of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe share for which his partner made a settlement with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mukatab.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"The explanation of that is that the slave is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivided in two halves between them.

That is a fourth of all the slave. Then the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmukatab is unable to continue, so it is said to the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho settled with him, 'If you wish, return to your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpartner half of what you were awarded and the slave is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivided equally between you.'

The creditors begin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"A mukatab cannot break with his master when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the owes debts to people. He would be set free and have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnothing because the people who hold the debts are more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentitled to his property than his master. That is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermitted for him.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"According to the way things are done among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tus, there is no harm if a man gives a kitaba to his slave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand settles with him for gold and reduces what he is owed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the kitaba provided that only the gold is paid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timmediately. Whoever disapproves of that does so because\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the puts it in the category of a debt which a man has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst another man for a set term. He gives him a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treduction and he pays it immediately. This is not like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat debt. The breaking of the mukatab with his master is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdependent on his giving money to speed up the setting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfree. Inheritance, testimony and the hudud are obliged\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor him and the inviolability of being set free is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablished for him. He is not buying dirhams for dirhams\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor gold for gold. Rather it is like a man who having said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto his slave, 'Bring me such-and-such an amount of dinars\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand you are free', then reduces that for him, saying, 'If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou bring me less than that, you are free.' That is not a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfixed debt. Had it been a fixed debt, the master would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave shared with the creditors of the mukatab when he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdied or went bankrupt. His claim on the property of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmukatab would join theirs.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

They were paid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor and set free because their father did not forbid her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsale if he feared that he would be unable to complete his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkitaba. If her price would not pay for them and neither\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshe nor they could work, they all reverted to being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslaves of the master.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"What is done among us in the case of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson who buys the kitaba of a mukatab, and then the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmukatab dies before he has paid his kitaba, is that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson who bought the kitaba inherits from him. If,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trather than dying, the mukatab cannot pay, the buyer has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this person. If the mukatab pays his kitaba to the person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho bought him and he is freed, his wala' goes to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson who wrote the kitaba and the person who bought his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkitaba does not have any of it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

If the mukatab cannot pay, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis a slave of the people with bequests and does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn to the heirs because they gave him up when they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade their choice, and because when he was surrendered to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people with bequests, they were liable. If he died,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey would not have anything against the heirs. If the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmukatab dies before he pays his kitaba and he leaves\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty which is more than what he owes, his property\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoes to the people with bequests. If the mukatab pays\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat he owes, he is free and his wala' returns to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpaternal relations of the one who wrote the kitaba for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik spoke about a mukatab who owed his master ten\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthousand dirhams in his kitaba, and when he died he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremitted one thousand dirhams from it. He said, \"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmukatab is valued and his value is taken into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsideration. If his value is one thousand dirhams and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe reduction is a tenth of the kitaba, that portion of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe slave's price is one hundred dirhams. It is a tenth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the price. A tenth of the kitaba is therefore reduced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor him. That is converted to a tenth of the price in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcash. That is as if he had had all of what he owed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treduced for him. Had he done that, only the value of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave - one thousand dirhams - would have been taken into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccount in the third of the property of the deceased. If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat which he had remitted is half of the kitaba, half\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe price is taken into account in the third of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty of the deceased. If it is more or less than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat, it is according to this reckoning.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"When a man reduces the kitaba of his mukatab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby one thousand dirhams at his death from a kitaba of ten\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthousand dirhams, and he does not stipulate whether it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the beginning or the end of his kitaba, each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstalment is reduced for him by one tenth.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"If a man remits one thousand dirhams from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this mukatab at his death from the beginning or end of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkitaba, and the original basis of the kitaba is three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthousand dirhams, the mukatab's cash value is estimated.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen that value is divided. That thousand which is from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe beginning of the kitaba is converted into its portion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the price according to its proximity to the term and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits precedence and then the thousand which follows the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst thousand is according to its precedence also until\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit comes to its end, and every thousand is paid according\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto its place in advancing and deferring the term because\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat is deferred of that is less in respect of its price.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen it is placed in the third of the deceased according\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto whatever of the price befalls that thousand according\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the difference in preference of that, whether it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore or less, then it is according to this reckoning.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik spoke about a man who willed a man a fourth of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmukatab or freed a fourth, and then the man died and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmukatab died and left a lot of property, more than he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towed. He said, \"The heirs of the first master and the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho was willed a fourth of the mukatab are given what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey are still owed by the mukatab. Then they divide what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis left over, and the one willed a fourth has a third of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat is left after the kitaba is paid. The heirs of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaster gets two-thirds. That is because the mukatab is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave as long as any of his kitaba remains to be paid. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis inherited from by the possession of his person.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said about a mukatab whose master freed him at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath, \"If the third of the deceased will not cover him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the is freed from it according to what the third will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcover and his kitaba is decreased according to that. If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mukatab owed five thousand dirhams and his value is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo thousand dirhams cash, and the third of the deceased\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis one thousand dirhams, half of him is freed and half of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe kitaba has been reduced for him.\" Malik said about a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman who said in his will, \"My slave so-and-so is free and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrite a kitaba for so-and-so\", that the setting free had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpriority over the kitaba.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

He is made to serve the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinjured person and recompense (in the form of service) is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken from him as the blood-money of the injury. If he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompletes that before his master dies, he reverts to his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaster.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"The generally agreed on way of doing things\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin our community about a mudabbar who does an injury and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen his master dies and the master has no property\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcept him is that the third (allowed to be bequeathed)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis freed, and then the blood-money for the in jury is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivided into thirds. A third of the blood-money is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst the third of him which was set free, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo-thirds are against the two-thirds which the heirs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave. If they wish, they surrender what they have of him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the party with the injury, and if they wish, they give\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe injured person two-thirds of the blood-money and keep\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir portion of the slave. That is because that injury\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis a criminal action by the slave and it is not a debt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst the master by which whatever setting free and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttadbir the master had done would be abrogated. If there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere a debt to people held against the master of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave, as well as the criminal action of the slave, part\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the mudabbar would be sold in proportion to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblood-money of the injury and according to the debt.

Then the debt of his master would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe paid, and then one would look at what remained after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat of the slave. His third would b be set free, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo-thirds of him would belong to the heirs. That is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause the criminal action of the slave is more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant than the debt of his master. That is because,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif the man dies and leaves a mudabbar slave whose value\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis one hundred and fifty dinars, and the slave strikes a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfree man on the head with a blow that lays open the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tskull, and the blood-money is fifty dinars, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaster of the slave has a debt of fifty dinars, one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegins with the fifty dinars which are the blood-money of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe head wound, and it is paid from the price of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave. Then the debt of the master is paid. Then one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlooks at what remains of the slave, and a third of him is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tset free and two-thirds of him remain for the heirs. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblood-money is more pressing against his person than the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdebt of his master. The debt of his master is more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpressing than the tadbir which is a bequest from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthird of the property of the deceased. None of the tadbir\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis permitted while the master of the mudabbar has a debt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich is not paid. It is a bequest.

If there is enough to pay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit, the injured party is paid in full for the blood-money\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his injury and the mudabbar is returned to his master.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf there is not enough to pay it, he takes it from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblood-money and uses the mudabbar for what remains of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblood-money.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

Muawiya wrote to him to kill him in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tretaliation for the dead man.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYahya said that Malik said, \"The best of what I have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theard on the interpretation of this ayat, the word of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, the Blessed, the Exalted, 'The free man for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfree man and the slave for the slave - these are men and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe woman for the woman,' (Sura 2 ayat 178) is that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tretaliation is between women as it is between men. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfree woman is killed for the free woman as the free man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis killed for the free man.

(Sura 5 ayat 48) Allah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBlessed, the Exalted, mentioned that it is a life for a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife. It is the life of a free woman for the life of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfree man, and her injury for his injury.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said about a man who held a man fast for another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman to hit, and he died on the spot, \"If he held him and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the thought that he meant to kill him, the two of them are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboth killed for him.

When the murderer dies, the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseeking blood-revenge has nothing of blood-money or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything else. That is by the word of Allah, the Blessed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Exalted, 'Retaliation is written for you in killing.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe free man for the free man and the slave for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave.' \"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"He only has retaliation against the one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkilled him.

I went to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace, and found that a man was asking for something, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace, was saying, 'I do not have anything to give you.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe man turned away from him in anger, saying, 'By my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife! You give to whomever you wish.' The Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis angry with me because I do not have anything to give\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim.

So I returned and did\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot ask him for anything, and the Messenger of Allah, may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah bless him and grant him peace, sent me barley and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\traisins after that.
