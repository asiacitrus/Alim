And some people of Iraq said, \"A judge can pass a\\n\\t\\t\\tjudgement according to what he hears or witnesses (the litigant's\\n\\t\\t\\tconfession) in the court itself, but if the confession takes\\n\\t\\t\\tplace outside the court, he should not pass the judgment unless\\n\\t\\t\\ttwo witnesses witness the confession.\" Some of them said, \"A\\n\\t\\t\\tjudge can pass a judgement depending on his knowledge of the case\\n\\t\\t\\tas he is trust-worthy, and that a witness is required just to\\n\\t\\t\\treveal the truth. The judge's knowledge is more than the\\n\\t\\t\\twitness.\" Some said, \"A judge can judge according to his\\n\\t\\t\\tknowledge only in cases involving property, but in other cases he\\n\\t\\t\\tcannot.\" Al-Qasim said, \"A judge ought not to pass a judgment\\n\\t\\t\\tdepending on his knowledge if other people do not know what he\\n\\t\\t\\tknows, although his knowledge is more than the witness of\\n\\t\\t\\tsomebody else because he might expose himself to suspicion by the\\n\\t\\t\\tMuslims and cause the Muslims to have unreasonable doubt.\"\\n\\t\\t</p>"

The\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet met Adam over the nearest Heaven.

O\\n\\t\\t\\twhat a good son you are!\" Behold, he saw two flowing rivers,\\n\\t\\t\\twhile he was in the nearest sky.

He asked, \"What is this, O Gabriel?\"\\n\\t\\t\\tGabriel said, \"This is the Kauthar which your Lord has kept for\\n\\t\\t\\tyou.\" Then Gabriel ascended (with him) to the second Heaven and\\n\\t\\t\\tthe angels asked the same questions as those on the first Heaven,\\n\\t\\t\\ti.e., \"Who is it?\" Gabriel replied, \"Gabriel.\" They asked, \"Who\\n\\t\\t\\tis accompanying you?\" He said, \"Muhammad.\" They asked, \"Has he\\n\\t\\t\\tbeen sent for?\" He said, \"Yes.\" Then they said, \"He is welcomed.)\\n\\t\\t\\tThen he (Gabriel) ascended with the Prophet to the third Heaven,\\n\\t\\t\\tand the angels said the same as the angels of the first and the\\n\\t\\t\\tsecond Heavens had said. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen he ascended with him to the fourth Heaven and they said the\\n\\t\\t\\tsame; and then he ascended with him to the fifth Heaven and they\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid the same; and then he ascended with him to the sixth Heaven\\n\\t\\t\\tand they said the same; then he ascended with him to the seventh\\n\\t\\t\\tHeaven and they said the same.

Among the things which\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah revealed to him then, was: \"Fifty prayers were enjoined on\\n\\t\\t\\this followers in a day and a night.\" \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen the Prophet descended till he met Moses, and then Moses\\n\\t\\t\\tstopped him and asked, \"O Muhammad!
