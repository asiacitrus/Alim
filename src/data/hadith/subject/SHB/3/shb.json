When\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims were persecuted, Abu Bakr set out for Ethiopia as an\\n\\t\\t\\temigrant.

Do you turn out a man who helps the poor earn their living,\\n\\t\\t\\tkeeps good relations with kith and kin, helps the disabled,\\n\\t\\t\\tprovides guests with food and shelter, and helps the people\\n\\t\\t\\tduring their troubles?\" \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tSo, Quraish allowed Ibn Ad-Daghna's guarantee of protection and\\n\\t\\t\\ttold Abu- Bakr that he was secure, and said to Ibn Ad-Daghna,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"Advise Abu Bakr to worship his Lord in his house and to pray and\\n\\t\\t\\tread what he liked and not to hurt us and not to do these things\\n\\t\\t\\tpublicly, for we fear that our sons and women may follow him.\"\\n\\t\\t\\tIbn Ad-Daghna told Abu Bakr of all that, so Abu- Bakr continued\\n\\t\\t\\tworshipping his Lord in his house and did not pray or recite\\n\\t\\t\\tQur'an aloud except in his house. Later on Abu Bakr had an idea\\n\\t\\t\\tof building a mosque in the court yard of his house. He fulfilled\\n\\t\\t\\tthat idea and started praying and reciting Qur'an there publicly.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe women and the offspring of the pagans started gathering\\n\\t\\t\\taround him and looking at him astonishingly. Abu Bakr was a\\n\\t\\t\\tsofthearted person and could not help weeping while reciting\\n\\t\\t\\tQur'an. This horrified the pagan chiefs of Quraish. They sent for\\n\\t\\t\\tIbn Ad-Daghna and when he came, they said, \"We have given Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tBakr protection on condition that he will worship his Lord in his\\n\\t\\t\\thouse, but he has transgressed that condition and has built a\\n\\t\\t\\tmosque in the court yard of his house and offered his prayer and\\n\\t\\t\\trecited Qur'an in public. We are afraid lest he mislead our women\\n\\t\\t\\tand offspring. So, go to him and tell him that if he wishes he\\n\\t\\t\\tcan worship his Lord in his house only, and if not, then tell him\\n\\t\\t\\tto return your pledge of protection as we do not like to betray\\n\\t\\t\\tyou by revoking your pledge, nor can we tolerate Abu Bakr's\\n\\t\\t\\tpublic declaration of Islam (his worshipping).\"\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t'Aisha added: Ibn Ad-Daghna came to Abu Bakr and said, \"You know\\n\\t\\t\\tthe conditions on which I gave you protection, so you should\\n\\t\\t\\teither abide by those conditions or revoke my protection, as I do\\n\\t\\t\\tnot like to hear the 'Arabs saying that Ibn Ad-Daghna gave the\\n\\t\\t\\tpledge of protection to a person and his people did not respect\\n\\t\\t\\tit.\" Abu Bakr said, \"I revoke your pledge of protection and am\\n\\t\\t\\tsatisfied with Allah's protection.\" At that time Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\twas still in Mecca and he said to his companions, \"Your place of\\n\\t\\t\\temigration has been shown to me. I have seen salty land, planted\\n\\t\\t\\twith date-palms and situated between two mountains which are the\\n\\t\\t\\ttwo Harras.\" So, when the Prophet told it, some of the companions\\n\\t\\t\\tmigrated to Medina, and some of those who had migrated to\\n\\t\\t\\tEthiopia returned to Medina. When Abu Bakr prepared for\\n\\t\\t\\temigration, Allah's Apostle said to him, \"Wait, for I expect to\\n\\t\\t\\tbe permitted to emigrate.\" Abu Bakr asked, \"May my father be\\n\\t\\t\\tsacrificed for your sake, do you really expect that?\" Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle replied in the affirmative. So, Abu Bakr postponed his\\n\\t\\t\\tdeparture in order to accompany Allah's Apostle and fed two\\n\\t\\t\\tcamels which he had, with the leaves of Samor trees for four\\n\\t\\t\\tmonths.\\n\\t\\t</p>"

He\\n\\t\\t\\tused to go one day, and I another day. When I went I would bring\\n\\t\\t\\thim the news of what had happened that day regarding the\\n\\t\\t\\tinstructions and orders and when he went, he used to do the same\\n\\t\\t\\tfor me. We, the people of Quraish, used to have authority over\\n\\t\\t\\twomen, but when we came to live with the Ansar, we noticed that\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Ansari women had the upper hand over their men, so our women\\n\\t\\t\\tstarted acquiring the habits of the Ansari women.

By Allah, the wives of the Prophet retort upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim, and some of them may not speak with him for the whole day\\n\\t\\t\\ttill night.' What she said scared me and I said to her, 'Whoever\\n\\t\\t\\tamongst them does so, will be a great loser.' Then I dressed\\n\\t\\t\\tmyself and went to Hafsa and asked her, 'Does any of you keep\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle angry all the day long till night?' She replied\\n\\t\\t\\tin the affirmative. I said, 'She is a ruined losing person (and\\n\\t\\t\\twill never have success)! Doesn't she fear that Allah may get\\n\\t\\t\\tangry for the anger of Allah's Apostle and thus she will be\\n\\t\\t\\truined? Don't ask Allah's Apostle too many things, and don't\\n\\t\\t\\tretort upon him in any case, and don't desert him. Demand from me\\n\\t\\t\\twhatever you like, and don't be tempted to imitate your neighbor\\n\\t\\t\\t(i.e. 'Aisha) in her behavior towards the Prophet), for she (i.e.\\n\\t\\t\\tAisha) is more beautiful than you, and more beloved to Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle.' \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tIn those days it was rumored that Ghassan, (a tribe living in\\n\\t\\t\\tSham) was getting prepared their horses to invade us. My\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanion went (to the Prophet) on the day of his turn, went and\\n\\t\\t\\treturned to us at night and knocked at my door violently, asking\\n\\t\\t\\twhether I was sleeping. I was scared (by the hard knocking) and\\n\\t\\t\\tcame out to him. He said that a great thing had happened. I asked\\n\\t\\t\\thim: 'What is it? Have Ghassan come?' He replied that it was\\n\\t\\t\\tworse and more serious than that, and added that Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\thad divorced all his wives. I said, 'Hafsa is a ruined loser! I\\n\\t\\t\\texpected that would happen some day.' So I dressed myself and\\n\\t\\t\\toffered the Fajr prayer with the Prophet. Then the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\tentered an upper room and stayed there alone. I went to Hafsa and\\n\\t\\t\\tfound her weeping. I asked her, 'Why are you weeping? Didn't I\\n\\t\\t\\twarn you? Has Allah's Apostle divorced you all?' She replied, 'I\\n\\t\\t\\tdon't know. He is there in the upper room.' I then went out and\\n\\t\\t\\tcame to the pulpit and found a group of people around it and some\\n\\t\\t\\tof them were weeping. Then I sat with them for some time, but\\n\\t\\t\\tcould not endure the situation. So I went to the upper room where\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet was and requested to a black slave of his: 'Will you\\n\\t\\t\\tget the permission of (Allah's Apostle) for Umar (to enter)?' The\\n\\t\\t\\tslave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and came out\\n\\t\\t\\tsaying, 'I mentioned you to him but he did not reply.' So, I went\\n\\t\\t\\tand sat with the people who were sitting by the pulpit, but I\\n\\t\\t\\tcould not bear the situation, so I went to  the slave again and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: 'Will you get  he permission for Umar?'

So, I entered upon the Prophet and saw him lying on\\n\\t\\t\\ta mat without wedding on it, and the mat had left its mark on the\\n\\t\\t\\tbody of the Prophet, and he was leaning on a leather pillow\\n\\t\\t\\tstuffed with palm fires. I greeted him and while still standing,\\n\\t\\t\\tI said: 'Have you divorced your wives?' He raised his eyes to me\\n\\t\\t\\tand replied in the negative. And then while still standing, I\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid chatting: 'Will you heed what I say, 'O Allah's Apostle! We,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our women\\n\\t\\t\\t(wives), and when we came to the people whose women had the upper\\n\\t\\t\\thand over them...' \" \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t'Umar told the whole story (about his wife). On that the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\tsmiled. 'Umar further said, \"I then said, 'I went to Hafsa and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid to her: Do not be tempted to imitate your companion ('Aisha)\\n\\t\\t\\tfor she is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet.' The Prophet smiled again. When I saw him smiling, I sat\\n\\t\\t\\tdown and cast a glance at the room, and by Allah, I couldn't see\\n\\t\\t\\tanything of importance but three hides. I said (to Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle) 'Invoke Allah to make your followers prosperous for the\\n\\t\\t\\tPersians and the Byzantines have been made prosperous and given\\n\\t\\t\\tworldly luxuries, though they do not worship Allah.' The Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\twas leaning then (and on hearing my speech he sat straight) and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'O Ibn Al-Khattab! Do you have any doubt (that the\\n\\t\\t\\tHereafter is better than this world)? These people have been\\n\\t\\t\\tgiven rewards of their good deeds in this world only.' I asked\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet, 'Please ask Allah's forgiveness for me.' \" The\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet did not go to his wives because of the secret which Hafsa\\n\\t\\t\\thad disclosed to 'Aisha, and he said that he would not go to his\\n\\t\\t\\twives for one month as he was angry with them when Allah\\n\\t\\t\\tadmonished him (for his oath that he would not approach Maria).\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen twenty-nine days had passed, the Prophet went to 'Aisha\\n\\t\\t\\tfirst of all. She said to him, \"You took an oath that you would\\n\\t\\t\\tnot come to us for one month, and today only twenty-nine days\\n\\t\\t\\thave passed, as I have been counting them day by day.\" The\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet said, \"The month is also of twenty-nine days.\" That month\\n\\t\\t\\tconsisted of twenty-nine days. 'Aisha said, \"When the Divine\\n\\t\\t\\trevelation of choice was revealed, the Prophet started with me,\\n\\t\\t\\tsaying to me, 'I am telling you something, but you need not hurry\\n\\t\\t\\tto give the reply till you can consult your parents.' \"  'Aisha\\n\\t\\t\\tknew that her parents would not advise her to part with the\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet. The Prophet said that Allah had said:  \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\"O Prophet! Say To your wives; If you desire The life of this\\n\\t\\t\\tworld And its glitter, ... then come! I will make a provision for\\n\\t\\t\\tyou and set you free In a handsome manner. But if you seek Allah\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd His Apostle, and The Home of the Hereafter, then Verily,\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah has prepared For the good-doers amongst you A great\\n\\t\\t\\treward.\" (33.28) 'Aisha said, \"Am I to consult my parents about\\n\\t\\t\\tthis? I indeed prefer Allah, His Apostle, and the Home of the\\n\\t\\t\\tHereafter.\" After that the Prophet gave the choice to his other\\n\\t\\t\\twives and they also gave the same reply as 'Aisha did.\\n\\t\\t</p>"

During a Ghazwa of\\n\\t\\t\\this, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I\\n\\t\\t\\tproceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by\\n\\t\\t\\twomen. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted\\n\\t\\t\\twhile still in it. When Allah's Apostle was through with his\\n\\t\\t\\tGhazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina,\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of\\n\\t\\t\\tsetting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to\\n\\t\\t\\tanswer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the\\n\\t\\t\\tcamp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my\\n\\t\\t\\tnecklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it\\n\\t\\t\\tand was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me\\n\\t\\t\\ton the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the\\n\\t\\t\\tcamel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were\\n\\t\\t\\tlight in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much.\\n\\t\\t\\tSo, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At\\n\\t\\t\\tthat time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and\\n\\t\\t\\tproceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and\\n\\t\\t\\tcame to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where\\n\\t\\t\\tI used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and\\n\\t\\t\\tcome back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and\\n\\t\\t\\tslept.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tSafwan bin Mu'attal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army\\n\\t\\t\\tand reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping\\n\\t\\t\\tperson, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So,\\n\\t\\t\\tI got up when I heard him saying, 'Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi\\n\\t\\t\\trajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).' He made\\n\\t\\t\\this camel kneel down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg\\n\\t\\t\\ton the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it.\\n\\t\\t\\tSafwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we\\n\\t\\t\\treached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then\\n\\t\\t\\twhoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers\\n\\t\\t\\twas 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to\\n\\t\\t\\tMedina, and I became ill for one month while the people were\\n\\t\\t\\tspreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was\\n\\t\\t\\tfeeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual\\n\\t\\t\\tkindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I\\n\\t\\t\\tgot sick. But he would come, greet and say, 'How is that (girl)?'\\n\\t\\t\\tI did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where\\n\\t\\t\\twe used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to\\n\\t\\t\\tanswer the call of nature except from night to night and that was\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of\\n\\t\\t\\tours was similar to the habit of the old 'Arabs in the open\\n\\t\\t\\tcountry (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went\\n\\t\\t\\tout walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on\\n\\t\\t\\tthat she said, 'Let Mistah be ruined.' I said, 'You are saying a\\n\\t\\t\\tbad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle\\n\\t\\t\\tof) Badr?' She said, 'O Hanata (you there) didn't you hear what\\n\\t\\t\\tthey said?' Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tMy sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle came to me, and after greeting he said, 'How is that\\n\\t\\t\\t(girl)?' I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I\\n\\t\\t\\twanted then to be sure of the news through them. Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\tallowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, 'What\\n\\t\\t\\tare the people talking about?' She said, 'O my daughter! Don't\\n\\t\\t\\tworry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming\\n\\t\\t\\twoman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women\\n\\t\\t\\twould forge false news about her.' I said, 'Glorified be Allah!\\n\\t\\t\\tAre the people really taking of this matter?' That night I kept\\n\\t\\t\\ton weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle called Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when\\n\\t\\t\\the saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consult them about\\n\\t\\t\\tdivorcing his wife (i.e. 'Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he\\n\\t\\t\\tknew of the good reputation of his wives and added, 'O Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her\\n\\t\\t\\tbut good.' 'Ali bin Abu Talib said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\tnot imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other\\n\\t\\t\\tthan she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the\\n\\t\\t\\ttruth.' On that Allah's Apostle called Buraira and said, 'O\\n\\t\\t\\tBuraira. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions\\n\\t\\t\\tabout her?' Buraira said, 'No, by Allah Who has sent you with the\\n\\t\\t\\tTruth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she\\n\\t\\t\\tis a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the\\n\\t\\t\\tdough for the goats to eat.' On that day Allah's Apostle ascended\\n\\t\\t\\tthe pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing\\n\\t\\t\\t'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allah's Apostle said, 'Who will\\n\\t\\t\\tsupport me to punish that person ('Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul)\\n\\t\\t\\twho has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have\\n\\t\\t\\taccused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he\\n\\t\\t\\tnever entered my house except in my company.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tSad bin Mu'adh got up and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! by Allah, I\\n\\t\\t\\twill relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the\\n\\t\\t\\tAus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our\\n\\t\\t\\tbrothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your\\n\\t\\t\\torder.' On that Sad bin 'Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated\\n\\t\\t\\tby his zeal for his tribe and said, 'By Allah, you have told a\\n\\t\\t\\tlie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill\\n\\t\\t\\thim.' On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sad bin\\n\\t\\t\\t'Ubada), 'By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him;\\n\\t\\t\\tand you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites.' On this the\\n\\t\\t\\ttwo tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight\\n\\t\\t\\teach other, while Allah's Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He\\n\\t\\t\\tgot down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept\\n\\t\\t\\tquiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did\\n\\t\\t\\tmy tears stop, nor could I sleep.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tIn the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two\\n\\t\\t\\tnights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from\\n\\t\\t\\tweeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an\\n\\t\\t\\tAnsari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to\\n\\t\\t\\tcome in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were\\n\\t\\t\\tin this state, Allah's Apostle came and sat down and he had never\\n\\t\\t\\tsat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No\\n\\t\\t\\trevelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited\\n\\t\\t\\tTashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah\\n\\t\\t\\tand Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, 'O 'Aisha! I have\\n\\t\\t\\tbeen informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed\\n\\t\\t\\ta sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when\\n\\t\\t\\ta person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah\\n\\t\\t\\taccepts his repentance.' When Allah's Apostle finished his speech\\n\\t\\t\\tmy tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single\\n\\t\\t\\tdrop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allah's Apostle on\\n\\t\\t\\tmy behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle.' I said to my mother, 'Talk to Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\ton my behalf.' She said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tI was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Qur'an.\\n\\t\\t\\tI said. 'I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people\\n\\t\\t\\tare saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have\\n\\t\\t\\ttaken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I\\n\\t\\t\\tconfessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I\\n\\t\\t\\tam innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I don't compare my\\n\\t\\t\\tsituation with you except to the situation of Joseph's father\\n\\t\\t\\t(i.e. Jacob) who said, 'So (for me) patience is most fitting\\n\\t\\t\\tagainst that which you assert and it is Allah (alone) whose help\\n\\t\\t\\tcan be sought.' Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I\\n\\t\\t\\tconsidered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\tQur'an. I had hoped that Allah's Apostle might have a dream in\\n\\t\\t\\twhich Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\thad not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine\\n\\t\\t\\tInspiration came to Allah's Apostle. So, there overtook him the\\n\\t\\t\\tsame state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on\\n\\t\\t\\tbeing inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the\\n\\t\\t\\tdrops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a\\n\\t\\t\\t(cold) wintry day. When that state of Allah's Apostle was over,\\n\\t\\t\\the was smiling and the first word he said, 'Aisha! Thank Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\tfor Allah has declared your innocence.' My mother told me to go\\n\\t\\t\\tto Allah's Apostle. I replied, 'By Allah I will not go to him and\\n\\t\\t\\twill not thank but Allah.' So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who\\n\\t\\t\\tspread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen Allah gave the declaration of my innocence, Abu Bakr, who\\n\\t\\t\\tused to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative,\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause of what he said about 'Aisha.' But Allah later revealed:\\n\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not\\n\\t\\t\\tto help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their\\n\\t\\t\\thomes in Allah's cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not\\n\\t\\t\\twish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is\\n\\t\\t\\tOft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\"\\t(24.22) After that Abu Bakr said,\\n\\t\\t\\t'Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me,' and\\n\\t\\t\\tresumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\twife about me saying, 'What do you know and what did you see?'\\n\\t\\t\\tShe replied, 'O Allah's Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or\\n\\t\\t\\tseeing what I have not heard or seen.

He killed them and took their property and came (to\\n\\t\\t\\tMedina) to embrace Islam. The Prophet said (to him, \"As regards\\n\\t\\t\\tyour Islam, I accept it, but as for the property I do not take\\n\\t\\t\\tanything of it. (As it was taken through treason). Urwa then\\n\\t\\t\\tstarted looking at the Companions of the Prophet.

Urwa returned to his people and said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"O people! By Allah, I have been to the kings and to Caesar,\\n\\t\\t\\tKhosrau and An-Najashi, yet I have never seen any of them\\n\\t\\t\\trespected by his courtiers as much as Muhammad is respected by\\n\\t\\t\\this companions.

So, write: \"Muhammad bin\\n\\t\\t\\tAbdullah.\" The Prophet said, \"By Allah! I am Apostle of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\teven if you people do not believe me. Write: Muhammad bin\\n\\t\\t\\tAbdullah.\" (Az-Zuhri said, \"The Prophet accepted all those\\n\\t\\t\\tthings, as he had already said that he would accept everything\\n\\t\\t\\tthey would demand if it respects the ordinance of Allah, (i.e. by\\n\\t\\t\\tletting him and his companions perform 'Umra.)\" The Prophet said\\n\\t\\t\\tto Suhail, \"On the condition that you allow us to visit the House\\n\\t\\t\\t(i.e. Ka'ba) so that we may perform Tawaf around it.\" Suhail\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"By Allah, we will not (allow you this year) so as not to\\n\\t\\t\\tgive chance to the 'Arabs to say that we have yielded to you, but\\n\\t\\t\\twe will allow you next year.\" So, the Prophet got that written. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen Suhail said, \"We also stipulate that you should return to us\\n\\t\\t\\twhoever comes to you from us, even if he embraced your religion.\"\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Muslims said, \"Glorified be Allah! How will such a person be\\n\\t\\t\\treturned to the pagans after he has become a Muslim? While they\\n\\t\\t\\twere in this state Abu-Jandal bin Suhail bin 'Amr came from the\\n\\t\\t\\tvalley of Mecca staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims. Suhail said, \"O Muhammad! This is the very first\\n\\t\\t\\tterm with which we make peace with you, i.e. you shall return Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tJandal to me.\" The Prophet said, \"The peace treaty has not been\\n\\t\\t\\twritten yet.\" Suhail said, \"I will never allow you to keep him.\"\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Prophet said, \"Yes, do.\" He said, \"I won't do.\" Mikraz said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"We allow you (to keep him).\" Abu Jandal said, \"O Muslims! Will I\\n\\t\\t\\tbe returned to the pagans though I have come as a Muslim? Don't\\n\\t\\t\\tyou see how much I have suffered?\" \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAbu Jandal had been tortured severely for the cause of Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\tUmar bin Al-Khattab said, \"I went to the Prophet and said,\\n\\t\\t\\t'Aren't you truly the Apostle of Allah?' The Prophet said, 'Yes,\\n\\t\\t\\tindeed.' I said, 'Isn't our cause just and the cause of the enemy\\n\\t\\t\\tunjust?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Then why should we be humble in\\n\\t\\t\\tour religion?' He said, 'I am Allah's Apostle and I do not\\n\\t\\t\\tdisobey Him, and He will make me victorious.' I said, 'Didn't you\\n\\t\\t\\ttell us that we would go to the Ka'ba and perform Tawaf around\\n\\t\\t\\tit?' He said, 'Yes, but did I tell you that we would visit the\\n\\t\\t\\tKa'ba this year?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'So you will visit it\\n\\t\\t\\tand perform Tawaf around it?' \" Umar further said, \"I went to Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tBakr and said, 'O Abu Bakr! Isn't he truly Allah's Prophet?' He\\n\\t\\t\\treplied, 'Yes.' I said, 'Then why should we be humble in our\\n\\t\\t\\treligion?' He said, 'Indeed, he is Allah's Apostle and he does\\n\\t\\t\\tnot disobey his Lord, and He will make him victorious. Adhere to\\n\\t\\t\\thim as, by Allah, he is on the right.' I said, 'Was he not\\n\\t\\t\\ttelling us that we would go to the Kaba and perform Tawaf around\\n\\t\\t\\tit?' He said, 'Yes, but did he tell you that you would go to the\\n\\t\\t\\tKa'ba this year?' I said, 'No.' He said, \"You will go to Ka'ba\\n\\t\\t\\tand perform Tawaf around it.\" (Az-Zuhri said, \" 'Umar said, 'I\\n\\t\\t\\tperformed many good deeds as  expiation for the improper\\n\\t\\t\\tquestions I asked them.' \") \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen the writing of the peace treaty was concluded, Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle said to his companions, \"Get up and slaughter your\\n\\t\\t\\tsacrifices and get your head shaved.\" By Allah none of them got\\n\\t\\t\\tup, and the Prophet repeated his order thrice. When none of them\\n\\t\\t\\tgot up, he left them and went to Um Salama and told her of the\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople's attitudes towards him. Um Salama said, \"O the Prophet of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah! Do you want your order to be carried out? Go out and don't\\n\\t\\t\\tsay a word to anybody till you have slaughtered your sacrifice\\n\\t\\t\\tand call your barber to shave your head.\" So, the Prophet went\\n\\t\\t\\tout and did not talk to anyone of them till he did that, i.e.\\n\\t\\t\\tslaughtered the sacrifice and called his barber who shaved his\\n\\t\\t\\thead. Seeing that, the companions of the Prophet got up,\\n\\t\\t\\tslaughtered their sacrifices, and started shaving the heads of\\n\\t\\t\\tone another, and there was so much rush that there was a danger\\n\\t\\t\\tof killing each other. Then some believing women came (to the\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet ); and Allah revealed the following Divine verses:--\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\"O you who believe, when the believing women come to you as\\n\\t\\t\\temigrants examine them . . .\" (60.10)\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t'Umar then divorced two wives of his who were infidels. Later on\\n\\t\\t\\tMuawiya bin Abu Sufyan married one of them, and Safwan bin Umaya\\n\\t\\t\\tmarried the other. When the Prophet returned to Medina, Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tBasir, a new Muslim convert from Quraish came to him. The\\n\\t\\t\\tinfidels sent in his pursuit two men who said (to the Prophet ),\\n\\t\\t\\t\"Abide by the promise you gave us.\" So, the Prophet handed him\\n\\t\\t\\tover to them. They took him out (of the City) till they reached\\n\\t\\t\\tDhul-Hulaifa where they dismounted to eat some dates they had\\n\\t\\t\\twith them. Abu Basir said to one of them, \"By Allah, O so-and-so,\\n\\t\\t\\tI see you have a fine sword.\" The other drew it out (of the\\n\\t\\t\\tscabbard) and said, \"By Allah, it is very fine and I have tried\\n\\t\\t\\tit many times.\" Abu Basir said, \"Let me have a look at it.\" \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen the other gave it to him, he hit him with it till he died,\\n\\t\\t\\tand his companion ran away till he came to Medina and entered the\\n\\t\\t\\tmosque running. When Allah's Apostle saw him he said, \"This man\\n\\t\\t\\tappears to have been frightened.\" When he reached the Prophet he\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"My companion has been murdered and I would have been\\n\\t\\t\\tmurdered too.\" Abu Basir came and said, \"O Allah's Apostle, by\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah, Allah has made you fulfill your obligations by your\\n\\t\\t\\treturning me to them (i.e. the infidels), but Allah has saved me\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom them.\" The Prophet said, \"Woe to his mother! what excellent\\n\\t\\t\\twar kindler he would be, should he only have supporters.\" When\\n\\t\\t\\tAbu Basir heard that he understood that the Prophet would return\\n\\t\\t\\thim to them again, so he set off till he reached the seashore.\\n\\t\\t\\tAbu Jandal bin Suhail got himself released from them (i.e.\\n\\t\\t\\tinfidels) and joined Abu Basir. So, whenever a man from Quraish\\n\\t\\t\\tembraced Islam he would follow Abu Basir till they formed a\\n\\t\\t\\tstrong group. By Allah, whenever they heard about a caravan of\\n\\t\\t\\tQuraish heading towards Sham, they stopped it and attacked and\\n\\t\\t\\tkilled them (i.e. infidels) and took their properties. The people\\n\\t\\t\\tof Quraish sent a message to the Prophet requesting him for the\\n\\t\\t\\tsake of Allah and kth and kin to send for (i.e. Abu Basir and his\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanions) promising that whoever (amongst them) came to the\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet would be secure. So the Prophet sent for them (i.e. Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tBasir's companions) and Allah I revealed the following Divine\\n\\t\\t\\tverses:\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\"And it is He Who Has withheld their hands from you and your\\n\\t\\t\\thands From them in the midst of Mecca, After He made you the\\n\\t\\t\\tvictorious over them. . . . the unbelievers had pride and\\n\\t\\t\\thaughtiness, in their hearts . . . the pride and haughtiness of\\n\\t\\t\\tthe time of ignorance.\"  (48.24-26)  And their pride and\\n\\t\\t\\thaughtiness was that they did not confess (write in the treaty)\\n\\t\\t\\tthat he (i.e. Muhammad) was the Prophet of Allah and refused to\\n\\t\\t\\twrite: \"In the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the Most\\n\\t\\t\\tMerciful,\" and prevented the Mushriks from visiting the Ka'ba.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tNarrated Az-Zuhri: Urwa said, \" 'Aisha told me that Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle used to examine the women emigrants. We have been told\\n\\t\\t\\talso that when Allah revealed the order that the Muslims should\\n\\t\\t\\treturn to the pagans what they had spent on their wives who\\n\\t\\t\\temigrated (after embracing Islam) and that the Mushriks should\\n\\t\\t\\tnot keep unbelieving women as their wives, 'Umar divorced two of\\n\\t\\t\\this wives, Qariba, the daughter of Abu Urhaiya and the daughter\\n\\t\\t\\tof Jarwal Al-Khuza'i. Later on Mu'awiya married Qariba and Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tJahm married the other.\"\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen the pagans refused to pay what the Muslims had spent on\\n\\t\\t\\ttheir wives, Allah revealed: \"And if any of your wives have gone\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom you to the unbelievers and you have an accession (by the\\n\\t\\t\\tcoming over of a woman from the other side) (then pay to those\\n\\t\\t\\twhose wives have gone) the equivalent of what they had spent (on\\n\\t\\t\\ttheir mahr).\" (60.11)\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tSo, Allah ordered that the Muslim whose wife has gone, should be\\n\\t\\t\\tgiven, as a compensation of the mahr he had given to his wife,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom the mahr of the wives of the pagans who had emigrated\\n\\t\\t\\tdeserting their husbands.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWe do not know any of the women emigrants who deserted Islam\\n\\t\\t\\tafter embracing it. We have also been told that Abu Basir bin\\n\\t\\t\\tAsid Ath-Thaqafi came to the Prophet as a Muslim emigrant during\\n\\t\\t\\tthe truce.
