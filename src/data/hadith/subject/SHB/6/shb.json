Dihya Al-Kalbi had brought and given it to the\\n\\t\\t\\tgovernor of Busra, and the latter forwarded it to Heraclius.\\n\\t\\t\\tHeraclius said, 'Is there anyone from the people of this man who\\n\\t\\t\\tclaims to be a prophet?' The people replied, 'Yes.' So I along\\n\\t\\t\\twith some of Quraishi men were called and we entered upon\\n\\t\\t\\tHeraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, 'Who\\n\\t\\t\\tamongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims to be a\\n\\t\\t\\tprophet?' So they made me sit in front of him and made my\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanions sit behind me. Then he called upon his translator and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid (to him), 'Tell them ( i.e. Abu Sufyan's companions) that I\\n\\t\\t\\tam going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who\\n\\t\\t\\tclaims to be a prophet. So, if he tell me a lie, they should\\n\\t\\t\\tcontradict him (instantly).' By Allah, had I not been afraid that\\n\\t\\t\\tmy companions would consider me a liar, I would have told lies.\\n\\t\\t\\tHeraclius then said to his translator, 'Ask him: What is his\\n\\t\\t\\t(i.e. the Prophet's) family status amongst you?' I said, 'He\\n\\t\\t\\tbelongs to a noble family amongst us.' Heraclius said, 'Was any\\n\\t\\t\\tof his ancestors a king?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Did you ever\\n\\t\\t\\taccuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?' I\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'No.' He said, 'Do the nobles follow him or the poor\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople?' I said, 'It is the poor who followed him.' He said, 'Is\\n\\t\\t\\tthe number of his followers increasing or decreasing?' I said,\\n\\t\\t\\t'They are increasing.' He said, 'Does anyone renounce his\\n\\t\\t\\treligion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with\\n\\t\\t\\tit?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Did you fight with him?' I replied,\\n\\t\\t\\t'Yes.' He said, 'How was your fighting with him?' I said, 'The\\n\\t\\t\\tfighting between us was undecided and victory was shared by him\\n\\t\\t\\tand us by turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict\\n\\t\\t\\tcasualties upon him.' He said, 'Did he ever betray?' I said, 'No,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut now we are away from him in this truce and we do not know\\n\\t\\t\\twhat he will do in it.' \" Abu Sufyan added, \"By Allah, I was not\\n\\t\\t\\table to insert in my speech a word (against him) except that.\\n\\t\\t\\tHeraclius said, 'Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claim the\\n\\t\\t\\tsame (i.e. Islam) before him? I said, 'No.' Then Heraclius told\\n\\t\\t\\this translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyan), 'I asked you about\\n\\t\\t\\this family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from\\n\\t\\t\\ta noble family amongst you. Verily, all Apostles come from the\\n\\t\\t\\tnoblest family among their people. Then I asked you whether any\\n\\t\\t\\tof his ancestors was a king, and you denied that. Thereupon I\\n\\t\\t\\tthought that had one of his fore-fathers been a king, I would\\n\\t\\t\\thave said that he (i.e. Muhammad) was seeking to rule the kingdom\\n\\t\\t\\tof his fore-fathers. Then I asked you regarding his followers,\\n\\t\\t\\twhether they were the noble or the poor among the people, and you\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid that they were only the poor (who follow him). In fact, such\\n\\t\\t\\tare the followers of the Apostles. Then I asked you whether you\\n\\t\\t\\thave ever accused him of telling lies before saying what he said,\\n\\t\\t\\tand your reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took for granted\\n\\t\\t\\tthat a man who did not tell a lie about others, could ever tell a\\n\\t\\t\\tlie about Allah. Then I asked you whether anyone of his followers\\n\\t\\t\\thad renounced his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being\\n\\t\\t\\tdispleased with it, and you denied that. And such is Faith when\\n\\t\\t\\tit mixes with the cheerfulness of the hearts. Then I asked you\\n\\t\\t\\twhether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You claimed\\n\\t\\t\\tthat they were increasing. That is the way of true faith till it\\n\\t\\t\\tis complete. Then I asked you whether you had ever fought with\\n\\t\\t\\thim, and you claimed that you had fought with him and the battle\\n\\t\\t\\tbetween you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by\\n\\t\\t\\tyou and him in turns; he inflicted casualties upon you and you\\n\\t\\t\\tinflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with the\\n\\t\\t\\tApostles; they are out to test and the final victory is for them.\\n\\t\\t\\tThen I asked you whether he had ever betrayed; you claimed that\\n\\t\\t\\the had never betrayed. Indeed, Apostles never betray. Then I\\n\\t\\t\\tasked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and\\n\\t\\t\\tyou denied that. Thereupon I thought if somebody had said that\\n\\t\\t\\tstatement before him, then I would have said that he was but a\\n\\t\\t\\tman copying some sayings said before him.\" Abu Safyan said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"Heraclius then asked me, 'What does he order you to do?' I said,\\n\\t\\t\\t'He orders us (to offer) prayers and (to pay) Zakat and to keep\\n\\t\\t\\tgood relationship with the kith and kin and to be chaste.' Then\\n\\t\\t\\tHeraclius said, 'If whatever you have said, is true, he is really\\n\\t\\t\\ta prophet, and I knew that he ( i.e. the Prophet ) was going to\\n\\t\\t\\tappear, but I never thought that he would be from amongst you. If\\n\\t\\t\\tI were certain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and\\n\\t\\t\\tif I were with him, I would wash his feet; and his kingdom will\\n\\t\\t\\texpand (surely) to what is under my feet.' Then Heraclius asked\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the letter of Allah's Apostle and read it wherein was\\n\\t\\t\\twritten:\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t'In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.\\n\\t\\t\\t(This letter is) from Muhammad, Apostle of Allah, to Heraclius,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe sovereign of Byzantine...Peace be upon him who follows the\\n\\t\\t\\tRight Path. Now then, I call you to embrace Islam.

Do\\n\\t\\t\\tyou wish to have a permanent success and guidance and that your\\n\\t\\t\\tkingdom should remain with you?' (Immediately after hearing\\n\\t\\t\\tthat), they rushed towards the gate like onagers, but they found\\n\\t\\t\\tthem closed. Heraclius then said, 'Bring them back to me.' So he\\n\\t\\t\\tcalled them and said, 'I just wanted to test the strength of your\\n\\t\\t\\tadherence to your religion. Now I have observed of you that which\\n\\t\\t\\tI like.'

(3.186) And Allah also said:  \"Many\\n\\t\\t\\tof the people of the Scripture wish if they could turn you away\\n\\t\\t\\tas disbelievers after you have believed, from selfish envy...\"\\n\\t\\t\\t(2.109) \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tSo the Prophet used to stick to the principle of forgiveness for\\n\\t\\t\\tthem as long as Allah ordered him to do so till Allah permitted\\n\\t\\t\\tfighting them.

Please intercede for us with your Lord. Don't you see\\n\\t\\t\\tin what state we are?' Jesus will say, 'My Lord has today become\\n\\t\\t\\tangry as He has never become before nor will ever become\\n\\t\\t\\tthereafter. Jesus will not mention any sin, but will say,\\n\\t\\t\\t'Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Muhammad.' So\\n\\t\\t\\tthey will come to me and say, 'O Muhammad ! You are Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle and the last of the prophets, and Allah forgave your\\n\\t\\t\\tearly and late sins. (Please) intercede for us with your Lord.\\n\\t\\t\\tDon't you see in what state we are?' \" The Prophet added, \"Then I\\n\\t\\t\\twill go beneath Allah's Throne and fall in prostration before my\\n\\t\\t\\tLord. And then Allah will guide me to such praises and\\n\\t\\t\\tglorification to Him as He has never guided anybody else before\\n\\t\\t\\tme. Then it will be said, 'O Muhammad! Raise your head. Ask, and\\n\\t\\t\\tit will be granted. Intercede! It (your intercession) will be\\n\\t\\t\\taccepted.' So I will raise my head and say, 'My followers, O my\\n\\t\\t\\tLord! My followers, O my Lord'. It will be said, 'O Muhammad! Let\\n\\t\\t\\tthose of your followers who have no accounts, enter through such\\n\\t\\t\\ta gate of the gates of Paradise as lies on the right; and they\\n\\t\\t\\twill share the other gates with the people.' \" The Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\tfurther said, \"By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the distance\\n\\t\\t\\tbetween every two gate-posts of Paradise is like the distance\\n\\t\\t\\tbetween Mecca and Busra (in Sham).\"\\n\\t\\t</p>"

At that time a bird took with its beak\\n\\t\\t\\t(some water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, 'By Allah, my\\n\\t\\t\\tknowledge and your knowledge besides Allah's Knowledge is like\\n\\t\\t\\twhat this bird has taken with its beak from the sea.' Until, when\\n\\t\\t\\tthey went on board the boat, (18.71) they found a small boat\\n\\t\\t\\twhich used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other\\n\\t\\t\\tsea-side. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and said, 'The pious\\n\\t\\t\\tslave of Allah.' (We said to Said, \"Was that Khadir?\" He said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"Yes.\") The boatmen said, 'We will not get him on board with\\n\\t\\t\\tfare.' Al-Khadir scuttled the boat and then plugged the hole with\\n\\t\\t\\ta piece o wood. Moses said, 'Have you scuttled it in order to\\n\\t\\t\\tdrown these people; surely, you have done a dreadful thing.\\n\\t\\t\\t(18.71) (Mujahid said, \"Moses said so protestingly.\") Al-Khadir\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'Didn't I say that you can have no patience with me?'\\n\\t\\t\\t(18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of\\n\\t\\t\\tforgetfulness, the second caused him to be bound with a\\n\\t\\t\\tstipulation, and the third was done intentionally. Moses said,\\n\\t\\t\\t'Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me\\n\\t\\t\\tfor my affair (with you).'  (18.73)\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t(Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya'la said:\\n\\t\\t\\tSaid said: They found boys playing and Al-Khadir got hold of a\\n\\t\\t\\thandsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife.\\n\\t\\t\\tMoses said, 'Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed\\n\\t\\t\\tnobody?' (18.74) Then they proceeded and found a wall which was\\n\\t\\t\\ton the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight.\\n\\t\\t\\tSaid moved his hand thus and said, Al-Khadir raised his hand and\\n\\t\\t\\tthe wall became straight. Ya'la said, I think Said said,\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight.\\n\\t\\t\\t(Moses said to Al-Khadir), 'If you had wished, you could have\\n\\t\\t\\ttaken wages for it.' Said said, 'Wages that we might have eaten.'\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there was a king in furor (ahead) of them. (18.79)\\tAnd there\\n\\t\\t\\twas in front of them. Ibn 'Abbas recited: 'In front of them (was)\\n\\t\\t\\ta king.' \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tIt is said on the authority of somebody other than Said that the\\n\\t\\t\\tking was Hudad bin Budad. They say that the boy was called\\n\\t\\t\\tHairur. 'A king who seized every ship by force.' (18.79) So I\\n\\t\\t\\twished that if that boat passed by him, he would leave it because\\n\\t\\t\\tof its defect and when they have passed they would repair it and\\n\\t\\t\\tget benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole\\n\\t\\t\\twith a bottle, and some said with tar. 'His parents were\\n\\t\\t\\tbelievers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we (Khadir)\\n\\t\\t\\tfeared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and\\n\\t\\t\\tdisbelief.' (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them\\n\\t\\t\\tto follow him in his religion, 'so we (Khadir) desired that their\\n\\t\\t\\tLord should change him for them for one better in righteousness\\n\\t\\t\\tand near to mercy' (18.81). This was in reply to Moses' saying:\\n\\t\\t\\tYou have killed an innocent soul.' (18.74). 'Near to mercy' means\\n\\t\\t\\tthey will be more merciful to him than they were to the former\\n\\t\\t\\twhom Khadir had killed. Other than Sa'id, said that they were\\n\\t\\t\\tcompensated with a girl. Dawud bin Abi 'Asim said on the\\n\\t\\t\\tauthority of more than one that this next child was a girl.\\n\\t\\t</p>"

Ubai bin Ka'b narrated to us\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Allah's Apostle said, \"Moses got up to deliver a sermon\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore Bani Israel and he was asked, 'Who is the most learned\\n\\t\\t\\tperson among the people?' Moses replied, 'I (am the most\\n\\t\\t\\tlearned).' Allah then admonished Moses for he did not ascribe all\\n\\t\\t\\tknowledge to Allah only. (Then) came the Divine Inspiration:\\n\\t\\t\\t'Yes, one of Our slaves at the junction of the two seas is more\\n\\t\\t\\tlearned than you.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tMoses said, 'O my Lord ! How can meet him?' Allah said, 'Take a\\n\\t\\t\\tfish in a basket and wherever the fish is lost, follow it (you\\n\\t\\t\\twill find him at that place). So Moses set out along with his\\n\\t\\t\\tattendant Yusha' bin Nun, and they carried with them a fish till\\n\\t\\t\\tthey reached a rock and rested there. Moses put his head down and\\n\\t\\t\\tslept. (Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that somebody other than 'Amr\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid:) At the rock there was a water spring called 'Al-Hayat' and\\n\\t\\t\\tnone came in touch with its water but became alive. So some of\\n\\t\\t\\tthe water of that spring fell over that fish, so it moved and\\n\\t\\t\\tslipped out of the basket and entered the sea. When Moses woke\\n\\t\\t\\tup, he asked his attendant, 'Bring our early meal.' (18.62) \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThe narrator added: Moses did not suffer from fatigue except\\n\\t\\t\\tafter he had passed the place he had been ordered to observe. His\\n\\t\\t\\tattendant Yusha bin Nun said to him, 'Do you remember (what\\n\\t\\t\\thappened) when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed\\n\\t\\t\\tforget (about) the fish...' (18.63) The narrator added: So they\\n\\t\\t\\tcame back, retracing their steps and then they found in the sea,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe way of the fish looking like a tunnel. So there was an\\n\\t\\t\\tastonishing event for his attendant, and there was tunnel for the\\n\\t\\t\\tfish. When they reached the rock, they found a man covered with a\\n\\t\\t\\tgarment. Moses greeted him. The man said astonishingly, 'Is there\\n\\t\\t\\tany such greeting in your land?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' The\\n\\t\\t\\tman said, 'Moses of Bani Israel?' Moses said, 'Yes,' and added,\\n\\t\\t\\t'May I follow you so that you teach me something of the Knowledge\\n\\t\\t\\twhich you have been taught?' (18.66)  Al-Khadir said to him, 'O\\n\\t\\t\\tMoses! You have something of Allah's knowledge which Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\ttaught you and which I do not know; and I have something of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's knowledge which Allah has taught me and which you do not\\n\\t\\t\\tknow.' Moses said, 'But I will follow you.' Al-Khadir said, 'Then\\n\\t\\t\\tif you follow me, ask me no question about anything until I\\n\\t\\t\\tmyself speak to you concerning it.'  (18.70). After that both of\\n\\t\\t\\tthem proceeded along the seashore. There passed by them a boat\\n\\t\\t\\twhose crew recognized Al-Khadir and received them on board free\\n\\t\\t\\tof charge. So they both got on board. A sparrow came and sat on\\n\\t\\t\\tthe edge of the boat and dipped its beak into the sea. Al-Khadir\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid to Moses, 'My knowledge and your knowledge and all the\\n\\t\\t\\tcreation's knowledge compared to Allah's knowledge is not more\\n\\t\\t\\tthan the water taken by this sparrow's beak.' \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen Moses was startled by Al-Khadir's action of taking an adze\\n\\t\\t\\tand scuttling the boat with it. Moses said to him, 'These people\\n\\t\\t\\tgave us a free lift, but you intentionally scuttled their boat so\\n\\t\\t\\tas to drown them. Surely you have...'\\t (18.71) Then they both\\n\\t\\t\\tproceeded and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took\\n\\t\\t\\thold of him by the head and cut it off. Moses said to him, 'Have\\n\\t\\t\\tyou killed an innocent soul who has killed nobody? Surely you\\n\\t\\t\\thave done an illegal thing!'  (18.74) He said, 'Didn't I tell you\\n\\t\\t\\tthat you will not be able to have patience with me...(up\\n\\t\\t\\tto)...but they refused to entertain them as their guests. There\\n\\t\\t\\tthey found a wall therein at the point of collapsing.'\\n\\t\\t\\t(18.75-77) Al-Khadir moved his hand thus and set it upright\\n\\t\\t\\t(repaired it). Moses said to him, 'When we entered this town,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey neither gave us hospitality nor fed us; if you had wished,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou could have taken wages for it.' Al-Khadir said, 'This is the\\n\\t\\t\\tparting between you and me I will tell you the interpretation of\\n\\t\\t\\t(those things) about which you were unable to hold patience...'\\n\\t\\t\\t\"(18.78)\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle said, \"We wished that Moses could have been more\\n\\t\\t\\tpatient so that He (Allah) could have described to us more about\\n\\t\\t\\ttheir story.\" Ibn 'Abbas used to recite:   \" 'And in front\\n\\t\\t\\t(ahead) of them there was a king who used to seize every\\n\\t\\t\\t(serviceable) boat by force.'

                "text": "<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allah's Apostle intended to go\\n\\t\\t\\ton a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take\\n\\t\\t\\twith him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots\\n\\t\\t\\twhen he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me.\\n\\t\\t\\tSo I proceeded with Allah's Apostle after Allah's order of\\n\\t\\t\\tveiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in\\n\\t\\t\\tmy howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We\\n\\t\\t\\tcarried on our journey, and when Allah's Apostle had finished his\\n\\t\\t\\tGhazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\tordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume\\n\\t\\t\\tthe homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army\\n\\t\\t\\t(camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went\\n\\t\\t\\ttowards my howdah, but behold! A necklace of mine made of Jaz\\n\\t\\t\\tAzfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and\\n\\t\\t\\tmy search for it detained me. The group of people who used to\\n\\t\\t\\tcarry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel\\n\\t\\t\\ton which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that\\n\\t\\t\\ttime women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used\\n\\t\\t\\tto eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness\\n\\t\\t\\tof the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace\\n\\t\\t\\tafter the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody\\n\\t\\t\\ttherein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking\\n\\t\\t\\tthat they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was\\n\\t\\t\\tsitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Mu'attil As-Sulami Adh-Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had\\n\\t\\t\\tstarted in the last part of the night and reached my stationing\\n\\t\\t\\tplace in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He\\n\\t\\t\\tcame to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Lillahi wa\\n\\t\\t\\tinna ilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I\\n\\t\\t\\tcovered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to\\n\\t\\t\\tme a single word except, \"Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\"\\n\\t\\t\\ttill he made his she-camel kneel down whereupon he trod on its\\n\\t\\t\\tforelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the\\n\\t\\t\\tshe-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they\\n\\t\\t\\twere resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for\\n\\t\\t\\tdestruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk\\n\\t\\t\\t(forged statement) was 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this\\n\\t\\t\\twe arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople were spreading the forged statements of the people of the\\n\\t\\t\\tIfk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my\\n\\t\\t\\tdoubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I\\n\\t\\t\\tfell sick. Allah's Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting\\n\\t\\t\\tand add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThat aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated\\n\\t\\t\\tevil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah\\n\\t\\t\\tto answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where\\n\\t\\t\\twe used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this\\n\\t\\t\\tpurpose except from night to night, and that was before we had\\n\\t\\t\\tlavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was\\n\\t\\t\\tsimilar to the habit of the old 'Arabs (in the deserts or in the\\n\\t\\t\\ttents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered\\n\\t\\t\\tit troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I\\n\\t\\t\\twent out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin Abd\\n\\t\\t\\tManaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the\\n\\t\\t\\taunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back\\n\\t\\t\\ttowards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"Let Mistah be ruined! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word\\n\\t\\t\\tyou have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the\\n\\t\\t\\tBattle of Badr?\" She said, \"O you there! Didn't you hear what he\\n\\t\\t\\thas said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the\\n\\t\\t\\tstatement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added\\n\\t\\t\\tto my ailment. When I returned home, Allah's Apostle came to me,\\n\\t\\t\\tand after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will\\n\\t\\t\\tyou allow me to go to my parents?\" At that time I intended to be\\n\\t\\t\\tsure of the news through them. Allah's Apostle allowed me and I\\n\\t\\t\\twent to my parents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are\\n\\t\\t\\tthe people talking about?\" My mother said, \"O my daughter! Take\\n\\t\\t\\tit easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by\\n\\t\\t\\ther husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives\\n\\t\\t\\twould find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! Did the people\\n\\t\\t\\treally talk about that?\" \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThat night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My\\n\\t\\t\\ttears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I\\n\\t\\t\\twas still weeping, Allah's Apostle called 'Ali bin Abi Talib and\\n\\t\\t\\tUsama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to\\n\\t\\t\\tconsult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid\\n\\t\\t\\ttold Allah's Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his\\n\\t\\t\\twife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her\\n\\t\\t\\texcept good.\" But 'Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allah's Apostle!\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty\\n\\t\\t\\tof women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl,\\n\\t\\t\\tshe will tell you the truth.\" 'Aisha added: So Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\tcalled for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did you ever see anything\\n\\t\\t\\twhich might have aroused your suspicion (as regards 'Aisha).\"\\n\\t\\t\\tBarira said, \"By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have\\n\\t\\t\\tnever seen anything regarding 'Aisha which I would blame her for\\n\\t\\t\\texcept that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps\\n\\t\\t\\tand leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the\\n\\t\\t\\tdomestic goats come and eat it.\" So Allah's Apostle got up (and\\n\\t\\t\\taddressed) the people and asked for somebody who would take\\n\\t\\t\\trevenge on 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allah's Apostle,\\n\\t\\t\\twhile on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who will help me against a\\n\\t\\t\\tman who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know\\n\\t\\t\\tnothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man\\n\\t\\t\\tof whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my\\n\\t\\t\\tfamily except with me.\" Sad bin Muadh Al-Ansari got up and said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"O Allah's Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he\\n\\t\\t\\tbe from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head\\n\\t\\t\\toff; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give\\n\\t\\t\\tus your order and we will obey it.\" On that, Sad bin 'Ubada got\\n\\t\\t\\tup, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident\\n\\t\\t\\the had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his\\n\\t\\t\\ttribe. He said to Sad (bin Muadh), \"By Allah the Eternal, you\\n\\t\\t\\thave told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be\\n\\t\\t\\table to kill him!\" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sad\\n\\t\\t\\t(bin Muadh) got up and said to Sad bin 'Ubada, \"You are a liar!\\n\\t\\t\\tBy Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a\\n\\t\\t\\thypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So the two tribes of Al-Aus\\n\\t\\t\\tand Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of\\n\\t\\t\\tfighting with each other while Allah's Apostle was standing on\\n\\t\\t\\tthe pulpit. Allah's Apostle continued quietening them till they\\n\\t\\t\\tbecame silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept\\n\\t\\t\\ton weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I\\n\\t\\t\\tsleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for\\n\\t\\t\\ttwo nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears\\n\\t\\t\\ttill they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While\\n\\t\\t\\tthey were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked\\n\\t\\t\\tpermission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started\\n\\t\\t\\tweeping with me. While I was in that state, Allah's Apostle came\\n\\t\\t\\tto us, greeted, and sat down. He had never sat with me since the\\n\\t\\t\\tday what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"Thereafter, O 'Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such a\\n\\t\\t\\tthing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your\\n\\t\\t\\tinnocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tforgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin\\n\\t\\t\\tand then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased\\n\\t\\t\\tcompletely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid to my father, \"Reply to Allah's Apostle on my behalf as to\\n\\t\\t\\twhat he said.\" He said, \"By Allah, I do not know what to say to\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle.\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle.\"\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tShe said, \"I do not know what to say to Allah's Apostle.\" Still a\\n\\t\\t\\tyoung girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Qur'an,\\n\\t\\t\\tI said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk)\\n\\t\\t\\tso much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have\\n\\t\\t\\tbelieved it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah\\n\\t\\t\\tknows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I\\n\\t\\t\\tconfess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you\\n\\t\\t\\twill believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except\\n\\t\\t\\tthat of Joseph's father: 'So (for me) patience is most fitting\\n\\t\\t\\tagainst that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help\\n\\t\\t\\tcan be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that\\n\\t\\t\\ttime I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my\\n\\t\\t\\tinnocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would send\\n\\t\\t\\tdown about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited\\n\\t\\t\\t(forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my\\n\\t\\t\\tinnocence. By Allah, Allah's Apostle had not left his seat and\\n\\t\\t\\tnobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle. So there overtook him the same hard condition\\n\\t\\t\\twhich used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so\\n\\t\\t\\tthat the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls,\\n\\t\\t\\tthough it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the\\n\\t\\t\\theaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that\\n\\t\\t\\tstate of Allah's Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was\\n\\t\\t\\trelieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared\\n\\t\\t\\tyour innocence.\" My mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank\\n\\t\\t\\tanybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Slander are a gang among you. Think it not...\" (24.11-20).\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr\\n\\t\\t\\tAs-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of\\n\\t\\t\\tthe latter's kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I\\n\\t\\t\\twill never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said\\n\\t\\t\\tabout 'Aisha.\" So Allah revealed:\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not\\n\\t\\t\\tto give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who\\n\\t\\t\\thave left their homes for Allah's Cause. Let them Pardon and\\n\\t\\t\\tforgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that Allah\\n\\t\\t\\tshould forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most\\n\\t\\t\\tMerciful.\" (24.22)\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAbu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive\\n\\t\\t\\tme.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at\\n\\t\\t\\tall.\" 'Aisha further said: Allah's Apostle also asked Zainab bint\\n\\t\\t\\tJahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What have you seen?\" She\\n\\t\\t\\treplied, \"O Allah's Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight\\n\\t\\t\\t(by refraining from telling lies).

He\\n\\t\\t\\trecited Tashah-hud, and after glorifying and praising Allah as He\\n\\t\\t\\tdeserved, he said, \"To proceed: O people! Give me your opinion\\n\\t\\t\\tregarding those people who made a forged story against my wife.\\n\\t\\t\\tBy Allah, I do not know anything bad about her. By Allah, they\\n\\t\\t\\taccused her of being with a man about whom I have never known\\n\\t\\t\\tanything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present\\n\\t\\t\\tthere, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me.\" Sad\\n\\t\\t\\tbin Mu'adh got up and said, \"O Allah's Apostle! Allow me to chop\\n\\t\\t\\ttheir heads off!\" Then a man from the Al-Khazraj (Sa'd bin\\n\\t\\t\\t'Ubada) to whom the mother of (the poet) Hassan bin Thabit was a\\n\\t\\t\\trelative, got up and said (to Sad bin Mu'adh), \"You have told a\\n\\t\\t\\tlie! By Allah, if those persons were from the Aus Tribe, you\\n\\t\\t\\twould not like to chop their heads off.\" It was probable that\\n\\t\\t\\tsome evil would take place between the Aus and the Khazraj in the\\n\\t\\t\\tmosque, and I was unaware of all that. In the evening of that\\n\\t\\t\\tday, I went out for some of my needs (i.e. to relieve myself),\\n\\t\\t\\tand Um Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Um Mistah\\n\\t\\t\\tstumbled and said, \"Let Mistah be ruined\" I said to her, \"O\\n\\t\\t\\tmother! Why do you abuse your son?\" On that Um Mistah became\\n\\t\\t\\tsilent for a while, and stumbling again, she said, \"Let Mistah be\\n\\t\\t\\truined!\" I said to her, \"Why do you abuse your son?\" She stumbled\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the third time and said, \"Let Mistah be ruined!\" whereupon I\\n\\t\\t\\trebuked her for that. She said, \"By Allah, I do not abuse him\\n\\t\\t\\texcept because of you.\" I asked her, \"Concerning what of my\\n\\t\\t\\taffairs?\" So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said, \"Has\\n\\t\\t\\tthis really happened?\" She replied, \"Yes, by Allah.\" I returned\\n\\t\\t\\tto my house, astonished (and distressed) that I did not know for\\n\\t\\t\\twhat purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick (fever) and said\\n\\t\\t\\tto Allah's Apostle, \"Send me to my father's house.\" So he sent a\\n\\t\\t\\tslave with me, and when I entered the house, I found Um Rum-an\\n\\t\\t\\t(my mother) downstairs while (my father) Abu Bakr was reciting\\n\\t\\t\\tsomething upstairs. My mother asked, \"What has brought you, O\\n\\t\\t\\t(my) daughter?\" I informed her and mentioned to her the whole\\n\\t\\t\\tstory, but she did not feel it as I did. She said, \"O my\\n\\t\\t\\tdaughter! Take it easy, for there is never a charming lady loved\\n\\t\\t\\tby her husband who has other wives but that they feel jealous of\\n\\t\\t\\ther and speak badly of her.\" But she did not feel the news as I\\n\\t\\t\\tdid. I asked (her), \"Does my father know about it?\" She said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"Yes.\" I asked, \"Does Allah's Apostle know about it too?\" She\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"Yes, Allah's Apostle does too.\" So the tears filled my\\n\\t\\t\\teyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs heard my\\n\\t\\t\\tvoice and came down and asked my mother, \"What is the matter with\\n\\t\\t\\ther? \" She said, \"She has heard what has been said about her (as\\n\\t\\t\\tregards the story of Al-Ifk).\" On that Abu- Bakr wept and said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"I beseech you by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home.\"\\n\\t\\t\\tI went back to my home and Allah's Apostle had come to my house\\n\\t\\t\\tand asked my maid-servant about me (my character). The\\n\\t\\t\\tmaid-servant said, \"By Allah, I do not know of any defect in her\\n\\t\\t\\tcharacter except that she sleeps and let the sheep enter (her\\n\\t\\t\\thouse) and eat her dough.\" On that, some of the Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanions spoke harshly to her and said, \"Tell the truth to\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle.\" Finally they told her of the affair (of the\\n\\t\\t\\tslander). She said, \"Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing\\n\\t\\t\\tagainst her except what goldsmith knows about a piece of pure\\n\\t\\t\\tgold.\" Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private\\n\\t\\t\\tparts of any woman.\" Later that man was martyred in Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tCause. Next morning my parents came to pay me a visit and they\\n\\t\\t\\tstayed with me till Allah's Apostle came to me after he had\\n\\t\\t\\toffered the Asr prayer. He came to me while my parents were\\n\\t\\t\\tsitting around me on my right and my left. He praised and\\n\\t\\t\\tglorified Allah and said, \"Now then O 'Aisha! If you have\\n\\t\\t\\tcommitted a bad deed or you have wronged (yourself), then repent\\n\\t\\t\\tto Allah as Allah accepts the repentance from his slaves.\" An\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said\\n\\t\\t\\t(to the Prophet), \"Isn't it improper that you speak in such a way\\n\\t\\t\\tin the presence of this lady? Allah's Apostle then gave a piece\\n\\t\\t\\tof advice and I turned to my father and requested him to answer\\n\\t\\t\\thim (on my behalf). My father said, \"What should I say?\" Then I\\n\\t\\t\\tturned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said, \"What\\n\\t\\t\\tshould I say?\" When my parents did not give a reply to the\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet, I said, \"I testify that none has the right to be\\n\\t\\t\\tworshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle!\" And\\n\\t\\t\\tafter praising and glorifying Allah as He deserves, I said, \"Now\\n\\t\\t\\tthen, by Allah, if I were to tell you that I have not done (this\\n\\t\\t\\tevil action) and Allah is a witness that I am telling the truth,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat would not be of any use to me on your part because you\\n\\t\\t\\t(people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it;\\n\\t\\t\\tand if I were to tell you that I have done this sin and Allah\\n\\t\\t\\tknows that I have not done it, then you will say, 'She has\\n\\t\\t\\tconfessed herself guilty.' By Allah, I do not see a suitable\\n\\t\\t\\texample for me and you but the example of (I tried to remember\\n\\t\\t\\tJacob's name but couldn't) Joseph's father when he said; So (for\\n\\t\\t\\tme) 'Patience is most fitting against that which you assert. It\\n\\t\\t\\tis Allah (alone) whose help can be sought.' \" At that very hour\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Divine Inspiration came to Allah's Apostle and we remained\\n\\t\\t\\tsilent. Then the Inspiration was over and I noticed the signs of\\n\\t\\t\\thappiness on his face while he was removing (the sweat) from his\\n\\t\\t\\tforehead and saying, \"Have the good tidings O 'Aisha! Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\trevealed your innocence.\" At that time I was extremely angry. My\\n\\t\\t\\tparents said to me. \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I\\n\\t\\t\\twill not do it and will not thank him nor thank either of you,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut I will thank Allah Who has revealed my innocence. You have\\n\\t\\t\\theard this story but neither did not deny it nor change it (to\\n\\t\\t\\tdefend me).\" ('Aisha used to say:) But as regards Zainab bint\\n\\t\\t\\tJahsh, (the Prophet's wife), Allah protected her because of her\\n\\t\\t\\tpiety, so she did not say anything except good (about me), but\\n\\t\\t\\ther sister, Hamna, was ruined among those who were ruined. Those\\n\\t\\t\\twho used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit,\\n\\t\\t\\tand the hypocrite, Abdullah bin Ubai, who used to spread that\\n\\t\\t\\tnews and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamna who\\n\\t\\t\\thad the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he\\n\\t\\t\\twould never do any favor to Mistah at all. Then Allah revealed\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Divine Verse:    \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\"Let not those among you who are good and wealthy (i.e. Abu Bakr)\\n\\t\\t\\tswear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, and those\\n\\t\\t\\tin need, (i.e. Mistah) ...Do you not love that Allah should\\n\\t\\t\\tforgive you? And Allah if Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tOn that, Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, O our Lord! We wish that\\n\\t\\t\\tYou should forgive us.\" So Abu Bakr again started giving to\\n\\t\\t\\tMistah the expenditure which he used to give him before.\\n\\t\\t</p>"
