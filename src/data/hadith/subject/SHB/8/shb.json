A big rock fell from the mountain over the mouth of the\\n\\t\\t\\tcave and blocked it. They said to each other, 'Think of such good\\n\\t\\t\\t(righteous) deeds which you did for Allah's sake only, and invoke\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah by giving reference to those deeds so that Allah may\\n\\t\\t\\trelieve you from your difficulty.' One of them said, 'O Allah! I\\n\\t\\t\\thad my parents who were very old and I had small children for\\n\\t\\t\\twhose sake I used to work as a shepherd. When I returned to them\\n\\t\\t\\tat night and milked (the sheep), I used to start giving the milk\\n\\t\\t\\tto my parents first before giving to my children. And one day I\\n\\t\\t\\twent far away in search of a grazing place (for my sheep), and\\n\\t\\t\\tdidn't return home till late at night and found that my parents\\n\\t\\t\\thad slept. I milked (my livestock) as usual and brought the milk\\n\\t\\t\\tvessel and stood at their heads, and I disliked to wake them up\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom their sleep, and I also disliked to give the milk to my\\n\\t\\t\\tchildren before my parents though my children were crying (from\\n\\t\\t\\thunger) at my feet. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tSo this state of mine and theirs continued till the day dawned.\\n\\t\\t\\t(O Allah!) If you considered that I had done that only for\\n\\t\\t\\tseeking Your pleasure, then please let there be an opening\\n\\t\\t\\tthrough which we can see the sky.' So Allah made for them an\\n\\t\\t\\topening through which they could see the sky. Then the second\\n\\t\\t\\tperson said, 'O Allah! I had a she-cousin whom I loved as much as\\n\\t\\t\\ta passionate man loves a woman. I tried to seduce her but she\\n\\t\\t\\trefused till I paid her one-hundred Dinars. So I worked hard till\\n\\t\\t\\tI collected one hundred Dinars and went to her with that. But\\n\\t\\t\\twhen I sat in between her legs (to have sexual intercourse with\\n\\t\\t\\ther), she said, 'O Allah's slave! Be afraid of Allah! Do not\\n\\t\\t\\tdeflower me except legally (by marriage contract).' So I left\\n\\t\\t\\ther. O Allah! If you considered that I had done that only for\\n\\t\\t\\tseeking Your pleasure then please let the rock move a little to\\n\\t\\t\\thave a (wider) opening.' \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tSo Allah shifted that rock to make the opening wider for them.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd the last (third) person said, 'O Allah! I employed a laborer\\n\\t\\t\\tfor wages equal to a Faraq (a certain measure) of rice, and when\\n\\t\\t\\the had finished his job he demanded his wages, but when I\\n\\t\\t\\tpresented his due to him, he gave it up and refused to take it.\\n\\t\\t\\tThen I kept on sowing that rice for him (several times) till I\\n\\t\\t\\tmanaged to buy with the price of the yield, some cows and their\\n\\t\\t\\tshepherd. Later on the laborer came to me and said. '(O Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tslave!) Be afraid of Allah, and do not be unjust to me and give\\n\\t\\t\\tme my due.' I said (to him), \"Go and take those cows and their\\n\\t\\t\\tshepherd.\" So he took them and went away. (So, O Allah!) If You\\n\\t\\t\\tconsidered that I had done that for seeking Your pleasure, then\\n\\t\\t\\tplease remove the remaining part of the rock.'

He will keep on invoking Allah\\n\\t\\t\\ttill Allah says, 'Perhaps, if I give you what you want, you will\\n\\t\\t\\task for another thing?' The man will say, 'No, by Your Power, I\\n\\t\\t\\twill not ask You for anything else.' \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen Allah will turn his face away from the Fire.

After we had left, some camels of booty were\\n\\t\\t\\tbrought to Allah's Apostle and he said, 'Where are those\\n\\t\\t\\tAsh'ariyin? Where are those Ash'ariyin?' So we went (to him) and\\n\\t\\t\\the gave us five very fat good-looking camels. We mounted them and\\n\\t\\t\\twent away, and then I said to my companions, 'We went to Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle to give us mounts, but he took an oath that he would not\\n\\t\\t\\tgive us mounts, and then later on he sent for us and gave us\\n\\t\\t\\tmounts, perhaps Allah's Apostle forgot his oath. By Allah, we\\n\\t\\t\\twill never be successful, for we have taken advantage of the fact\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Allah's Apostle forgot to fulfill his oath. So let us return\\n\\t\\t\\tto Allah's Apostle to remind him of his oath.' We returned and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'O Allah's Apostle! We came to you and asked you for\\n\\t\\t\\tmounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us mounts)\\n\\t\\t\\tbut later on you gave us mounts, and we thought or considered\\n\\t\\t\\tthat you have forgotten your oath.' The Prophet said, 'Depart,\\n\\t\\t\\tfor Allah has given you Mounts. By Allah, Allah willing, if I\\n\\t\\t\\ttake an oath and then later find another thing better than that,\\n\\t\\t\\tI do what is better, and make expiation for the oath.' \"\\n\\t\\t</p>"

There was a man sitting amongst them and\\n\\t\\t\\twrapped in something. I asked, 'Who is that man?' They said, 'He\\n\\t\\t\\tis Sa'd bin 'Ubada.' I asked, 'What is wrong with him?' They\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'He is sick.' After we sat for a while, the Ansar's speaker\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,' and\\n\\t\\t\\tpraising Allah as He deserved, he added, 'To proceed, we are\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Ansar (helpers) and the majority of the Muslim army,\\n\\t\\t\\twhile you, the emigrants, are a small group and some people among\\n\\t\\t\\tyou came with the intention of preventing us from practicing this\\n\\t\\t\\tmatter (of caliphate) and depriving us of it.' \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had\\n\\t\\t\\tprepared a speech which I liked and which I wanted to deliver in\\n\\t\\t\\tthe presence of Abu Bakr, and I used to avoid provoking him. So,\\n\\t\\t\\twhen I wanted to speak, Abu Bakr said, 'Wait a while.' I disliked\\n\\t\\t\\tto make him angry. So Abu Bakr himself gave a speech, and he was\\n\\t\\t\\twiser and more patient than I. By Allah, he never missed a\\n\\t\\t\\tsentence that I liked in my own prepared speech, but he said the\\n\\t\\t\\tlike of it or better than it spontaneously. After a pause he\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'O Ansar! You deserve all (the qualities) that you have\\n\\t\\t\\tattributed to yourselves, but this question (of Caliphate) is\\n\\t\\t\\tonly for the Quraish as they are the best of the Arabs as regards\\n\\t\\t\\tdescent and home, and I am pleased to suggest that you choose\\n\\t\\t\\teither of these two men, so take the oath of allegiance to either\\n\\t\\t\\tof them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr held my hand and Abu Ubada\\n\\t\\t\\tbin Abdullah's hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing\\n\\t\\t\\tof what he had said except that proposal, for by Allah, I would\\n\\t\\t\\trather have my neck chopped off as expiator for a sin than become\\n\\t\\t\\tthe ruler of a nation, one of whose members is Abu Bakr, unless\\n\\t\\t\\tat the time of my death my own self suggests something I don't\\n\\t\\t\\tfeel at present.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd then one of the Ansar said, 'I am the pillar on which the\\n\\t\\t\\tcamel with a skin disease (eczema) rubs itself to satisfy the\\n\\t\\t\\titching (i.e., I am a noble), and I am as a high class palm tree!\\n\\t\\t\\tO Quraish.

And so we\\n\\t\\t\\tbecame victorious over Sa'd bin Ubada (whom Al-Ansar wanted to\\n\\t\\t\\tmake a ruler). One of the Ansar said, 'You have killed Sa'd bin\\n\\t\\t\\tUbada.'
