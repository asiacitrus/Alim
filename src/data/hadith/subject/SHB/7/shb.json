His bed is as narrow\r\\n\\t\\t\\tas an unsheathed sword and an arm of a kid (of four months)\r\\n\\t\\t\\tsatisfies his hunger.  As for the daughter of Abu Zar, she is\r\\n\\t\\t\\tobedient to her father and to her mother.

When I went, I would bring him the news of what had happened\\n\\t\\t\\tthat day regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and\\n\\t\\t\\twhen he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people of\\n\\t\\t\\tQuraish used to have the upper hand over our wives, but when we\\n\\t\\t\\tcame to the Ansar, we found that their women had the upper hand\\n\\t\\t\\tover their men, so our women also started learning the ways of\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Ansari women.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tI shouted at my wife and she retorted against me and I disliked\\n\\t\\t\\tthat she should answer me back.

The (talk)\\n\\t\\t\\tscared me and I said to her, 'Whoever has done so will be\\n\\t\\t\\truined!' Then I proceeded after dressing myself, and entered upon\\n\\t\\t\\tHafsa and said to her, 'Does anyone of you keep the Prophet angry\\n\\t\\t\\ttill night?' She said, 'Yes.' I said, 'You are a ruined losing\\n\\t\\t\\tperson! Don't you fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle and thus you will be ruined? So do not ask more\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom the Prophet and do not answer him back and do not give up\\n\\t\\t\\ttalking to him.

My\\n\\t\\t\\tAnsari companion, on the day of his turn, went (to the town) and\\n\\t\\t\\treturned to us at night and knocked at my door violently and\\n\\t\\t\\tasked if I was there. I became horrified and came out to him. He\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'Today a great thing has happened.' I asked, 'What is it?\\n\\t\\t\\tHave (the people of) Ghassan come?' He said, 'No, but (What has\\n\\t\\t\\thappened) is greater and more horrifying than that: Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle has divorced his wives.' \"  \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t'Umar added, \"The Prophet kept away from his wives and I said\\n\\t\\t\\t'Hafsa is a ruined loser.' I had already thought that most\\n\\t\\t\\tprobably this (divorce) would happen in the near future. So I\\n\\t\\t\\tdressed myself and offered the morning prayer with the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\tand then the Prophet entered an upper room and stayed there in\\n\\t\\t\\tseclusion. I entered upon Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked,\\n\\t\\t\\t'What makes you weep? Did I not warn you about that? Did the\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet divorce you all?' She said, 'I do not know. There he is\\n\\t\\t\\tretired alone in the upper room.' I came out and sat near the\\n\\t\\t\\tpulpit and saw a group of people sitting around it and some of\\n\\t\\t\\tthem were weeping. I sat with them for a while but could not\\n\\t\\t\\tendure the situation, so I went to the upper room where the\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet was and said to a black slave of his, 'Will you get the\\n\\t\\t\\tpermission (of the Prophet ) for 'Umar (to enter)?' The slave\\n\\t\\t\\twent in, talked to the Prophet about it and then returned saying,\\n\\t\\t\\t'I have spoken to the Prophet and mentioned you but he kept\\n\\t\\t\\tquiet.' Then I returned and sat with the group of people sitting\\n\\t\\t\\tnear the pulpit. but I could not bear the situation and once\\n\\t\\t\\tagain I said to the slave, 'Will you get the permission for\\n\\t\\t\\t'Umar?' He went in and returned saying, 'I mentioned you to him\\n\\t\\t\\tbut he kept quiet.' So I returned again and sat with the group of\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople sitting near the pulpit, but I could not bear the\\n\\t\\t\\tsituation, and so I went to the slave and said, 'Will you get the\\n\\t\\t\\tpermission for 'Umar?' He went in and returned to me saying, 'I\\n\\t\\t\\tmentioned you to him but he kept quiet.' When I was leaving,\\n\\t\\t\\tbehold! The slave called me, saying, 'The Prophet has given you\\n\\t\\t\\tpermission.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen I entered upon Allah's Apostle and saw him lying on a bed\\n\\t\\t\\tmade of stalks of date palm leaves and there was no bedding\\n\\t\\t\\tbetween it and him. The stalks left marks on his side and he was\\n\\t\\t\\tleaning on a leather pillow stuffed with date-palm fires. I\\n\\t\\t\\tgreeted him and while still standing I said, 'O Allah's Apostle!\\n\\t\\t\\tHave you divorced your wives?' He looked at me and said, 'No.' I\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'Allahu Akbar!' And then, while still standing, I said\\n\\t\\t\\tchatting, 'Will you heed what I say, O Allah's Apostle? We, the\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople of Quraish used to have power over our women, but when we\\n\\t\\t\\tarrived at Medina we found that the men (here) were overpowered\\n\\t\\t\\tby their women.' The Prophet smiled and then I said to him, 'Will\\n\\t\\t\\tyou heed what I say, O Allah's Apostle?' I entered upon Hafsa and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid to her, 'Do not be tempted to imitate your companion\\n\\t\\t\\t('Aisha), for she is more charming than you and more beloved to\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet.' The Prophet smiled for a second time. When I saw\\n\\t\\t\\thim smiling, I sat down. Then I looked around his house, and by\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah, I could not see anything of importance in his house except\\n\\t\\t\\tthree hides, so I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah to make\\n\\t\\t\\tyour followers rich, for the Persians and the Romans have been\\n\\t\\t\\tmade prosperous and they have been given (the pleasures of the\\n\\t\\t\\tworld), although they do not worship Allah.' Thereupon the\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet sat up as he was reclining. and said, 'Are you of such an\\n\\t\\t\\topinion, O the son of Al-Khattab? These are the people who have\\n\\t\\t\\treceived the rewards for their good deeds in this world.' I said,\\n\\t\\t\\t'O Allah's Apostle! Ask Allah to forgive me.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen the Prophet kept away from his wives for twenty-nine days\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause of the story which Hafsa had disclosed to 'Aisha. The\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet had said, 'I will not enter upon them (my wives) for one\\n\\t\\t\\tmonth,' because of his anger towards them, when Allah had\\n\\t\\t\\tadmonished him.  So, when twenty nine days had passed, the\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet first entered upon 'Aisha. 'Aisha said to him, 'O Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle! You had sworn that you would not enter upon us for one\\n\\t\\t\\tmonth, but now only twenty-nine days have passed, for I have been\\n\\t\\t\\tcounting them one by one.' The Prophet said, 'The (present) month\\n\\t\\t\\tis of twenty nine days.' 'Aisha added, 'Then Allah revealed the\\n\\t\\t\\tVerses of the option. (2) And out of all his wives he asked me\\n\\t\\t\\tfirst, and I chose him.' Then he gave option to his other wives\\n\\t\\t\\tand they said what 'Aisha had said.\" (1) The Prophet had decided\\n\\t\\t\\tto abstain from eating a certain kind of food because of a\\n\\t\\t\\tcertain event, so Allah blamed him for doing so. Some of his\\n\\t\\t\\twives were the cause of him taking that decision, therefore he\\n\\t\\t\\tdeserted them for one month. See Qur'an: (66.4)\\n\\t\\t</p>"

The Prophet entered and said to Abu Bakr, \"Let those\r\\n\\t\\t\\twho are with you, go out.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"(There is no\r\\n\\t\\t\\tstranger); they are your family. Let my father be sacrificed for\r\\n\\t\\t\\tyou, O Allah's Apostle!\" The Prophet said, \"I have been allowed\r\\n\\t\\t\\tto leave (Mecca).\" Abu Bakr said, \"Shall I accompany you, O\r\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle? Let my father be sacrificed for you!\" The\r\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet said, \"Yes.\" Abu Bakr said, \"O Allah's Apostle! Let my\r\\n\\t\\t\\tfather be sacrificed for you! Take one of these two she-camels of\r\\n\\t\\t\\tmine.\" The Prophet said, \"I will take it only after paying its\r\\n\\t\\t\\tprice.\" So we prepared their baggage and put their journey food\r\\n\\t\\t\\tin a leather bag. And Asma' bint Abu Bakr cut a piece of her\r\\n\\t\\t\\tgirdle and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it. That is why\r\\n\\t\\t\\tshe was called Dhat-an-Nitaqain. Then the Prophet and Abu Bakr\r\\n\\t\\t\\twent to a cave in a mountain called Thour and remained there for\r\\n\\t\\t\\tthree nights. 'Abdullah bin Abu Bakr, who was a young intelligent\r\\n\\t\\t\\tman, used to stay with them at night and leave before dawn so\r\\n\\t\\t\\tthat in the morning, he would be with the Quraish at Mecca as if\r\\n\\t\\t\\the had spent the night among them. If he heard of any plot\r\\n\\t\\t\\tcontrived by the Quraish against the Prophet and Abu Bakr, he\r\\n\\t\\t\\twould understand it and (return to) inform them of it when it\r\\n\\t\\t\\tbecame dark. 'Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr used\r\\n\\t\\t\\tto graze a flock of milch sheep for them and he used to take\r\\n\\t\\t\\tthose sheep to them when an hour had passed after the 'Isha\r\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer. They would sleep soundly till 'Amir bin Fuhaira awakened\r\\n\\t\\t\\tthem when it was still dark. He used to do that in each of those\r\\n\\t\\t\\tthree nights.\r\\n\\t\\t</p>"
