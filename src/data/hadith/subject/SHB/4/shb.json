Then I asked you\\n\\t\\t\\twhether any of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the\\n\\t\\t\\tnegative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have\\n\\t\\t\\tthought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen I asked you whether the rich or the poor people followed\\n\\t\\t\\thim, you replied that it was the poor who followed him. In fact,\\n\\t\\t\\tsuch are the followers of the apostles. Then I asked you whether\\n\\t\\t\\this followers were increasing or decreasing. You replied that\\n\\t\\t\\tthey were increasing. In fact, this is the result of true faith\\n\\t\\t\\ttill it is complete (in all respects). I asked you whether there\\n\\t\\t\\twas anybody who, after embracing his religion, became displeased\\n\\t\\t\\tand discarded his religion; your reply was in the negative. In\\n\\t\\t\\tfact, this is the sign of true faith, for when its cheerfulness\\n\\t\\t\\tenters and mixes in the hearts completely, nobody will be\\n\\t\\t\\tdispleased with it. I asked you whether he had ever broken his\\n\\t\\t\\tpromise. You replied in the negative. And such are the apostles;\\n\\t\\t\\tthey never break their promises. When I asked you whether you\\n\\t\\t\\tfought with him and he fought with you, you replied that he did,\\n\\t\\t\\tand that sometimes he was victorious and sometimes you. Indeed,\\n\\t\\t\\tsuch are the apostles; they are put to trials and the final\\n\\t\\t\\tvictory is always theirs. Then I asked you what he ordered you.\\n\\t\\t\\tYou replied that he ordered you to worship Allah alone and not to\\n\\t\\t\\tworship others along with Him, to leave all that your\\n\\t\\t\\tfore-fathers used to worship, to offer prayers, to speak the\\n\\t\\t\\ttruth, to be chaste, to keep promises, and to return what is\\n\\t\\t\\tentrusted to you.

About two-hundred\\n\\t\\t\\tmen, who were all archers, hurried to follow their tracks till\\n\\t\\t\\tthey found the place where they had eaten dates they had brought\\n\\t\\t\\twith them from Medina.

I will not come down to be under the\\n\\t\\t\\tprotection of infidels. O Allah! Convey our news to Your\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet.\" Then the infidels threw arrows at them till they\\n\\t\\t\\tmartyred Asim along with six other men, and three men came down\\n\\t\\t\\taccepting their promise and convention, and they were\\n\\t\\t\\tKhubaib-al-Ansari and Ibn Dathina and another man. So, when the\\n\\t\\t\\tinfidels captured them, they undid the strings of their bows and\\n\\t\\t\\ttied them. Then the third (of the captives) said, \"This is the\\n\\t\\t\\tfirst betrayal.

No doubt these,\\n\\t\\t\\tnamely the martyred, have set a good example to us.\" So, they\\n\\t\\t\\tdragged him and tried to compel him to accompany them, but as he\\n\\t\\t\\trefused, they killed him. They took Khubaid and Ibn Dathina with\\n\\t\\t\\tthem and sold them (as slaves) in Mecca (and all that took place)\\n\\t\\t\\tafter the battle of Badr. Khubaib was bought by the sons of\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Harith bin Amir bin Naufal bin Abd Manaf. It was Khubaib who\\n\\t\\t\\thad killed Al-Harith bin Amir on the day (of the battle of) Badr.\\n\\t\\t\\tSo, Khubaib remained a prisoner with those people.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tNarrated Az-Zuhri: Ubaidullah bin Iyyad said that the daughter of\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Harith had told him, \"When those people gathered (to kill\\n\\t\\t\\tKhubaib) he borrowed a razor from me to shave his pubes and I\\n\\t\\t\\tgave it to him. Then he took a son of mine while I was unaware\\n\\t\\t\\twhen he came upon him. I saw him placing my son on his thigh and\\n\\t\\t\\tthe razor was in his hand. I got scared so much that Khubaib\\n\\t\\t\\tnoticed the agitation on my face and said, 'Are you afraid that I\\n\\t\\t\\twill kill him? No, I will never do so.' By Allah, I never saw a\\n\\t\\t\\tprisoner better than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating\\n\\t\\t\\tof a bunch of grapes in his hand while he was chained in irons,\\n\\t\\t\\tand there was no fruit at that time in Mecca.\" The daughter of\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Harith used to say, \"It was a boon Allah bestowed upon\\n\\t\\t\\tKhubaib.\" When they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to\\n\\t\\t\\tkill him outside its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let\\n\\t\\t\\thim offer two rakat (prayer). They allowed him and he offered two\\n\\t\\t\\trakat and then said, \"Hadn't I been afraid that you would think\\n\\t\\t\\tthat I was afraid (of being killed), I would have prolonged the\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer. O Allah, kill them all with no exception.\" (He then\\n\\t\\t\\trecited the poetic verse):  \"I being martyred as a Muslim, Do not\\n\\t\\t\\tmind how I am killed in Allah's cause, For my killing is for\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's sake, And if Allah wishes, He will bless the amputated\\n\\t\\t\\tparts of a torn body.\" Then the son of Al Harith killed him. So,\\n\\t\\t\\tit was Khubaib who set the tradition for any Muslim sentenced to\\n\\t\\t\\tdeath in captivity, to offer a two-rakat prayer (before being\\n\\t\\t\\tkilled). Allah fulfilled the invocation of Asim bin Thabit on\\n\\t\\t\\tthat very day on which he was martyred. The Prophet informed his\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanions of their news and what had happened to them. Later on\\n\\t\\t\\twhen some infidels from Quraish were informed that Asim had been\\n\\t\\t\\tkilled, they sent some people to fetch a part of his body (i.e.\\n\\t\\t\\this head) by which he would be recognized. (That was because)\\n\\t\\t\\tAsim had killed one of their chiefs on the day (of the battle) of\\n\\t\\t\\tBadr. So, a swarm of wasps, resembling a shady cloud, were sent\\n\\t\\t\\tto hover over Asim and protect him from their messenger and thus\\n\\t\\t\\tthey could not cut off anything from his flesh.\\n\\t\\t</p>"

Al-Buraq, a white animal, smaller than a mule and bigger\\n\\t\\t\\tthan a donkey was brought to me and I set out with Gabriel. When\\n\\t\\t\\tI reached the nearest heaven.

Then I met Adam and\\n\\t\\t\\tgreeted him and he said, 'You are welcomed O son and a Prophet.'\\n\\t\\t\\tThen we ascended to the second heaven. It was asked, 'Who is it?'\\n\\t\\t\\tGabriel said, 'Gabriel.' It was said, 'Who is with you?' He said,\\n\\t\\t\\t'Muhammad' It was asked, 'Has he been sent for?' He said, 'Yes.'\\n\\t\\t\\tIt was said, 'He is welcomed.

Then we ascended to the 4th heaven and\\n\\t\\t\\tagain the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the\\n\\t\\t\\tprevious heavens. There I met Idris and greeted him.

Then I was shown\\n\\t\\t\\tSidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. a tree in the seventh heaven) and I saw\\n\\t\\t\\tits Nabk fruits which resembled the clay jugs of Hajr (i.e. a\\n\\t\\t\\ttown in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears of elephants,\\n\\t\\t\\tand four rivers originated at its root, two of them were apparent\\n\\t\\t\\tand two were hidden. I asked Gabriel about those rivers and he\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'The two hidden rivers are in Paradise, and the apparent\\n\\t\\t\\tones are the Nile and the Euphrates.' Then fifty prayers were\\n\\t\\t\\tenjoined on me. I descended till I met Moses who asked me, 'What\\n\\t\\t\\thave you done?' I said, 'Fifty prayers have been enjoined on me.'\\n\\t\\t\\tHe said, 'I know the people better than you, because I had the\\n\\t\\t\\thardest experience to bring Bani Israel to obedience. Your\\n\\t\\t\\tfollowers cannot put up with such obligation. So, return to your\\n\\t\\t\\tLord and request Him (to reduce the number of prayers.' I\\n\\t\\t\\treturned and requested Allah (for reduction) and He made it\\n\\t\\t\\tforty. I returned and (met Moses) and had a similar discussion,\\n\\t\\t\\tand then returned again to Allah for reduction and He made it\\n\\t\\t\\tthirty, then twenty, then ten, and then I came to Moses who\\n\\t\\t\\trepeated the same advice. Ultimately Allah reduced it to five.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen I came to Moses again, he said, 'What have you done?' I\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'Allah has made it five only.' He repeated the same advice\\n\\t\\t\\tbut I said that I surrendered (to Allah's Final Order)' \" Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle was addressed by Allah, \"I have decreed My obligation and\\n\\t\\t\\thave reduced the burden on My slaves, and I shall reward a single\\n\\t\\t\\tgood deed as if it were ten good deeds.\"\\n\\t\\t</p>"

The House (i.e. Kaba) at that time was on a high place\\n\\t\\t\\tresembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its\\n\\t\\t\\tright and left. She lived in that way till some people from the\\n\\t\\t\\ttribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her\\n\\t\\t\\tchild, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the\\n\\t\\t\\tway of Kada'. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they\\n\\t\\t\\tsaw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not\\n\\t\\t\\tleaving it. They said, 'This bird must be flying around water,\\n\\t\\t\\tthough we know that there is no water in this valley.' They sent\\n\\t\\t\\tone or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and\\n\\t\\t\\treturned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards\\n\\t\\t\\tthe water).\" The Prophet added, \"Ishmael's mother was sitting\\n\\t\\t\\tnear the water. They asked her, 'Do you allow us to stay with\\n\\t\\t\\tyou?'

So, they settled\\n\\t\\t\\tthere, and later on they sent for their families who came and\\n\\t\\t\\tsettled with them so that some families became permanent\\n\\t\\t\\tresidents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt\\n\\t\\t\\tArabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire\\n\\t\\t\\thim as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they\\n\\t\\t\\tmade him marry a woman from amongst them. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAfter Ishmael's mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmael's\\n\\t\\t\\tmarriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but\\n\\t\\t\\the did not find Ishmael there.

Then\\n\\t\\t\\the asked her about their way of living and their condition, and\\n\\t\\t\\tshe replied, 'We are living in misery; we are living in hardship\\n\\t\\t\\tand destitution,' complaining to him. He said, 'When your husband\\n\\t\\t\\treturns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the\\n\\t\\t\\tthreshold of the gate (of his house).' When Ishmael came, he\\n\\t\\t\\tseemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, 'Has\\n\\t\\t\\tanyone visited you?' She replied, 'Yes, an old man of so-and-so\\n\\t\\t\\tdescription came and asked me about you and I informed him, and\\n\\t\\t\\the asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were\\n\\t\\t\\tliving in a hardship and poverty.'

She replied, 'Yes, he told me to convey his\\n\\t\\t\\tsalutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your\\n\\t\\t\\tgate.' Ishmael said, 'It was my father, and he has ordered me to\\n\\t\\t\\tdivorce you. Go back to your family.' So, Ishmael divorced her\\n\\t\\t\\tand married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah\\n\\t\\t\\twished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he\\n\\t\\t\\tcame to Ishmael's wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, 'He\\n\\t\\t\\thas gone in search of our livelihood.' Abraham asked her, 'How\\n\\t\\t\\tare you getting on?' asking her about their sustenance and\\n\\t\\t\\tliving. She replied, 'We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we\\n\\t\\t\\thave everything in abundance).' Then she thanked Allah. Abraham\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'What kind of food do you eat?' She said. 'Meat.' He said,\\n\\t\\t\\t'What do you drink?' She said, 'Water.\" He said, \"O Allah!

When Ishmael came back, he asked\\n\\t\\t\\this wife, 'Did anyone call on you?'

They had a water-skin with them containing\\n\\t\\t\\tsome water, Ishmael's mother used to drink water from the\\n\\t\\t\\twater-skin so that her milk would increase for her child. When\\n\\t\\t\\tAbraham reached Mecca, he made her sit under a tree and\\n\\t\\t\\tafterwards returned home. Ishmael's mother followed him, and when\\n\\t\\t\\tthey reached Kada', she called him from behind, \"O Abraham! To\\n\\t\\t\\twhom are you leaving us?\" He replied, \"(I am leaving you) to\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's (care).\" She said, \"I am satisfied to be with Allah.\" She\\n\\t\\t\\treturned to her place and started drinking water from the\\n\\t\\t\\twater-skin, and her milk increased for her child. When the water\\n\\t\\t\\thad all been used up, she said to herself, \"I'd better go and\\n\\t\\t\\tlook so that I may see somebody.\" She ascended the Safa mountain\\n\\t\\t\\tand looked, hoping to see somebody, but in vain. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen she came down to the valley, she ran till she reached the\\n\\t\\t\\tMarwa mountain. She ran to and fro (between the two mountains)\\n\\t\\t\\tmany times. They she said to herself, \"I'd better go and see the\\n\\t\\t\\tstate of the child.\" She went and found it in a state of one on\\n\\t\\t\\tthe point of dying. She could not endure to watch it dying and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid (to herself), \"If I go and look, I may find somebody.\" She\\n\\t\\t\\twent and ascended the Safa mountain and looked for a long while\\n\\t\\t\\tbut could not find anybody. Thus she completed seven rounds (of\\n\\t\\t\\trunning) between Safa and Marwa. Again she said (to herself),\\n\\t\\t\\t\"I'd better go back and see the state of the child.\" But suddenly\\n\\t\\t\\tshe heard a voice, and she said to that strange voice, \"Help us\\n\\t\\t\\tif you can offer any help.\" Lo! It was Gabriel (who had made the\\n\\t\\t\\tvoice). \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tGabriel hit the earth with his heel like this (Ibn 'Abbas hit the\\n\\t\\t\\tearth with his heel to illustrate it), and so the water gushed\\n\\t\\t\\tout. Ishmael's mother was astonished and started digging. (Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Qasim) (i.e. the Prophet) said, \"If she had left the water,\\n\\t\\t\\t(flow naturally without her intervention), it would have been\\n\\t\\t\\tflowing on the surface of the earth.\") Ishmael's mother started\\n\\t\\t\\tdrinking from the water and her milk increased for her child.\\n\\t\\t\\tAfterwards some people of the tribe of Jurhum, while passing\\n\\t\\t\\tthrough the bottom of the valley, saw some birds, and that\\n\\t\\t\\tastonished them, and they said, \"Birds can only be found at a\\n\\t\\t\\tplace where there is water.\" They sent a messenger who searched\\n\\t\\t\\tthe place and found the water, and returned to inform them about\\n\\t\\t\\tit. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen they all went to her and said, \"O Ishmael's mother! Will you\\n\\t\\t\\tallow us to be with you (or dwell with you)?\" (And thus they\\n\\t\\t\\tstayed there.) Later on her boy reached the age of puberty and\\n\\t\\t\\tmarried a lady from them. Then an idea occurred to Abraham which\\n\\t\\t\\the disclosed to his wife (Sarah), \"I want to call on my\\n\\t\\t\\tdependents I left (at Mecca).\" When he went there, he greeted\\n\\t\\t\\t(Ishmael's wife) and said, \"Where is Ishmael?\" She replied, \"He\\n\\t\\t\\thas gone out hunting.\" Abraham said (to her), \"When he comes,\\n\\t\\t\\ttell him to change the threshold of his gate.\" When he came, she\\n\\t\\t\\ttold him the same whereupon Ishmael said to her, \"You are the\\n\\t\\t\\tthreshold, so go to your family (i.e. you are divorced).\"\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAgain Abraham thought of visiting his dependents whom he had left\\n\\t\\t\\t(at Mecca), and he told his wife (Sarah) of his intentions.\\n\\t\\t\\tAbraham came to Ishmael's house and asked. \"Where is Ishmael?\"\\n\\t\\t\\tIshmael's wife replied, \"He has gone out hunting,\" and added,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"Will you stay (for some time) and have something to eat and\\n\\t\\t\\tdrink?\" Abraham asked, \"What is your food and what is your\\n\\t\\t\\tdrink?\" She replied, \"Our food is meat and our drink is water.\"\\n\\t\\t\\tHe said, \"O Allah! Bless their meals and their drink.\" Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Qa-sim (i.e. Prophet) said, \"Because of Abraham's invocation\\n\\t\\t\\tthere are blessings (in Mecca).\" Once more Abraham thought of\\n\\t\\t\\tvisiting his family he had left (at Mecca), so he told his wife\\n\\t\\t\\t(Sarah) of his decision. He went and found Ishmael behind the\\n\\t\\t\\tZam-zam well, mending his arrows. He said, \"O Ishmael, Your Lord\\n\\t\\t\\thas ordered me to build a house for Him.\" Ishmael said, \"Obey\\n\\t\\t\\t(the order of) your Lord.\" Abraham said, \"Allah has also ordered\\n\\t\\t\\tme that you should help me therein.\" Ishmael said, \"Then I will\\n\\t\\t\\tdo.\" So, both of them rose and Abraham started building (the\\n\\t\\t\\tKa'ba) while Ishmael went on handing him the stones, and both of\\n\\t\\t\\tthem were saying, \"O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us,\\n\\t\\t\\tVerily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)  When\\n\\t\\t\\tthe building became high and the old man (i.e. Abraham) could no\\n\\t\\t\\tlonger lift the stones (to such a high position), he stood over\\n\\t\\t\\tthe stone of Al-Maqam and Ishmael carried on handing him the\\n\\t\\t\\tstones, and both of them were saying, -O our Lord!

Ubai bin Ka'b told us\\n\\t\\t\\tthat the Prophet said, 'Once Moses stood up and addressed Bani\\n\\t\\t\\tIsrael. He was asked who was the most learned man amongst the\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople. He said, 'I.' Allah admonished him as he did not\\n\\t\\t\\tattribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So, Allah said to\\n\\t\\t\\thim, 'Yes, at the junction of the two seas there is a slave of\\n\\t\\t\\tMine who is more learned than you.' Moses said, 'O my Lord! How\\n\\t\\t\\tcan I meet him?' Allah said, 'Take a fish and put it in a large\\n\\t\\t\\tbasket and you will find him at the place where you will lose the\\n\\t\\t\\tfish.' Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and proceeded\\n\\t\\t\\talong with his (servant) boy, Yusha 'bin Nun, till they reached\\n\\t\\t\\tthe rock where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down). Moses\\n\\t\\t\\tslept, and the fish, moving out of the basket, fell into the sea.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt took its way into the sea (straight) as in a tunnel. Allah\\n\\t\\t\\tstopped the flow of water over the fish and it became like an\\n\\t\\t\\tarch (the Prophet pointed out this arch with his hands). \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThey travelled the rest of the night, and the next day Moses said\\n\\t\\t\\tto his boy (servant), 'Give us our food, for indeed, we have\\n\\t\\t\\tsuffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.' Moses did not\\n\\t\\t\\tfeel tired till he crossed that place which Allah had ordered him\\n\\t\\t\\tto seek after. His boy (servant) said to him, 'Do you know that\\n\\t\\t\\twhen we were sitting near that rock, I forgot the fish, and none\\n\\t\\t\\tbut Satan caused me to forget to tell (you) about it, and it took\\n\\t\\t\\tits course into the sea in an amazing way?' So there was a path\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the fish and that astonished them. Moses said, 'That was what\\n\\t\\t\\twe were seeking after.' So, both of them retraced their footsteps\\n\\t\\t\\ttill they reached the rock. There they saw a man lying covered\\n\\t\\t\\twith a garment. Moses greeted him and he replied saying, 'How do\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople greet each other in your land?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.'\\n\\t\\t\\tThe man asked, 'Moses of Bani Israel?' Moses said, 'Yes, I have\\n\\t\\t\\tcome to you so that you may teach me from those things which\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah has taught you.' He said, 'O Moses! I have some of the\\n\\t\\t\\tknowledge of Allah which Allah has taught me, and which you do\\n\\t\\t\\tnot know, while you have some of the knowledge of Allah which\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah has taught you and which I do not know.' Moses asked, 'May\\n\\t\\t\\tI follow you?' He said, 'But you will not be able to remain\\n\\t\\t\\tpatient with me for how can you be patient about things which you\\n\\t\\t\\twill not be able to understand?' (Moses said, 'You will find me,\\n\\t\\t\\tif Allah so will, truly patient, and I will not disobey you in\\n\\t\\t\\taught.') So, both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, a\\n\\t\\t\\tboat passed by them and they asked the crew of the boat to take\\n\\t\\t\\tthem on board.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThe crew recognized Al-Khadir and so they took them on board\\n\\t\\t\\twithout fare. When they were on board the boat, a sparrow came\\n\\t\\t\\tand stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or\\n\\t\\t\\ttwice into the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, 'O Moses! My\\n\\t\\t\\tknowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allah's knowledge\\n\\t\\t\\texcept as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea\\n\\t\\t\\twith its beak.' Then suddenly Al-Khadir took an adze and plucked\\n\\t\\t\\ta plank, and Moses did not notice it till he had plucked a plank\\n\\t\\t\\twith the adze. Moses said to him, 'What have you done? They took\\n\\t\\t\\tus on board charging us nothing; yet you  have intentionally made\\n\\t\\t\\ta hole in their boat so as to drown its passengers. Verily, you\\n\\t\\t\\thave done a dreadful thing.' Al-Khadir replied, 'Did I not tell\\n\\t\\t\\tyou that you would not be able to remain patient with me?' Moses\\n\\t\\t\\treplied, 'Do not blame me for what I have forgotten, and do not\\n\\t\\t\\tbe hard upon me for my fault.' So the first excuse of Moses was\\n\\t\\t\\tthat he had forgotten. When they had left the sea, they passed by\\n\\t\\t\\ta boy playing with other boys.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Khadir took hold of the boy's head and plucked it with his\\n\\t\\t\\thand like this. (Sufyan, the sub narrator pointed with his\\n\\t\\t\\tfingertips as if he was plucking some fruit.) Moses said to him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"Have you killed an innocent person who has not killed any\\n\\t\\t\\tperson? You have really done a horrible thing.\" Al-Khadir said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"Did I not tell you that you could not remain patient with me?\"\\n\\t\\t\\tMoses said, \"If I ask you about anything after this, don't\\n\\t\\t\\taccompany me. You have received an excuse from me.\" Then both of\\n\\t\\t\\tthem went on till they came to some people of a village, and they\\n\\t\\t\\tasked its inhabitant for wood but they refused to entertain them\\n\\t\\t\\tas guests. Then they saw therein a wall which was just going to\\n\\t\\t\\tcollapse (and Al Khadir repaired it just by touching it with his\\n\\t\\t\\thands). (Sufyan, the sub-narrator, pointed with his hands,\\n\\t\\t\\tillustrating how Al-Khadir passed his hands over the wall\\n\\t\\t\\tupwards.) Moses said, \"These are the people whom we have called\\n\\t\\t\\ton, but they neither gave us food, nor entertained us as guests,\\n\\t\\t\\tyet you have repaired their wall. If you had wished, you could\\n\\t\\t\\thave taken wages for it.\" Al-Khadir said, \"This is the parting\\n\\t\\t\\tbetween you and me, and I shall tell you the explanation of those\\n\\t\\t\\tthings on which you could not remain patient.\"\\t The Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\tadded, \"We wished that Moses could have remained patient by\\n\\t\\t\\tvirtue of which Allah might have told us more about their story.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\" (Sufyan the sub-narrator said that the Prophet said, \"May Allah\\n\\t\\t\\tbestow His Mercy on Moses!

Later on when he came to me asking for his\\n\\t\\t\\twages, I said (to him), 'Go to those cows and drive them away.'\\n\\t\\t\\tHe said to me, 'But you have to pay me only a Faraq of rice,' I\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid to him, 'Go to those cows and take them, for they are the\\n\\t\\t\\tproduct of that Faraq (of rice).' So he drove them. O Allah! If\\n\\t\\t\\tyou consider that I did that for fear of You, then please remove\\n\\t\\t\\tthe rock.' The rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. The\\n\\t\\t\\tsecond one said, 'O Allah, You know that I had old parents whom I\\n\\t\\t\\tused to provide with the milk of my sheep every night. One night\\n\\t\\t\\tI was delayed and when I came, they had slept, while my wife and\\n\\t\\t\\tchildren were crying with hunger. I used not to let them (i.e. my\\n\\t\\t\\tfamily) drink unless my parents had drunk first. So I disliked to\\n\\t\\t\\twake them up and also disliked that they should sleep without\\n\\t\\t\\tdrinking it, I kept on waiting (for them to wake) till it dawned.\\n\\t\\t\\tO Allah! If You consider that I did that for fear of you, then\\n\\t\\t\\tplease remove the rock.' So the rock shifted and they could see\\n\\t\\t\\tthe sky through it. The (third) one said, 'O Allah! You know that\\n\\t\\t\\tI had a cousin (i.e. my paternal uncle's daughter) who was most\\n\\t\\t\\tbeloved to me and I sought to seduce her, but she refused, unless\\n\\t\\t\\tI paid her one-hundred Dinars (i.e. gold pieces). So I collected\\n\\t\\t\\tthe amount and brought it to her, and she allowed me to sleep\\n\\t\\t\\twith her. But when I sat between her legs, she said, 'Be afraid\\n\\t\\t\\tof Allah, and do not deflower me but legally. 'I got up and left\\n\\t\\t\\tthe hundred Dinars (for her). O Allah! If You consider that I did\\n\\t\\t\\tthat for fear of you then please remove the rock. So Allah saved\\n\\t\\t\\tthem and they came out (of the cave).\" (This Hadith indicates\\n\\t\\t\\tthat one can only ask Allah for help directly or through his\\n\\t\\t\\tperformed good deeds. But to ask Allah through dead or absent\\n\\t\\t\\tprophets, saints, spirits, holy men, angels etc. is absolutely\\n\\t\\t\\tforbidden in Islam and it is a kind of disbelief.)\\n\\t\\t</p>"

'Ali said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"It is the Truth, and he (i.e. Muhammad) is the Apostle of Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\tSo when the morning comes, follow me, and if I should perceive\\n\\t\\t\\tany danger threatening you, I will give you a hint by pretending\\n\\t\\t\\tto go to the watercloset. But if I carried on walking, follow me\\n\\t\\t\\ttill you enter the place that I will enter.\" Abu Dhur agreed and\\n\\t\\t\\tfollowed 'Ali till he entered the place of the Prophet and Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tDhur entered with him. He then listened to the speech of the\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet and embraced Islam on that very spot. The Prophet said to\\n\\t\\t\\thim, \"Go back to your people and inform them (of this religion)\\n\\t\\t\\ttill you receive my (further) orders.\" Abu Dhur said, \"By Him in\\n\\t\\t\\tWhose Hands my life is! I will proclaim my conversion to Islam\\n\\t\\t\\tpublicly amongst them (i.e. infidels).\" He went out till he\\n\\t\\t\\treached the mosque and announced as loudly as possible, \"I\\n\\t\\t\\ttestify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.\" The people then got up\\n\\t\\t\\tand beat him till they knocked him down. Al-Abbas came and threw\\n\\t\\t\\thimself over him (to protect him) saying, \"Woe to you! Don't you\\n\\t\\t\\tknow that he is from Ghifar and there is the route (road) to your\\n\\t\\t\\tmerchants towards Sham (i.e. through the place where this tribe\\n\\t\\t\\tdwells)?\" Thus he saved him from them. Abu Dhar did the same on\\n\\t\\t\\tthe next day and the people beat him again and Al-'Abbas drew\\n\\t\\t\\thimself over him (to save him as before).\\n\\t\\t</p>"

We heard that a man had\\n\\t\\t\\tappeared in Mecca, claiming to be a Prophet. I said to my\\n\\t\\t\\tbrother, 'Go to that man and talk to him and bring me his news.'\\n\\t\\t\\tHe set out, met him and returned. I asked him, 'What is the news\\n\\t\\t\\twith you?' He said, 'By Allah, I saw a man enjoining what is good\\n\\t\\t\\tand forbidding what is evil.' I said to him, 'You have not\\n\\t\\t\\tsatisfied me with this little information.' So, I took a\\n\\t\\t\\twaterskin and a stick and proceeded towards Mecca. Neither did I\\n\\t\\t\\tknow him (i.e. the Prophet ), nor did I like to ask anyone about\\n\\t\\t\\thim. I kept on drinking Zam-zam water and staying in the mosque.\\n\\t\\t\\tThen 'Ali passed by me and said, 'It seems you are a stranger?' I\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'Yes.' He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him.\\n\\t\\t\\tNeither did he ask me anything, nor did I tell him anything. Next\\n\\t\\t\\tmorning I went to the mosque to ask about the Prophet but no one\\n\\t\\t\\ttold me anything about him. 'Ali passed by me again and asked,\\n\\t\\t\\t'Hasn't the man recognized his dwelling place yet?' I said, 'No.'\\n\\t\\t\\tHe said, 'Come along with me.' He asked me, 'What is your\\n\\t\\t\\tbusiness? What has brought you to this town?' I said to him, 'If\\n\\t\\t\\tyou keep my secret, I will tell you.' He said, 'I will do,' I\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid to him, 'We have heard that a person has appeared here,\\n\\t\\t\\tclaiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother to speak to him and\\n\\t\\t\\twhen he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I\\n\\t\\t\\tthought of meeting him personally.' 'Ali said (to Abu Dhar), 'You\\n\\t\\t\\thave reached your goal; I am going to him just now, so follow me,\\n\\t\\t\\tand wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who\\n\\t\\t\\tmay cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to\\n\\t\\t\\tmend my shoes (as a warning), and you should go away then.' 'Ali\\n\\t\\t\\tproceeded and I accompanied him till he entered a place, and I\\n\\t\\t\\tentered with him to the Prophet to whom I said, 'Present (the\\n\\t\\t\\tprinciples of) Islam to me.' When he did, I embraced Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t'immediately. He said to me, 'O Abu Dhar! Keep your conversion as\\n\\t\\t\\ta secret and return to your town; and when you hear of our\\n\\t\\t\\tvictory, return to us. ' I said, 'By Him Who has sent you with\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Truth, I will announce my conversion to Islam publicly\\n\\t\\t\\tamongst them (i.e. the infidels),' Abu Dhar went to the mosque,\\n\\t\\t\\twhere some people from Quraish were present, and said, 'O folk of\\n\\t\\t\\tQuraish! I testify that none has the right to be worshipped\\n\\t\\t\\texcept Allah, and I (also) testify that Muhammad is Allah's Slave\\n\\t\\t\\tand His Apostle.' (Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, 'Get at\\n\\t\\t\\tthis Sabi (i.e. Muslim)!' They got up and beat me nearly to\\n\\t\\t\\tdeath. Al 'Abbas saw me and threw himself over me to protect me.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe then faced them and said, 'Woe to you! You want to kill a man\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your\\n\\t\\t\\tcommunications are through the territory of Ghifar?' They\\n\\t\\t\\ttherefore left me. The next morning I returned (to the Mosque)\\n\\t\\t\\tand said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'Get at this Sabi!' I was treated in the same way as on the\\n\\t\\t\\tprevious day, and again Al-Abbas found me and threw himself over\\n\\t\\t\\tme to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore.'
