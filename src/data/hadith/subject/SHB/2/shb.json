The Prophet would\\n\\t\\t\\tsay: \"Ma sha'a-llah\" (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, \"What\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah wished,\" and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked\\n\\t\\t\\tus whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the\\n\\t\\t\\tnegative. The Prophet said, \"But I had seen (a dream) last night\\n\\t\\t\\tthat two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and\\n\\t\\t\\tanother standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside\\n\\t\\t\\tthe mouth of the former till it reached the jawbone, and then\\n\\t\\t\\ttore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the\\n\\t\\t\\tother side; in the meantime the first side of his cheek became\\n\\t\\t\\tnormal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'What is this?' They told me to proceed on and we went on\\n\\t\\t\\ttill we came to a man lying flat on his back, and another man\\n\\t\\t\\tstanding at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and\\n\\t\\t\\tcrushing the head of the lying man, with that stone. Whenever he\\n\\t\\t\\tstruck him, the stone rolled away. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThe man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man\\n\\t\\t\\tcame back and struck him again (and so on). I said, 'Who is\\n\\t\\t\\tthis?' They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed\\n\\t\\t\\tby a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and\\n\\t\\t\\tthe fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the\\n\\t\\t\\tfire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent\\n\\t\\t\\tthat they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got\\n\\t\\t\\tquieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men\\n\\t\\t\\tand women in it. I said, 'Who is this?' They told me to proceed\\n\\t\\t\\ton. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man\\n\\t\\t\\twas in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones\\n\\t\\t\\tin front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever\\n\\t\\t\\tthe man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a\\n\\t\\t\\tstone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original\\n\\t\\t\\tposition; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would\\n\\t\\t\\tthrow a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original\\n\\t\\t\\tposition. I asked, 'What is this?' They told me to proceed on and\\n\\t\\t\\twe did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a\\n\\t\\t\\thuge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some\\n\\t\\t\\tchildren. (I saw) another man near the tree with fire in front of\\n\\t\\t\\thim and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions)\\n\\t\\t\\tmade me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than\\n\\t\\t\\twhich I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men,\\n\\t\\t\\twomen and children. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree\\n\\t\\t\\tand made me enter another house that was better and superior (to\\n\\t\\t\\tthe first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e.\\n\\t\\t\\tmy two companions), 'You have made me ramble all the night. Tell\\n\\t\\t\\tme all about that I have seen.' They said, 'Yes. As for the one\\n\\t\\t\\twhose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to\\n\\t\\t\\ttell lies, and the people would report those lies on his\\n\\t\\t\\tauthority till they spread all over the world.

And those\\n\\t\\t\\tyou saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba (usury).\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was\\n\\t\\t\\tAbraham and the little children around him were the offspring of\\n\\t\\t\\tthe people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the\\n\\t\\t\\tgatekeeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you\\n\\t\\t\\thave gone was the house of the common believers, and the second\\n\\t\\t\\thouse was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise\\n\\t\\t\\tyour head.' I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over\\n\\t\\t\\tme. They said, 'That is your place.' I said, 'Let me enter my\\n\\t\\t\\tplace.' They said, 'You still have some life which you have not\\n\\t\\t\\tyet completed, and when you complete (that remaining portion of\\n\\t\\t\\tyour life) you will then enter your place.' \" \\n\\t\\t</p>"
