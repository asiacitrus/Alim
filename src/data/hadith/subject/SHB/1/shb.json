He used to go in seclusion in\\n\\t\\t\\tthe cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone)\\n\\t\\t\\tcontinuously for many days before his desire to see his family.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then\\n\\t\\t\\tcome back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food likewise again\\n\\t\\t\\ttill suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the\\n\\t\\t\\tcave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet replied, \"I do not know how to read.\"\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Prophet added, \"The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed\\n\\t\\t\\tme so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me\\n\\t\\t\\tand again asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to\\n\\t\\t\\tread.' Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time\\n\\t\\t\\ttill I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again\\n\\t\\t\\tasked me to read but again I replied, 'I do not know how to read\\n\\t\\t\\t(or what shall I read)?' Thereupon he caught me for the third\\n\\t\\t\\ttime and pressed me, and then released me and said, 'Read in the\\n\\t\\t\\tname of your Lord, who has created (all that exists) has created\\n\\t\\t\\tman from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t(96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah's Apostle returned with the\\n\\t\\t\\tInspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went to\\n\\t\\t\\tKhadija bint Khuwailid and said, \"Cover me! Cover me!\" They\\n\\t\\t\\tcovered him till his fear was over and after that he told her\\n\\t\\t\\teverything that had happened and said, \"I fear that something may\\n\\t\\t\\thappen to me.\" Khadija replied, \"Never! By Allah, Allah will\\n\\t\\t\\tnever disgrace you. You keep good relations with your kith and\\n\\t\\t\\tkin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests\\n\\t\\t\\tgenerously and assist the deserving calamity-afflicted ones.\"\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tKhadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin\\n\\t\\t\\tAsad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the Pre-Islamic Period became\\n\\t\\t\\ta Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He\\n\\t\\t\\twould write from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him\\n\\t\\t\\tto write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid to Waraqa, \"Listen to the story of your nephew, O my\\n\\t\\t\\tcousin!\" Waraqa asked, \"O my nephew! What have you seen?\" Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, \"This is the\\n\\t\\t\\tsame one who keeps the secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had\\n\\t\\t\\tsent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time\\n\\t\\t\\twhen your people would turn you out.\" Allah's Apostle asked,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"Will they drive me out?\" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you\\n\\t\\t\\thave brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain\\n\\t\\t\\talive till the day when you will be turned out then I would\\n\\t\\t\\tsupport you strongly.\" But after a few days Waraqa died and the\\n\\t\\t\\tDivine Inspiration was also paused for a while.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tJabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari narrated while talking about the\\n\\t\\t\\tperiod of pause in revelation reporting the speech of the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\"While I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the\\n\\t\\t\\tsky. I looked up and saw the same angel who had visited me at the\\n\\t\\t\\tcave of Hira sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I\\n\\t\\t\\tgot afraid of him and came back home and said, 'Wrap me (in\\n\\t\\t\\tblankets).'

Arise and warn\\n\\t\\t\\t(the people against Allah's Punishment),...' up to 'and desert\\n\\t\\t\\tthe idols.'

                "text": "<p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAbu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that Heraclius had sent a\\n\\t\\t\\tmessenger to him while he had been accompanying a caravan from\\n\\t\\t\\tQuraish. They were merchants doing business in Sham (Syria,\\n\\t\\t\\tPalestine, Lebanon, and Jordan), at the time when Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\thad truce with Abu Sufyan and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and\\n\\t\\t\\this companions went to Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius\\n\\t\\t\\tcalled them in the court and he had all the senior Roman\\n\\t\\t\\tdignitaries around him. He called for his translator who,\\n\\t\\t\\ttranslating Heraclius's question said to them, \"Who amongst you\\n\\t\\t\\tis closely related to that man who claims to be a Prophet?\" Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tSufyan replied, \"I am the nearest relative to him (amongst the\\n\\t\\t\\tgroup).\"\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tHeraclius said, \"Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanions stand behind him.\" Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told\\n\\t\\t\\this translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some\\n\\t\\t\\tquestions to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I\\n\\t\\t\\ttold a lie they (my companions) should contradict me.\" Abu Sufyan\\n\\t\\t\\tadded, \"By Allah! Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling\\n\\t\\t\\tme a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about the Prophet.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe first question he asked me about him was:\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t'What is his family status amongst you?' \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tI replied, 'He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.' \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tHeraclius further asked, 'Has anybody amongst you ever claimed\\n\\t\\t\\tthe same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tI replied, 'No.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tHe said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tI replied, 'No.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tHeraclius asked, 'Do the nobles or the poor follow him?'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tI replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tHe said, 'Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tI replied, 'They are increasing.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tHe then asked, 'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his\\n\\t\\t\\treligion become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tI replied, 'No.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tHeraclius said, 'Have you ever accused him of telling lies before\\n\\t\\t\\this claim (to be a Prophet)?'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tI replied, 'No.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tHeraclius said, 'Does he break his promises?'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tI replied, 'No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what\\n\\t\\t\\the will do in it.' I could not find opportunity to say anything\\n\\t\\t\\tagainst him except that.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tHeraclius asked, 'Have you ever had a war with him?'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tI replied, 'Yes.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen he said, 'What was the outcome of the battles?'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tI replied, 'Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tHeraclius said, 'What does he order you to do?'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tI said, 'He tells us to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to\\n\\t\\t\\tworship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our\\n\\t\\t\\tancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to\\n\\t\\t\\tbe chaste and to keep good relations with our kith and kin.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tHeraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I\\n\\t\\t\\tasked you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to\\n\\t\\t\\ta very noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble\\n\\t\\t\\tfamilies amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you\\n\\t\\t\\twhether anybody else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply\\n\\t\\t\\twas in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I\\n\\t\\t\\twould have thought that this man was following the previous man's\\n\\t\\t\\tstatement. Then I asked you whether anyone of his ancestors was a\\n\\t\\t\\tking. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had been in the\\n\\t\\t\\taffirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted to take\\n\\t\\t\\tback his ancestral kingdom.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tI further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative.\\n\\t\\t\\tSo I wondered how a person who does not tell a lie about others\\n\\t\\t\\tcould ever tell a lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the\\n\\t\\t\\trich people followed him or the poor. You replied that it was the\\n\\t\\t\\tpoor who followed him. And in fact all the Apostle have been\\n\\t\\t\\tfollowed by this very class of people. Then I asked you whether\\n\\t\\t\\this followers were increasing or decreasing. You replied that\\n\\t\\t\\tthey were increasing, and in fact this is the way of true faith,\\n\\t\\t\\ttill it is complete in all respects. I further asked you whether\\n\\t\\t\\tthere was anybody, who, after embracing his religion, became\\n\\t\\t\\tdispleased and discarded his  religion. Your reply was in the\\n\\t\\t\\tnegative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when its\\n\\t\\t\\tdelight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked\\n\\t\\t\\tyou whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and\\n\\t\\t\\tlikewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he\\n\\t\\t\\tordered you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah and Allah alone and not to worship any thing along with Him\\n\\t\\t\\tand forbade you to worship idols and ordered you to pray, to\\n\\t\\t\\tspeak the truth and to be chaste. If what you have said is true,\\n\\t\\t\\the will very soon occupy this place underneath my feet and I knew\\n\\t\\t\\tit (from the scriptures) that he was going to appear but I did\\n\\t\\t\\tnot know that he would be from you, and if I could reach him\\n\\t\\t\\tdefinitely, I would go immediately to meet him and if I were with\\n\\t\\t\\thim, I would certainly wash his feet.' Heraclius then asked for\\n\\t\\t\\tthe letter addressed by Allah's Apostle which was delivered by\\n\\t\\t\\tDihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded it to Heraclius to\\n\\t\\t\\tread. The contents of the letter were as follows: \"In the name of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad\\n\\t\\t\\tthe slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the ruler of\\n\\t\\t\\tByzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path.\\n\\t\\t\\tFurthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you\\n\\t\\t\\twill be safe, and Allah will double your reward, and if you\\n\\t\\t\\treject this invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by\\n\\t\\t\\tmisguiding your Arisiyin (peasants). (And I recite to you Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tStatement:)\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t'O people of the scripture! Come to a word common to you and us\\n\\t\\t\\tthat we worship none but Allah and that we associate nothing in\\n\\t\\t\\tworship with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords\\n\\t\\t\\tbeside Allah. Then, if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we\\n\\t\\t\\tare Muslims (those who have surrendered to Allah).' (3.64).\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAbu Sufyan then added, \"When Heraclius had finished his speech\\n\\t\\t\\tand had read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the\\n\\t\\t\\tRoyal Court. So we were turned out of the court. I told my\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanions that the question of Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\tMuhammad) has become so prominent that even the King of Bani\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of him. Then I started to become\\n\\t\\t\\tsure that he (the Prophet) would be the conqueror in the near\\n\\t\\t\\tfuture till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allah guided me to it).\"\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThe sub narrator adds, \"Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of Ilya'\\n\\t\\t\\t(Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham.\\n\\t\\t\\tIbn An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting\\n\\t\\t\\tIlya' (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some\\n\\t\\t\\tof his priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a\\n\\t\\t\\tforeteller and an astrologer. He replied, 'At night when I looked\\n\\t\\t\\tat the stars, I saw that the leader of those who practice\\n\\t\\t\\tcircumcision had appeared (become the conqueror). Who are they\\n\\t\\t\\twho practice circumcision?' The people replied, 'Except the Jews\\n\\t\\t\\tnobody practices circumcision, so you should not be afraid of\\n\\t\\t\\tthem (Jews).\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t'Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWhile they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of\\n\\t\\t\\tGhassan to convey the news of Allah's Apostle to Heraclius was\\n\\t\\t\\tbrought in. Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople to go and see whether the messenger of Ghassan was\\n\\t\\t\\tcircumcised. The people, after seeing him, told Heraclius that he\\n\\t\\t\\twas circumcised. Heraclius then asked him about the Arabs. The\\n\\t\\t\\tmessenger replied, 'Arabs also practice circumcision.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t(After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the\\n\\t\\t\\tArabs had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend\\n\\t\\t\\tin Rome who was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then\\n\\t\\t\\tleft for Homs (a town in Syria) and stayed there till he received\\n\\t\\t\\tthe reply of his letter from his friend who agreed with him in\\n\\t\\t\\this opinion about the emergence of the Prophet and the fact that\\n\\t\\t\\the was a Prophet. On that Heraclius invited all the heads of the\\n\\t\\t\\tByzantines to assemble in his palace at Homs. When they\\n\\t\\t\\tassembled, he ordered that all the doors of his palace be closed.\\n\\t\\t\\tThen he came out and said, 'O Byzantines! If success is your\\n\\t\\t\\tdesire and if you seek right guidance and want your empire to\\n\\t\\t\\tremain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet (i.e.\\n\\t\\t\\tembrace Islam).'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t(On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the\\n\\t\\t\\tgates of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed.\\n\\t\\t\\tHeraclius realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost\\n\\t\\t\\tthe hope of their embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be\\n\\t\\t\\tbrought back in audience.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t(When they returned) he said, 'What already said was just to test\\n\\t\\t\\tthe strength of your conviction and I have seen it.' The people\\n\\t\\t\\tprostrated before him and became pleased with him, and this was\\n\\t\\t\\tthe end of Heraclius's story (in connection with his faith).\\n\\t\\t</p>"

How can I meet him?\" Allah said: Take a fish in\\n\\t\\t\\ta large basket (and proceed) and you will find him at the place\\n\\t\\t\\twhere you will lose the fish. So Moses set out along with his\\n\\t\\t\\t(servant) boy, Yusha' bin Nuin and carried a fish in a large\\n\\t\\t\\tbasket till they reached a rock, where they laid their heads\\n\\t\\t\\t(i.e. lay down) and slept.

So they went back\\n\\t\\t\\tretracing their footsteps, till they reached the rock. There they\\n\\t\\t\\tsaw a man covered with a garment (or covering himself with his\\n\\t\\t\\town garment).

There is nothing sweeter than sleep\\n\\t\\t\\tfor a traveler in the last part of the night. So it was only the\\n\\t\\t\\theat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake up\\n\\t\\t\\twas so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator\\n\\t\\t\\t'Auf said that Abu Raja' had told him their names but he had\\n\\t\\t\\tforgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was 'Umar bin\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to sleep, nobody would\\n\\t\\t\\twake up him till he himself used to get up as we did not know\\n\\t\\t\\twhat was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So,\\n\\t\\t\\t'Umar got up and saw the condition of the people, and he was a\\n\\t\\t\\tstrict man, so he said, \"Allahu Akbar\" and raised his voice with\\n\\t\\t\\tTakbir, and kept on saying loudly till the Prophet got up because\\n\\t\\t\\tof it. When he got up, the people informed him about what had\\n\\t\\t\\thappened to them. He said, \"There is no harm (or it will not be\\n\\t\\t\\tharmful). Depart!\" So they departed from that place, and after\\n\\t\\t\\tcovering some distance the Prophet stopped and asked for some\\n\\t\\t\\twater to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and\\n\\t\\t\\tthe call for the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer. After he finished from the prayer, he saw a man sitting\\n\\t\\t\\taloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, \"O so and so!\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat has prevented you from praying with us?\" He replied, \"I am\\n\\t\\t\\tJunub and there is no water.\" The Prophet said, \"Perform Tayammum\\n\\t\\t\\twith (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you.\"\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen the Prophet proceeded on and the people complained to him of\\n\\t\\t\\tthirst. Thereupon he got down and called a person (the narrator\\n\\t\\t\\t'Auf added that Abu Raja' had named him but he had forgotten) and\\n\\t\\t\\t'Ali, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in\\n\\t\\t\\tsearch of water and met a woman who was sitting on her camel\\n\\t\\t\\tbetween two bags of water. They asked, \"Where can we find water?\"\\n\\t\\t\\tShe replied, \"I was there (at the place of water) this hour\\n\\t\\t\\tyesterday and my people are behind me.\" They requested her to\\n\\t\\t\\taccompany them.

So\\n\\t\\t\\tcome along.\" They brought her to the Prophet and narrated the\\n\\t\\t\\twhole story. He said, \"Help her to dismount.\" The Prophet asked\\n\\t\\t\\tfor a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured some\\n\\t\\t\\twater into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags\\n\\t\\t\\tand opened the small ones and the people were called upon to\\n\\t\\t\\tdrink and water their animals. So they all watered their animals\\n\\t\\t\\tand they (too) all quenched their thirst and also gave water to\\n\\t\\t\\tothers and last of all the Prophet gave a pot full of water to\\n\\t\\t\\tthe person who was Junub and told him to pour it over his body.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe woman was standing and watching all that they were doing with\\n\\t\\t\\ther water. By Allah, when her water bags were returned they\\n\\t\\t\\tlooked like as if they were more full (of water) than they had\\n\\t\\t\\tbeen before (Miracle of Allah's Apostle). Then the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\tordered us to collect something for her; so dates, flour and\\n\\t\\t\\tSawiq were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put\\n\\t\\t\\tin a piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that\\n\\t\\t\\tcloth full of foodstuff was also placed in front of her and then\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet said to her, \"We have not taken your water but Allah\\n\\t\\t\\thas given water to us.\" She returned home late.

(So I\\n\\t\\t\\twent back to Allah and requested for reduction) and He reduced it\\n\\t\\t\\tto half. When I passed by Moses again and informed him about it,\\n\\t\\t\\the said, 'Go back to your Lord as your followers will not be able\\n\\t\\t\\tto bear it.' So I returned to Allah and requested for further\\n\\t\\t\\treduction and half of it was reduced. I again passed by Moses and\\n\\t\\t\\the said to me: 'Return to your Lord, for your followers will not\\n\\t\\t\\tbe able to bear it.

He will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the\\n\\t\\t\\tmost wretched, amongst Your creatures.' Allah will say, 'If this\\n\\t\\t\\trequest is granted, will you then ask for anything else?'
