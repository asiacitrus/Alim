As soon as he said Takbir, I\\n\\t\\t\\theard him saying, \"The dog has killed or eaten me,\" at the time\\n\\t\\t\\the (i.e. the murderer) stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel proceeded\\n\\t\\t\\ton carrying a double-edged knife and stabbing all the persons he\\n\\t\\t\\tpassed by on the right and left (till) he stabbed thirteen\\n\\t\\t\\tpersons out of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that,\\n\\t\\t\\the threw a cloak on him. Realizing that he had been captured, the\\n\\t\\t\\tnon-Arab infidel killed himself.

Subhan Allah! (i.e. Glorified be Allah).\"\\n\\t\\t\\tAbdur-Rahman bin Auf led the people a short prayer. When they\\n\\t\\t\\tfinished the prayer, 'Umar said, \"O Ibn 'Abbas! Find out who\\n\\t\\t\\tattacked me.\" Ibn 'Abbas kept on looking here and there for a\\n\\t\\t\\tshort time and came to say. \"The slave of Al Mughira.\" On that\\n\\t\\t\\t'Umar said, \"The craftsman?\" Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Yes.\" 'Umar said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"May Allah curse him. I did not treat him unjustly. All the\\n\\t\\t\\tpraises are for Allah Who has not Caused me to die at the hand of\\n\\t\\t\\ta man who claims himself to be a Muslim.

He said to her, \"'Umar bin Al-Khattab is\\n\\t\\t\\tpaying his salutations to you, and asks the permission to be\\n\\t\\t\\tburied with his two companions.\" She said, \"I had the idea of\\n\\t\\t\\thaving this place for myself, but today I prefer 'Umar to\\n\\t\\t\\tmyself.\" When he returned it was said (to 'Umar), \"'Abdullah bin\\n\\t\\t\\t'Umar has come.\" 'Umar said, \"Make me sit up.\" Somebody supported\\n\\t\\t\\thim against his body and 'Umar asked ('Abdullah), \"What news do\\n\\t\\t\\tyou have?\" He said, \"O chief of the believers! It is as you wish.\\n\\t\\t\\tShe has given the permission.\" 'Umar said, \"Praise be to Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere was nothing more important to me than this. So when I die,\\n\\t\\t\\ttake me, and greet 'Aisha and say: \"Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the\\n\\t\\t\\tpermission (to be buried with the Prophet), and if she gives the\\n\\t\\t\\tpermission, bury me there, and if she refuses, then take me to\\n\\t\\t\\tthe grave-yard of the Muslims.\" \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen Hafsa (the mother of the believers) came with many other\\n\\t\\t\\twomen walking with her. When we saw her, we went away. She went\\n\\t\\t\\tin (to 'Umar) and wept there for sometime. When the men asked for\\n\\t\\t\\tpermission to enter, she went into another place, and we heard\\n\\t\\t\\ther weeping inside. The people said (to 'Umar), \"O chief of the\\n\\t\\t\\tbelievers! Appoint a successor.\" Umar said, \"I do not find anyone\\n\\t\\t\\tmore suitable for the job than the following persons or group\\n\\t\\t\\twhom Allah's Apostle had been pleased with before he died.\" Then\\n\\t\\t\\t'Umar mentioned 'Ali, 'Uthman, AzZubair, Talha, Sad and\\n\\t\\t\\t'Abdur-Rahman (bin Auf) and said, \"Abdullah bin 'Umar will be a\\n\\t\\t\\twitness to you, but he will have no share in the rule. His being\\n\\t\\t\\ta witness will compensate him for not sharing the right of\\n\\t\\t\\truling. If Sad becomes the ruler, it will be alright: otherwise,\\n\\t\\t\\twhoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have not\\n\\t\\t\\tdismissed him beCause of disability or dishonesty.\" 'Umar added,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"I recommend that my successor takes care of the early emigrants;\\n\\t\\t\\tto know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tI also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in\\n\\t\\t\\tMedina before the emigrants and belief had entered their hearts\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore them. I recommend that the (ruler) should accept the good\\n\\t\\t\\tof the righteous among them and excuse their wrong-doers, and I\\n\\t\\t\\trecommend that he should do good to all the people of the towns\\n\\t\\t\\t(Al-Ansar), as they are the protectors of Islam and the source of\\n\\t\\t\\twealth and the source of annoyance to the enemy. I also recommend\\n\\t\\t\\tthat nothing be taken from them except from their surplus with\\n\\t\\t\\ttheir consent. I also recommend that he do good to the 'Arab\\n\\t\\t\\tbedouin, as they are the origin of the 'Arabs and the material of\\n\\t\\t\\tIslam. He should take from what is inferior, amongst their\\n\\t\\t\\tproperties and distribute that to the poor amongst them. I also\\n\\t\\t\\trecommend him concerning Allah's and His Apostle's protectees\\n\\t\\t\\t(i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to fight for them\\n\\t\\t\\tand not to overburden them with what is beyond their ability.\" So\\n\\t\\t\\twhen 'Umar expired, we carried him out and set out walking.\\n\\t\\t\\t'Abdullah bin 'Umar greeted ('Aisha) and said, \"'Umar bin\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Khattab asks for the permission.\" 'Aisha said, \"Bring him in.\"\\n\\t\\t\\tHe was brought in and buried beside his two companions. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen he was buried, the group (recommended by 'Umar) held a\\n\\t\\t\\tmeeting. Then 'Abdur-Rahman said, \" Reduce the candidates for\\n\\t\\t\\trulership to three of you.\" Az-Zubair said, \"I give up my right\\n\\t\\t\\tto Ali.\" Talha said, \"I give up my right to 'Uthman,\" Sad, 'I\\n\\t\\t\\tgive up my right to 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf.\" 'Abdur-Rahman then\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid (to 'Uthman and 'Ali), \"Now which of you is willing to give\\n\\t\\t\\tup his right of candidacy to that he may choose the better of the\\n\\t\\t\\t(remaining) two, bearing in mind that Allah and Islam will be his\\n\\t\\t\\twitnesses.\" So both the sheiks (i.e. 'Uthman and 'Ali) kept\\n\\t\\t\\tsilent. 'Abdur-Rahman said, \"Will you both leave this matter to\\n\\t\\t\\tme, and I take Allah as my Witness that I will not choose but the\\n\\t\\t\\tbetter of you?\" They said, \"Yes.\" So 'Abdur-Rahman took the hand\\n\\t\\t\\tof one of them (i.e. 'Ali) and said, \"You are related to Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle and one of the earliest Muslims as you know well. So I\\n\\t\\t\\task you by Allah to promise that if I select you as a ruler you\\n\\t\\t\\twill do justice, and if I select 'Uthman as a ruler you will\\n\\t\\t\\tlisten to him and obey him.\" Then he took the other (i.e.\\n\\t\\t\\t'Uthman) aside and said the same to him. When 'Abdur-Rahman\\n\\t\\t\\tsecured (their agreement to) this covenant, he said, \"O 'Uthman!\\n\\t\\t\\tRaise your hand.\" So he (i.e. 'Abdur-Rahman) gave him (i.e.\\n\\t\\t\\t'Uthman) the solemn pledge, and then 'Ali gave him the pledge of\\n\\t\\t\\tallegiance and then all the (Medina) people gave him the pledge\\n\\t\\t\\tof allegiance.\\n\\t\\t</p>"

When the\\n\\t\\t\\tMuslims were put to test (i.e. troubled by the pagans), Abu Bakr\\n\\t\\t\\tset out migrating to the land of Ethiopia, and when he reached\\n\\t\\t\\tBark-al-Ghimad, Ibn Ad-Daghina, the chief of the tribe of Qara,\\n\\t\\t\\tmet him and said, \"O Abu Bakr! Where are you going?\" Abu Bakr\\n\\t\\t\\treplied, \"My people have turned me out (of my country), so I want\\n\\t\\t\\tto wander on the earth and worship my Lord.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"O Abu Bakr! A man like you should not leave his home-land, nor\\n\\t\\t\\tshould he be driven out, beCause you help the destitute, earn\\n\\t\\t\\ttheir livings, and you keep good relations with your kith and\\n\\t\\t\\tkin, help the weak and poor, entertain guests generously, and\\n\\t\\t\\thelp the calamity-stricken persons. Therefore I am your\\n\\t\\t\\tprotector. Go back and worship your Lord in your town.\" \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tSo Abu Bakr returned and Ibn Ad-Daghina accompanied him. In the\\n\\t\\t\\tevening Ibn Ad-Daghina visited the nobles of Quraish and said to\\n\\t\\t\\tthem, \"A man like Abu Bakr should not leave his homeland, nor\\n\\t\\t\\tshould he be driven out. Do you (i.e. Quraish) drive out a man\\n\\t\\t\\twho helps the destitute, earns their living, keeps good relations\\n\\t\\t\\twith his kith and kin, helps the weak and poor, entertains guests\\n\\t\\t\\tgenerously and helps the calamity-stricken persons?\" So the\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople of Quraish could not refuse Ibn Ad-Daghina's protection,\\n\\t\\t\\tand they said to Ibn Ad-Daghina, \"Let Abu Bakr worship his Lord\\n\\t\\t\\tin his house. He can pray and recite there whatever he likes, but\\n\\t\\t\\the should not hurt us with it, and should not do it publicly,\\n\\t\\t\\tbeCause we are afraid that he may affect our women and children.\"\\n\\t\\t\\tIbn Ad-Daghina told Abu Bakr of all that. Abu Bakr stayed in that\\n\\t\\t\\tstate, worshipping his Lord in his house. He did not pray\\n\\t\\t\\tpublicly, nor did he recite Qur'an outside his house. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen a thought occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in front of\\n\\t\\t\\this house, and there he used to pray and recite the Qur'an. The\\n\\t\\t\\twomen and children of the pagans began to gather around him in\\n\\t\\t\\tgreat number. They used to wonder at him and look at him. Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tBakr was a man who used to weep too much, and he could not help\\n\\t\\t\\tweeping on reciting the Qur'an. That situation scared the nobles\\n\\t\\t\\tof the pagans of Quraish, so they sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When\\n\\t\\t\\the came to them, they said, \"We accepted your protection of Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tBakr on condition that he should worship his Lord in his house,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut he has violated the conditions and he has built a mosque in\\n\\t\\t\\tfront of his house where he prays and recites the Qur'an\\n\\t\\t\\tpublicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and\\n\\t\\t\\tchildren unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to\\n\\t\\t\\tconfine the worship of his Lord to his house, he may do so, but\\n\\t\\t\\tif he insists on doing that openly, ask him to release you from\\n\\t\\t\\tyour obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact\\n\\t\\t\\twith you, but we deny Abu Bakr the right to announce his act\\n\\t\\t\\tpublicly.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina went to Abu- Bakr and said, (\"O Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tBakr!) You know well what contract I have made on your behalf;\\n\\t\\t\\tnow, you are either to abide by it, or else release me from my\\n\\t\\t\\tobligation of protecting you, beCause I do not want the 'Arabs to\\n\\t\\t\\thear that my people have dishonored a contract I have made on\\n\\t\\t\\tbehalf of another man.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"I release you from\\n\\t\\t\\tyour pact to protect me, and am pleased with the protection from\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah.\" \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAt that time the Prophet was in Mecca, and he said to the\\n\\t\\t\\tMuslims, \"In a dream I have been shown your migration place, a\\n\\t\\t\\tland of date palm trees, between two mountains, the two stony\\n\\t\\t\\ttracts.\" So, some people migrated to Medina, and most of those\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia,\\n\\t\\t\\treturned to Medina. Abu Bakr also prepared to leave for Medina,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut Allah's Apostle said to him, \"Wait for a while, beCause I\\n\\t\\t\\thope that I will be allowed to migrate also.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Do\\n\\t\\t\\tyou indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed for you!\" The\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet said, \"Yes.\" So Abu Bakr did not migrate for the sake of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle in order to accompany him. He fed two she-camels\\n\\t\\t\\the possessed with the leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on being\\n\\t\\t\\tstruck by a stick for four months. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tOne day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr's house at noon,\\n\\t\\t\\tsomeone said to Abu Bakr, \"This is Allah's Apostle with his head\\n\\t\\t\\tcovered coming at a time at which he never used to visit us\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore.\" Abu Bakr said, \"May my parents be sacrificed for him. By\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah, he has not come at this hour except for a great\\n\\t\\t\\tnecessity.\" So Allah's Apostle came and asked permission to\\n\\t\\t\\tenter, and he was allowed to enter. When he entered, he said to\\n\\t\\t\\tAbu Bakr. \"Tell everyone who is present with you to go away.\" Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tBakr replied, \"There are none but your family. May my father be\\n\\t\\t\\tsacrificed for you, O Allah's Apostle!\" The Prophet said, \"I have\\n\\t\\t\\tbeen given permission to migrate.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Shall I\\n\\t\\t\\taccompany you? May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle!\" Allah's Apostle said, \"Yes.\" Abu Bakr said, \"O Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle! May my father be sacrificed for you, take one of these\\n\\t\\t\\ttwo she-camels of mine.\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"(I will accept\\n\\t\\t\\tit) with payment.\" So we prepared the baggage quickly and put\\n\\t\\t\\tsome journey food in a leather bag for them. Asma, Abu Bakr's\\n\\t\\t\\tdaughter, cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of\\n\\t\\t\\tthe leather bag with it, and for that reason she was named\\n\\t\\t\\tDhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two belts). \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the mountain\\n\\t\\t\\tof Thaur and stayed there for three nights. 'Abdullah bin Abi\\n\\t\\t\\tBakr who was intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay\\n\\t\\t\\t(with them) overnight. He used to leave them before day break so\\n\\t\\t\\tthat in the morning he would be with Quraish as if he had spent\\n\\t\\t\\tthe night in Mecca. He would keep in mind any plot made against\\n\\t\\t\\tthem, and when it became dark he would (go and) inform them of\\n\\t\\t\\tit. 'Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, used to bring\\n\\t\\t\\tthe milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr) to them a little while\\n\\t\\t\\tafter nightfall in order to rest the sheep there. So they always\\n\\t\\t\\thad fresh milk at night, the milk of their sheep, and the milk\\n\\t\\t\\twhich they warmed by throwing heated stones in it. 'Amir bin\\n\\t\\t\\tFuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark\\n\\t\\t\\t(before daybreak). He did the same in each of those three nights.\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle and Abu Bakr had hired a man from the tribe of\\n\\t\\t\\tBani Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert\\n\\t\\t\\tguide, and he was in alliance with the family of Al-'As bin Wail\\n\\t\\t\\tAs-Sahmi and he was of the religion of the infidels of Quraish.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Prophet and Abu Bakr trusted him and gave him their two\\n\\t\\t\\tshe-camels and took his promise to bring their two she camels to\\n\\t\\t\\tthe cave of the mountain of Thaur in the morning after three\\n\\t\\t\\tnights later. And (when they set out), 'Amir bin Fuhaira and the\\n\\t\\t\\tguide went along with them and the guide led them along the\\n\\t\\t\\tsea-shore.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThe nephew of Suraqa bin Ju'sham said that his father informed\\n\\t\\t\\thim that he heard Suraqa bin Ju'sham saying, \"The messengers of\\n\\t\\t\\tthe heathens of Quraish came to us declaring that they had\\n\\t\\t\\tassigned for the persons why would kill or arrest Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\tand Abu Bakr, a reward equal to their bloodmoney. While I was\\n\\t\\t\\tsitting in one of the gatherings of my tribe, Bani Mudlij, a man\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom them came to us and stood up while we were sitting, and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'O Suraqa! No doubt, I have just seen some people far away\\n\\t\\t\\ton the seashore, and I think they are Muhammad and his\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanions.' \" Suraqa added, \"I too realized that it must have\\n\\t\\t\\tbeen they. But I said 'No, it is not they, but you have seen\\n\\t\\t\\tso-and-so, and so-and-so whom we saw set out.' I stayed in the\\n\\t\\t\\tgathering for a while and then got up and left for my home. and\\n\\t\\t\\tordered my slave-girl to get my horse which was behind a hillock,\\n\\t\\t\\tand keep it ready for me. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen I took my spear and left by the back door of my house\\n\\t\\t\\tdragging the lower end of the spear on the ground and keeping it\\n\\t\\t\\tlow. Then I reached my horse, mounted it and made it gallop. When\\n\\t\\t\\tI approached them (i.e. Muhammad and Abu Bakr), my horse stumbled\\n\\t\\t\\tand I fell down from it, Then I stood up, got hold of my quiver\\n\\t\\t\\tand took out the divining arrows and drew lots as to whether I\\n\\t\\t\\tshould harm them (i.e. the Prophet and Abu Bakr) or not, and the\\n\\t\\t\\tlot which I disliked came out. But I remounted my horse and let\\n\\t\\t\\tit gallop, giving no importance to the divining arrows. When I\\n\\t\\t\\theard the recitation of the Qur'an by Allah's Apostle who did not\\n\\t\\t\\tlook hither and thither while Abu Bakr was doing it often,\\n\\t\\t\\tsuddenly the forelegs of my horse sank into the ground up to the\\n\\t\\t\\tknees, and I fell down from it. Then I rebuked it and it got up\\n\\t\\t\\tbut could hardly take out its forelegs from the ground, and when\\n\\t\\t\\tit stood up straight again, its forelegs Caused dust to rise up\\n\\t\\t\\tin the sky like smoke. Then again I drew lots with the divining\\n\\t\\t\\tarrows, and the lot which I disliked, came out. So I called upon\\n\\t\\t\\tthem to feel secure. They stopped, and I remounted my horse and\\n\\t\\t\\twent to them. When I saw how I had been hampered from harming\\n\\t\\t\\tthem, it came to my mind that the Cause of Allah's Apostle (i.e.\\n\\t\\t\\tIslam) will become victorious. So I said to him, \"Your people\\n\\t\\t\\thave assigned a reward equal to the bloodmoney for your head.\"\\n\\t\\t\\tThen I told them all the plans the people of Mecca had made\\n\\t\\t\\tconcerning them. Then I offered them some journey food and goods\\n\\t\\t\\tbut they refused to take anything and did not ask for anything,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut the Prophet said, \"Do not tell others about us.\" Then I\\n\\t\\t\\trequested him to write for me a Statement of security and peace.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe ordered 'Amr bin Fuhaira who wrote it for me on a parchment,\\n\\t\\t\\tand then Allah's Apostle proceeded on his way.\"\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tNarrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair: Allah's Apostle met Az-Zubair in a\\n\\t\\t\\tcaravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Sham.\\n\\t\\t\\tAz-Zubair provided Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr with white\\n\\t\\t\\tclothes to wear. When the Muslims of Medina heard the news of the\\n\\t\\t\\tdeparture of Allah's Apostle from Mecca (towards Medina), they\\n\\t\\t\\tstarted going to the Harra every morning . They would wait for\\n\\t\\t\\thim till the heat of the noon forced them to return. One day,\\n\\t\\t\\tafter waiting for a long while, they returned home, and when they\\n\\t\\t\\twent into their houses, a Jew climbed up the roof of one of the\\n\\t\\t\\tforts of his people to look for some thing, and he saw Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle and his companions dressed in white clothes, emerging out\\n\\t\\t\\tof the desert mirage. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice, \"O you\\n\\t\\t\\t'Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!\"\\n\\t\\t\\tSo all the Muslims rushed to their arms and received Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle on the summit of Harra. The Prophet turned with them to\\n\\t\\t\\tthe right and alighted at the quarters of Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf, and\\n\\t\\t\\tthis was on Monday in the month of Rabi-ul-Awal. Abu Bakr stood\\n\\t\\t\\tup, receiving the people while Allah's Apostle sat down and kept\\n\\t\\t\\tsilent. Some of the Ansar who came and had not seen Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle before, began greeting Abu Bakr, but when the sunshine\\n\\t\\t\\tfell on Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr came forward and shaded him\\n\\t\\t\\twith his sheet only then the people came to know Allah's Apostle.\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle stayed with Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf for ten nights and\\n\\t\\t\\testablished the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was founded on\\n\\t\\t\\tpiety. Allah's Apostle prayed in it and then mounted his\\n\\t\\t\\tshe-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the people till his\\n\\t\\t\\tshe-camel knelt down at (the place of) the mosque of Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle at Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days,\\n\\t\\t\\tand that place was a yard for drying dates belonging to Suhail\\n\\t\\t\\tand Sahl, the orphan boys who were under the guardianship of\\n\\t\\t\\t'Asad bin Zurara. When his she-camel knelt down, Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"This place, Allah willing, will be our abiding place.\"\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle then called the two boys and told them to suggest\\n\\t\\t\\ta price for that yard so that he might take it as a mosque. The\\n\\t\\t\\ttwo boys said, \"No, but we will give it as a gift, O Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle!\" Allah's Apostle then built a mosque there. The Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\thimself started carrying unburnt bricks for its building and\\n\\t\\t\\twhile doing so, he was saying \"This load is better than the load\\n\\t\\t\\tof Khaibar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Allah and purer\\n\\t\\t\\tand better rewardable.\" He was also saying, \"O Allah! The actual\\n\\t\\t\\treward is the reward in the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Ansar and the Emigrants.\" Thus the Prophet recited (by way of\\n\\t\\t\\tproverb) the poem of some Muslim poet whose name is unknown to\\n\\t\\t\\tme.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t(Ibn Shibab said, \"In the Hadiths it does not occur that Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle recited a complete poetic Verse other than this one.\")\\n\\t\\t</p>"

Then Abu Bakr\\n\\t\\t\\tlooked behind and saw a horse-rider pursuing them. He said, \"O\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle! This is a horse-rider pursuing us.\" The Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\tlooked behind and said, \"O Allah! Cause him to fall down.\" So the\\n\\t\\t\\thorse threw him down and got up neighing.

While the\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet was speaking with the family members of Abu Aiyub,\\n\\t\\t\\t'Abdullah bin Salam heard the news of his arrival while he\\n\\t\\t\\thimself was picking the dates for his family from his family\\n\\t\\t\\tgarden. He hurried to the Prophet carrying the dates which he had\\n\\t\\t\\tcollected for his family from the garden. He listened to Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet and then went home. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen Allah's Prophet said, \"Which is the nearest of the houses of\\n\\t\\t\\tour kith and kin?\" Abu Aiyub replied, \"Mine, O Allah's Prophet!\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is my house and this is my gate.\" The Prophet said, \"Go and\\n\\t\\t\\tprepare a place for our midday rest.\" Abu Aiyub said, \"Get up\\n\\t\\t\\t(both of you) with Allah's Blessings.\" So when Allah's Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\twent into the house, 'Abdullah bin Salaim came and said \"I\\n\\t\\t\\ttestify that you (i.e. Muhammad) are Apostle of Allah and that\\n\\t\\t\\tyou have come with the Truth. The Jews know well that I am their\\n\\t\\t\\tchief and the son of their chief and the most learned amongst\\n\\t\\t\\tthem and the son of the most learned amongst them.

So they sent about one hundred archers after\\n\\t\\t\\tthem. The archers traced the footsteps (of the Muslims) till they\\n\\t\\t\\tfound the traces of dates which they had eaten at one of their\\n\\t\\t\\tcamping places. The archers said, \"These dates are of Yathrib\\n\\t\\t\\t(i.e. Medina),\" and went on tracing the Muslims' footsteps. When\\n\\t\\t\\t'Asim and his companions became aware of them, they took refuge\\n\\t\\t\\tin a (high) place. But the enemy encircled them and said, \"Come\\n\\t\\t\\tdown and surrender.

Khubaib remained imprisoned by\\n\\t\\t\\tthem till they decided unanimously to kill him. One day Khubaib\\n\\t\\t\\tborrowed from a daughter of Al-Harith, a razor for shaving his\\n\\t\\t\\tpubic hair, and she lent it to him. By chance, while she was\\n\\t\\t\\tinattentive, a little son of hers went to him (i.e. Khubaib) and\\n\\t\\t\\tshe saw that Khubaib had seated him on his thigh while the razor\\n\\t\\t\\twas in his hand. She was so much terrified that Khubaib noticed\\n\\t\\t\\ther fear and said, \"Are you afraid that I will kill him? Never\\n\\t\\t\\twould I do such a thing.\" Later on (while narrating the story)\\n\\t\\t\\tshe said, \"By Allah, I had never seen a better captive than\\n\\t\\t\\tKhubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating from a bunch of\\n\\t\\t\\tgrapes in his hand while he was fettered with iron chains and (at\\n\\t\\t\\tthat time) there was no fruit in Mecca.\" She used to say,\" It was\\n\\t\\t\\tfood Allah had provided Khubaib with.\" \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen they took him to Al-Hil out of Mecca sanctuary to martyr\\n\\t\\t\\thim, Khubaib requested them, \"Allow me to offer a two-Rak'at\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer.\" They allowed him and he prayed two Rakat and then said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"By Allah! Had I not been afraid that you would think I was\\n\\t\\t\\tworried, I would have prayed more.\" Then he (invoked evil upon\\n\\t\\t\\tthem) saying, \"O Allah! Count them and kill them one by one, and\\n\\t\\t\\tdo not leave anyone of them\"' Then he recited: \"As I am martyred\\n\\t\\t\\tas a Muslim, I do not care in what way I receive my death for\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's sake, for this is for the Cause of Allah. If He wishes,\\n\\t\\t\\tHe will bless the cut limbs of my body.\" Then Abu Sarva, 'Ubqa\\n\\t\\t\\tbin Al-Harith went up to him and killed him. It was Khubaib who\\n\\t\\t\\tset the tradition of praying for any Muslim to be martyred in\\n\\t\\t\\tcaptivity (before he is executed). The Prophet told his\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanions of what had happened (to those ten spies) on the same\\n\\t\\t\\tday they were martyred. Some Quraish people, being informed of\\n\\t\\t\\t'Asim bin Thabit's death, sent some messengers to bring a part of\\n\\t\\t\\this body so that his death might be known for certain, for he had\\n\\t\\t\\tpreviously killed one of their leaders (in the battle of Badr).\\n\\t\\t\\tBut Allah sent a swarm of wasps to protect the dead body of\\n\\t\\t\\t'Asim, and they shielded him from the messengers who could not\\n\\t\\t\\tcut anything from his body.\\n\\t\\t</p>"

They\\n\\t\\t\\tmade the camel rise and all of them left (along with it). I found\\n\\t\\t\\tmy necklace after the army had gone. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThen I came to their camping place to find no call maker of them,\\n\\t\\t\\tnor one who would respond to the call.

While I was sitting in my resting\\n\\t\\t\\tplace, I was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. Safwan bin\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he\\n\\t\\t\\treached my place in the morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping\\n\\t\\t\\tperson and he recognized me on seeing me as he had seen me before\\n\\t\\t\\tthe order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed). So I woke up\\n\\t\\t\\twhen he recited Istirja' (i.e. \"Inna lillahi wa inna llaihi\\n\\t\\t\\traji'un\") as soon as he recognized me. I veiled my face with my\\n\\t\\t\\thead cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single word,\\n\\t\\t\\tand I did not hear him saying any word besides his Istirja'. He\\n\\t\\t\\tdismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg\\n\\t\\t\\ton its front legs and then I got up and rode on it.

That roused my doubts, but\\n\\t\\t\\tI did not discover the evil (i.e. slander) till I went out after\\n\\t\\t\\tmy convalescence, I went out with Um Mistah to Al-Manasi' where\\n\\t\\t\\twe used to answer the call of nature and we used not to go out\\n\\t\\t\\t(to answer the call of nature) except at night, and that was\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore we had latrines near our houses.

Do you abuse a man who took part in the\\n\\t\\t\\tbattle of Badr?' On that she said, 'O you Hantah! Didn't you hear\\n\\t\\t\\twhat he (i.e. Mistah) said?'

I said, 'Subhan-Allah! (I\\n\\t\\t\\ttestify the uniqueness of Allah). Are the people really talking\\n\\t\\t\\tin this way?' I kept on weeping that night till dawn I could\\n\\t\\t\\tneither stop weeping nor sleep then in the morning again, I kept\\n\\t\\t\\ton weeping. When the Divine Inspiration was delayed, Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle called 'Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and\\n\\t\\t\\tconsult them about divorcing me. Usama bin Zaid said what he knew\\n\\t\\t\\tof my innocence, and the respect he preserved in himself for me.\\n\\t\\t\\tUsama said, '(O Allah's Apostle!) She is your wife and we do not\\n\\t\\t\\tknow anything except good about her.' 'Ali bin Abi Talib said, 'O\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle! Allah does not put you in difficulty and there\\n\\t\\t\\tare plenty of women other than she, yet, ask the maid-servant who\\n\\t\\t\\twill tell you the truth.' On that Allah's Apostle called Barira\\n\\t\\t\\t(i.e. the maid-servant) and said, 'O Barira! Did you ever see\\n\\t\\t\\tanything which aroused your suspicion?' Barira said to him, 'By\\n\\t\\t\\tHim Who has sent you with the Truth. I have never seen anything\\n\\t\\t\\tin her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal, except that she is a\\n\\t\\t\\tyoung girl who sleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so\\n\\t\\t\\tthat the domestic goats come and eat it.' \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tSo, on that day, Allah's Apostle got up on the pulpit and\\n\\t\\t\\tcomplained about 'Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul) before his\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanions, saying, 'O you Muslims! Who will relieve me from that\\n\\t\\t\\tman who has hurt me with his evil statement about my family? By\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah, I know nothing except good about my family and they have\\n\\t\\t\\tblamed a man about whom I know nothing except good and he used\\n\\t\\t\\tnever to enter my home except with me.' Sad bin Mu'adh the\\n\\t\\t\\tbrother of Banu 'Abd Al-Ashhal got up and said, 'O Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle! I will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Aus, then I will chop his head off, and if he is from our\\n\\t\\t\\tbrothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill\\n\\t\\t\\tyour order.' On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan,\\n\\t\\t\\this cousin, was from his branch tribe, and he was Sad bin Ubada,\\n\\t\\t\\tchief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut his love for his tribe goaded him into saying to Sad (bin\\n\\t\\t\\tMu'adh). 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not and cannot\\n\\t\\t\\tkill him. If he belonged to your people, you would not wish him\\n\\t\\t\\tto be killed.' \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tOn that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sad (bin Mu'adh)\\n\\t\\t\\tgot up and said to Sad bin 'Ubada, 'By Allah! You are a liar! We\\n\\t\\t\\twill surely kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the\\n\\t\\t\\tbehalf of hypocrites.' On this, the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al\\n\\t\\t\\tKhazraj got so much excited that they were about to fight while\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Apostle kept\\n\\t\\t\\ton quietening them till they became silent and so did he. All\\n\\t\\t\\tthat day I kept on weeping with my tears never ceasing, and I\\n\\t\\t\\tcould never sleep.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tIn the morning my parents were with me and I wept for two nights\\n\\t\\t\\tand a day with my tears never ceasing and I could never sleep\\n\\t\\t\\ttill I thought that my liver would burst from weeping. So, while\\n\\t\\t\\tmy parents were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari\\n\\t\\t\\twoman asked me to grant her admittance. I allowed her to come in,\\n\\t\\t\\tand when she came in, she sat down and started weeping with me.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhile we were in this state, Allah's Apostle came, greeted us and\\n\\t\\t\\tsat down. He had never sat with me since that day of the slander.\\n\\t\\t\\tA month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about\\n\\t\\t\\tmy case. Allah's Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said,\\n\\t\\t\\t'Amma Badu, O 'Aisha! I have been informed so-and-so about you;\\n\\t\\t\\tif you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your innocence,\\n\\t\\t\\tand if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him\\n\\t\\t\\tfor forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and asks\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.'\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen Allah's Apostle finished his speech, my tears ceased flowing\\n\\t\\t\\tcompletely that I no longer felt a single drop of tear flowing. I\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid to my father, 'Reply to Allah's Apostle on my behalf\\n\\t\\t\\tconcerning what he has said.' My father said, 'By Allah, I do not\\n\\t\\t\\tknow what to say to Allah's Apostle.' Then I said to my mother,\\n\\t\\t\\t'Reply to Allah's Apostle on my behalf concerning what he has\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid.' She said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle.' In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had a\\n\\t\\t\\tlittle knowledge of Qur'an, I said, 'By Allah, no doubt I know\\n\\t\\t\\tthat you heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been\\n\\t\\t\\tplanted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a\\n\\t\\t\\ttruth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe\\n\\t\\t\\tme, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am\\n\\t\\t\\tinnocent, you will surely believe me. By Allah, I find no\\n\\t\\t\\tsimilitude for me and you except that of Joseph's father when he\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, '(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which\\n\\t\\t\\tyou assert; it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' Then I\\n\\t\\t\\tturned to the other side and lay on my bed; and Allah knew then\\n\\t\\t\\tthat I was innocent and hoped that Allah would reveal my\\n\\t\\t\\tinnocence. But, by Allah, I never thought that Allah would reveal\\n\\t\\t\\tabout my case, Divine Inspiration, that would be recited\\n\\t\\t\\t(forever) as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah with something of my concern, but I hoped that Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my\\n\\t\\t\\tinnocence. But, by Allah, before Allah's Apostle left his seat\\n\\t\\t\\tand before any of the household left, the Divine Inspiration came\\n\\t\\t\\tto Allah's Apostle.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tSo there overtook him the same hard condition which used to\\n\\t\\t\\tovertake him, (when he used to be inspired Divinely). The sweat\\n\\t\\t\\twas dropping from his body like pearls though it was a wintry day\\n\\t\\t\\tand that was because of the weighty Statement which was being\\n\\t\\t\\trevealed to him. When that state of Allah's Apostle was over, he\\n\\t\\t\\tgot up smiling, and the first word he said was, 'O 'Aisha! Allah\\n\\t\\t\\thas declared your innocence!' Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up\\n\\t\\t\\tand go to him (i.e. Allah's Apostle).' I replied, 'By Allah, I\\n\\t\\t\\twill not go to him, and I praise none but Allah.' So Allah\\n\\t\\t\\trevealed the ten Verses:  'Verily! They who spread the slander\\n\\t\\t\\tAre a gang, among you...' (24.11-20) \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah revealed those Qur'anic Verses to declare my innocence. Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tBakr As-Siddiq who used to disburse money for Mistah bin Uthatha\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause of his relationship to him and his poverty, said, 'By\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah, I will never give to Mistah bin Uthatha anything after\\n\\t\\t\\twhat he has said about Aisha.' Then Allah revealed:  \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t'And let not those among you who are good and wealthy swear not\\n\\t\\t\\tto give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and\\n\\t\\t\\tthose who have left their homes for Allah's Cause, let them\\n\\t\\t\\tpardon and forgive. Do you not love that Allah should forgive\\n\\t\\t\\tyou? And Allah is oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.' (24.22) \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAbu Bakr As-Siddiq said, 'Yes, by Allah, I would like that Allah\\n\\t\\t\\tforgive me,' and went on giving Mistah the money he used to give\\n\\t\\t\\thim before. He also added, 'By Allah, I will never deprive him of\\n\\t\\t\\tit at all.' -\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAisha further said: \"Allah's Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh\\n\\t\\t\\t(i.e. his wife) about my case. He said to Zainab, 'What do you\\n\\t\\t\\tknow and what did you see?\" She replied, \"O Allah's Apostle! I\\n\\t\\t\\trefrain from claiming falsely that I have heard or seen anything.\\n\\t\\t\\tBy Allah, I know nothing except good (about 'Aisha).' From\\n\\t\\t\\tamongst the wives of the Prophet Zainab was my peer (in beauty\\n\\t\\t\\tand in the love she received from the Prophet) but Allah saved\\n\\t\\t\\ther from that evil because of her piety. Her sister Hamna,\\n\\t\\t\\tstarted struggling on her behalf and she was destroyed along with\\n\\t\\t\\tthose who were destroyed. The man who was blamed said,\\n\\t\\t\\t'Subhan-Allah! By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I have never\\n\\t\\t\\tuncovered the cover (i.e. veil) of any female.' Later on the man\\n\\t\\t\\twas martyred in Allah's Cause.\"\\n\\t\\t</p>"

And when Abu Bakr\\n\\t\\t\\tspoke, he said, \"By Him in Whose Hand my soul is to keep good\\n\\t\\t\\trelations with the relatives of Allah's Apostle is dearer to me\\n\\t\\t\\tthan to keep good relations with my own relatives. But as for the\\n\\t\\t\\ttrouble which arose between me and you about his property, I will\\n\\t\\t\\tdo my best to spend it according to what is good, and will not\\n\\t\\t\\tleave any rule or regulation which I saw Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\tfollowing, in disposing of it, but I will follow.\" On that 'Ali\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid to Abu Bakr, \"I promise to give you the oath of allegiance\\n\\t\\t\\tin this afternoon.\" So when Abu Bakr had offered the Zuhr prayer,\\n\\t\\t\\the ascended the pulpit and uttered the Tashah-hud and then\\n\\t\\t\\tmentioned the story of 'Ali and his failure to give the oath of\\n\\t\\t\\tallegiance, and excused him, accepting what excuses he had\\n\\t\\t\\toffered. Then 'Ali (got up) and praying (to Allah) for\\n\\t\\t\\tforgiveness, he uttered Tashah-hud, praised Abu Bakr's right, and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, that he had not done what he had done because of jealousy\\n\\t\\t\\tof Abu Bakr or as a protest of that Allah had favored him with.\\n\\t\\t\\t'Ali added, \"But we used to consider that we too had some right\\n\\t\\t\\tin this affair (of rulership) and that he (i.e. Abu Bakr) did not\\n\\t\\t\\tconsult us in this matter, and therefore caused us to feel\\n\\t\\t\\tsorry.\" On that all the Muslims became happy and said, \"You have\\n\\t\\t\\tdone the right thing.\" The Muslims then became friendly with 'Ali\\n\\t\\t\\tas he returned to what the people had done (i.e. giving the oath\\n\\t\\t\\tof allegiance to Abu Bakr).\\n\\t\\t</p>"

When my father returned (from the Prophet) to his tribe,\\n\\t\\t\\the said, \"By Allah, I have come to you from the Prophet for\\n\\t\\t\\tsure!\" The Prophet afterwards said to them, -Offer such-and-such\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer at such-and-such time, and when the time for the prayer\\n\\t\\t\\tbecomes due, then one of you should pronounce the Adhan (for the\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer), and let the one amongst you who knows Qur'an most should\\n\\t\\t\\tlead the prayer.\" So they looked for such a person and found none\\n\\t\\t\\twho knew more Qur'an than I because of the Qur'anic material\\n\\t\\t\\twhich I used to learn from the caravans. They therefore made me\\n\\t\\t\\ttheir Imam ((to lead the prayer) and at that time I was a boy of\\n\\t\\t\\tsix or seven years, wearing a Burda (i.e. a black square garment)\\n\\t\\t\\tproved to be very short for me (and my body became partly naked).\\n\\t\\t\\tA lady from the tribe said, \"Won't you cover the anus of your\\n\\t\\t\\treciter for us?\" So they bought (a piece of cloth) and made a\\n\\t\\t\\tshirt for me.

Kab said, \"I did not\\n\\t\\t\\tremain behind Allah's Apostle in any Ghazwa that he fought except\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed to take part in the Ghazwa of\\n\\t\\t\\tBadr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated\\n\\t\\t\\tin it, for in fact, Allah's Apostle had gone out in search of the\\n\\t\\t\\tcaravan of Quraish till Allah made them (i.e. the Muslims) and\\n\\t\\t\\ttheir enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night\\n\\t\\t\\tof Al-'Aqaba (pledge) with Allah's Apostle when we pledged for\\n\\t\\t\\tIslam, and I would not exchange it for the Badr battle although\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Badr battle is more popular amongst the people than it (i.e.\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-'Aqaba pledge). As for my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I\\n\\t\\t\\thad never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained\\n\\t\\t\\tbehind the Prophet in that Ghazwa. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tBy Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then at\\n\\t\\t\\tthe time of this Ghazwa. Whenever Allah's Apostle wanted to make\\n\\t\\t\\ta Ghazwa, he used to hide his intention by apparently referring\\n\\t\\t\\tto different Ghazwa till it was the time of that Ghazwa (of\\n\\t\\t\\tTabuk) which Allah's Apostle fought in severe heat, facing a long\\n\\t\\t\\tjourney, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\tannounced to the Muslims clearly (their destination) so that they\\n\\t\\t\\tmight get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he informed them clearly\\n\\t\\t\\tof the destination he was going to. Allah's Apostle was\\n\\t\\t\\taccompanied by a large number of Muslims who could not be listed\\n\\t\\t\\tin a book namely, a register.\" Ka'b added, \"Any man who intended\\n\\t\\t\\tto be absent would think that the matter would remain hidden\\n\\t\\t\\tunless Allah revealed it through Divine Revelation. So Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had\\n\\t\\t\\tripened and the shade looked pleasant. Allah's Apostle and his\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanions prepared for the battle and I started to go out in\\n\\t\\t\\torder to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without\\n\\t\\t\\tdoing anything. I would say to myself, 'I can do that.' So I kept\\n\\t\\t\\ton delaying it every now and then till the people got ready and\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle and the Muslims along with him departed, and I\\n\\t\\t\\thad not prepared anything for my departure, and I said, I will\\n\\t\\t\\tprepare myself (for departure) one or two days after him, and\\n\\t\\t\\tthen join them.' In the morning following their departure, I went\\n\\t\\t\\tout to get myself ready but returned having done nothing. Then\\n\\t\\t\\tagain in the next morning, I went out to get ready but returned\\n\\t\\t\\twithout doing anything. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tSuch was the case with me till they hurried away and the battle\\n\\t\\t\\twas missed (by me). Even then I intended to depart to take them\\n\\t\\t\\tover. I wish I had done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after\\n\\t\\t\\tthe departure of Allah's Apostle, whenever I went out and walked\\n\\t\\t\\tamongst the people (i.e, the remaining persons), it grieved me\\n\\t\\t\\tthat I could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or\\n\\t\\t\\tone of those weak men whom Allah had excused. Allah's Apostle did\\n\\t\\t\\tnot remember me till he reached Tabuk. So while he was sitting\\n\\t\\t\\tamongst the people in Tabuk, he said, 'What did Ka'b do?' A man\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom Banu Salama said, 'O Allah's Apostle! He has been stopped by\\n\\t\\t\\this two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his looking at his own flanks\\n\\t\\t\\twith pride.' Then Mu'adh bin Jabal said, 'What a bad thing you\\n\\t\\t\\thave said! By Allah! O Allah's Apostle! We know nothing about him\\n\\t\\t\\tbut good.' Allah's Apostle kept silent.\" Ka'b bin Malik added,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"When I heard that he (i.e. the Prophet) was on his way back to\\n\\t\\t\\tMedina, I got dipped in my concern, and began to think of false\\n\\t\\t\\texcuses, saying to myself, 'How can I avoid his anger tomorrow?'\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd I took the advice of wise member of my family in this matter.\\n\\t\\t\\tThen it was said that Allah's Apostle, had come near all the evil\\n\\t\\t\\tfalse excuses abandoned from my mind and I knew well that I could\\n\\t\\t\\tnever come out of this problem by forging a false Statement. Then\\n\\t\\t\\tI decided firmly to speak the truth. So Allah's Apostle arrived\\n\\t\\t\\tin the morning, and whenever he returned from a journey., he used\\n\\t\\t\\tto visit the mosque first of all and offer a two-Rak'at prayer\\n\\t\\t\\ttherein and then sit for the people. So when he had done all that\\n\\t\\t\\t(this time), those who had failed to join the battle (of Tabuk)\\n\\t\\t\\tcame and started offering (false) excuses and taking oaths before\\n\\t\\t\\thim. They were something over eighty men; Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\taccepted the excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of\\n\\t\\t\\tallegiance, asked for Allah's Forgiveness for them, and left the\\n\\t\\t\\tsecrets of their hearts for Allah to judge. Then I came to him,\\n\\t\\t\\tand when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and\\n\\t\\t\\tthen said, 'Come on.' So I came walking till I sat before him. He\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid to me, 'What stopped you from joining us. Had you not\\n\\t\\t\\tpurchased an animal For carrying you?' I answered, \"Yes, O\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle! But by Allah, if I were sitting before any\\n\\t\\t\\tperson from among the people of the world other than you, I would\\n\\t\\t\\thave avoided his anger with an excuse. \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tBy Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking\\n\\t\\t\\tfluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I knew well that if today\\n\\t\\t\\tI tell you a lie to seek your favor, Allah would surely make you\\n\\t\\t\\tangry with me in the near future, but if I tell you the truth,\\n\\t\\t\\tthough you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tForgiveness. Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah, I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I\\n\\t\\t\\tremained behind you.' Then Allah's Apostle said, 'As regards this\\n\\t\\t\\tman, he has surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides\\n\\t\\t\\tyour case.' I got up, and many men of Banu Salama followed me and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid to me. 'By Allah, we never witnessed you doing any sin\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore this. Surely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle as the others who did not join him, have offered. The\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer of Allah's Apostle to Allah to forgive you would have been\\n\\t\\t\\tsufficient for you.' By Allah, they continued blaming me so much\\n\\t\\t\\tthat I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of\\n\\t\\t\\thaving told a lie, but I said to them, 'Is there anybody else who\\n\\t\\t\\thas met the same fate as I have?' They replied, 'Yes, there are\\n\\t\\t\\ttwo men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of\\n\\t\\t\\tthem was given the same order as given to you.' I said, 'Who are\\n\\t\\t\\tthey?' They replied, Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al-Amri and Hilal bin\\n\\t\\t\\tUmaiya Al-Waqifi.' By that they mentioned to me two pious men who\\n\\t\\t\\thad attended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was\\n\\t\\t\\tan example for me. So I did not change my mind when they\\n\\t\\t\\tmentioned them to me. Allah's Apostle forbade all the Muslims to\\n\\t\\t\\ttalk to us, the three aforesaid persons out of all those who had\\n\\t\\t\\tremained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away from the people\\n\\t\\t\\tand they changed their attitude towards us till the very land\\n\\t\\t\\t(where I lived) appeared strange to me as if I did not know it.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWe remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards my two\\n\\t\\t\\tfellows, they remained in their houses and kept on weeping, but I\\n\\t\\t\\twas the youngest of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go\\n\\t\\t\\tout and witness the prayers along with the Muslims and roam about\\n\\t\\t\\tin the markets, but none would talk to me, and I would come to\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle and greet him while he was sitting in his\\n\\t\\t\\tgathering after the prayer, and I would wonder whether the\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet did move his lips in return to my greetings or not. Then\\n\\t\\t\\tI would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen I was busy with my prayer, he would turn his face towards\\n\\t\\t\\tme, but when I turned my face to him, he would turn his face away\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom me. When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I\\n\\t\\t\\twalked till I scaled the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada who was\\n\\t\\t\\tmy cousin and dearest person to me, and I offered my greetings to\\n\\t\\t\\thim. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said, 'O Abu\\n\\t\\t\\tQatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you know that I love Allah and\\n\\t\\t\\tHis Apostle?' He kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah, but he remained silent. Then I asked him again in the Name\\n\\t\\t\\tof Allah. He said, \"Allah and His Apostle know it better.'\\n\\t\\t\\tThereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped\\n\\t\\t\\tover the wall.\" Ka'b added, \"While I was walking in the market of\\n\\t\\t\\tMedina, suddenly I saw a Nabati (i.e. a Christian farmer) from\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in Medina,\\n\\t\\t\\tsaying, 'Who will lead me to Kab bin Malik?' The people began to\\n\\t\\t\\tpoint (me) out for him till he came to me and handed me a letter\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom the king of Ghassan in which the following was written:\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\"To proceed, I have been informed that your friend (i.e. the\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet ) has treated you harshly. Anyhow, Allah does not let you\\n\\t\\t\\tlive at a place where you feel inferior and your right is lost.\\n\\t\\t\\tSo join us, and we will console you.\"\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen I read it, I said to myself, 'This is also a sort of a\\n\\t\\t\\ttest.' Then I took the letter to the oven and made a fire therein\\n\\t\\t\\tby burning it. When forty out of the fifty nights elapsed,\\n\\t\\t\\tbehold! There came to me the messenger of Allah's Apostle and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'Allah's Apostle orders you to keep away from your wife,' I\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?' He said,\\n\\t\\t\\t'No, only keep aloof from her and do not cohabit her.' The\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said to\\n\\t\\t\\tmy wife. 'Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah\\n\\t\\t\\tgives His Verdict in this matter.\" Kab added, \"The wife of Hilal\\n\\t\\t\\tbin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Hilal\\n\\t\\t\\tbin Umaiya is a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on\\n\\t\\t\\thim. Do you dislike that I should serve him? ' He said, 'No (you\\n\\t\\t\\tcan serve him) but he should not come near you.' She said, 'By\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah, he has no desire for anything. By, Allah, he has never\\n\\t\\t\\tceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.' \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tOn that, some of my family members said to me, 'Will you also ask\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle to permit your wife (to serve you) as he has\\n\\t\\t\\tpermitted the wife of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?' I said, 'By\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah, I will not ask the permission of Allah's Apostle regarding\\n\\t\\t\\ther, for I do not know What Allah's Apostle would say if I asked\\n\\t\\t\\thim to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.' Then I\\n\\t\\t\\tremained in that state for ten more nights after that till the\\n\\t\\t\\tperiod of fifty nights was completed starting from the time when\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle prohibited the people from talking to us. When I\\n\\t\\t\\thad offered the Fajr prayer on the 50th morning on the roof of\\n\\t\\t\\tone of our houses and while I was sitting in the condition which\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah described (in the Qur'an) i.e. my very soul seemed\\n\\t\\t\\tstraitened to me and even the earth seemed narrow to me for all\\n\\t\\t\\tits spaciousness, there I heard the voice of one who had ascended\\n\\t\\t\\tthe mountain of Sala' calling with his loudest voice, 'O Kab bin\\n\\t\\t\\tMalik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).' I fell down in\\n\\t\\t\\tprostration before Allah, realizing that relief has come. Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle had announced the acceptance of our repentance by Allah\\n\\t\\t\\twhen he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out to\\n\\t\\t\\tcongratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two\\n\\t\\t\\tfellows, and a horseman came to me in haste, and a man of Banu\\n\\t\\t\\tAslam came running and ascended the mountain and his voice was\\n\\t\\t\\tswifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had\\n\\t\\t\\theard, came to me conveying the good tidings, I took off my\\n\\t\\t\\tgarments and dressed him with them; and by Allah, I owned no\\n\\t\\t\\tother garments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two\\n\\t\\t\\tgarments and wore them and went to Allah's Apostle.\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tThe people started receiving me in batches, congratulating me on\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Acceptance of my repentance, saying, 'We congratulate you\\n\\t\\t\\ton Allah's Acceptance of your repentance.' \" Kab further said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\"When I entered the mosque. I saw Allah's Apostle sitting with\\n\\t\\t\\tthe people around him. Talha bin Ubaidullah swiftly came to me,\\n\\t\\t\\tshook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the\\n\\t\\t\\tMuhajirin (i.e. emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha),\\n\\t\\t\\tand I will never forget this for Talha.\" Kab added, \"When I\\n\\t\\t\\tgreeted Allah's Apostle he, his face being bright with joy, said\\n\\t\\t\\t'Be happy with the best day that you have got ever since your\\n\\t\\t\\tmother delivered you.' \" Kab added, \"I said to the Prophet 'Is\\n\\t\\t\\tthis forgiveness from you or from Allah?' He said, 'No, it is\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom Allah.' Whenever Allah's Apostle became happy, his face\\n\\t\\t\\twould shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew that\\n\\t\\t\\tcharacteristic of him. When I sat before him, I said, 'O Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle! Because of the acceptance of my repentance I will give\\n\\t\\t\\tup all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle.\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle said, 'Keep some of your wealth, as it will be\\n\\t\\t\\tbetter for you.' I said, 'So I will keep my share from Khaibar\\n\\t\\t\\twith me,' and added, 'O Allah's Apostle! Allah has saved me for\\n\\t\\t\\ttelling the truth; so it is a part of my repentance not to tell\\n\\t\\t\\tbut the truth as long as I am alive. By Allah, I do not know\\n\\t\\t\\tanyone of the Muslims whom Allah has helped fortelling the truth\\n\\t\\t\\tmore than me. Since I have mentioned that truth to Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Allah will also save me (from telling lies) the rest of my\\n\\t\\t\\tlife. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse:  \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t'Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin (i.e.\\n\\t\\t\\temigrants (up to His Saying) And be with those who are true (in\\n\\t\\t\\tword and deed).'  (9.117-119) \\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tBy Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His\\n\\t\\t\\tguiding me to Islam, a Greater Blessing than the fact that I did\\n\\t\\t\\tnot tell a lie to Allah's Apostle which would have caused me to\\n\\t\\t\\tperish as those who have told a lie perished, for Allah described\\n\\t\\t\\tthose who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed\\n\\t\\t\\tto anybody else. Allah said:  'They (i.e. the hypocrites) will\\n\\t\\t\\tswear by Allah to you when you return to them (up to His Saying)\\n\\t\\t\\tCertainly Allah is not pleased with the rebellious people--' \"\\n\\t\\t\\t(9.95-96) Kab added, \"We, the three persons, differed altogether\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom those whose excuses Allah's Apostle accepted when they swore\\n\\t\\t\\tto him. He took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to\\n\\t\\t\\tforgive them, but Allah's Apostle left our case pending till\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah gave His Judgment about it. As for that Allah said):--\\n\\t\\t\\t'And to the three (He did forgive also) who remained behind.'\\n\\t\\t\\t(9.118)\\n\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our failure to\\n\\t\\t\\ttake part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to the deferment of making\\n\\t\\t\\ta decision by the Prophet about our case in contrast to the case\\n\\t\\t\\tof those who had taken an oath before him and he excused them by\\n\\t\\t\\taccepting their excuses.\"\\n\\t\\t</p>"
