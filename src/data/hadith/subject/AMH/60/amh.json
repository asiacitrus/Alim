He said, \"Hunayy! Do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot harm the people. Fear the supplication of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twronged, for the supplication of the wronged is answered.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLet the one with a small herd of camels and the one with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta small herd of sheep enter, but be wary of the livestock\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Ibn Awf and the livestock of Ibn Affan. If their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlivestock are destroyed, they will return to palm-trees\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand agriculture. If the livestock of the one with a small\\n\\t\\t\\t\\therd of camels and the one with a small herd of sheep are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestroyed, he will bring his children to me crying, 'Amir\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-muminin! Amir al-Muminin!' Shall I neglect them? Water\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand pasturage are of less value to me than gold and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsilver. By Allah, they think that I have wronged them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is their land and their water. They fought for it in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe jahiliyya and became muslims on it in Islam. By He in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhose hand my self is! Were it not for the mounts which I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgive to be ridden in the way of Allah, I would not have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tturned a span of their land into hima.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"
