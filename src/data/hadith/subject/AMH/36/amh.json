If some one says, 'Freeing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslaves comes under property,' he has erred. It is not as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the said. Had it been as he said, a slave could take an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toath with one witness, if he could find one, that his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaster had freed him.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"However, when a slave lays claim to a piece of property,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the can take an oath with one witness and demand his right\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas the freeman demands his right.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"The sunna with us is that when a slave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrings somebody who witnesses that he has been set free,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this master is made to take an oath that he has not freed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, and the slave's claim is dropped.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"The sunna about divorce is also like that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith us. When a woman brings somebody who witnesses that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther husband has divorced her, the husband is made to take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan oath that he has not divorced her. If he takes the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toath, the divorce does not proceed . \"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"There is only one sunna of bringing a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twitness in cases of divorce and freeing a slave. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright to make an oath only belongs to the husband of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twoman, and the master of the slave. Freeing is a hadd\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter, and the testimony of women is not permitted in it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause when a slave is freed, his inviolability is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffirmed and the hadd punishments are applied for and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst him. If he commits fornication and he is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmuhsan, he is stoned. If he kills a slave, he is killed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor it. Inheritance is established for him, between him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand whoever inherits from him. If somebody disputes this,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\targuing that if a man frees his slave and then a man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomes to demand from the master of the slave payment of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdebt, and a man and two women testify to his right, that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablishes the right against the master of the slave so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat his freeing him is cancelled if he only has the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave as property, inferring by this case that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttestimony of women is permitted in cases of setting free.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe case is not as he suggests (i.e. it is a case of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty not freeing). It is like a man who frees his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave, and then the claimant of a debt comes to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaster and takes an oath with one witness, demanding his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright. By that, the freeing of the slave would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcancelled. Or else a man comes who has frequent dealings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand transactions with the master of the slave. He claims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he is owed money by the master of the slave. Someone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsays to the master of the slave, 'Take an oath that you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdon't owe what he claims'. If he draws back and refuses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto take an oath, the one making the claim takes an oath\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand his right against the master of the slave is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfirmed. That would cancel the freeing of the slave if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is confirmed that property is owed by the master.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"It is the same case with a man who marries a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave-girl and then the master of the slave-girl comes to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe man who has married her and claims, 'You and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso-and-so have bought my slave-girl from me for such an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamount of dinars. The husband of the slave-girl denies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat. The master of the slave-girl brings a man and two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen and they testify to what he has said. The sale is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfirmed and his claim is considered true. So the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave-girl is haram for her husband and they have to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseparate, even though the testimony of women is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccepted in divorce.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"It is also the same case with a man who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccuses a free man, so the hadd falls on him. A man and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo women come and testify that the one accused is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave. That would remove the hadd from the accused after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit had befallen him, even though the testimony of women\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis not accepted in accusations involving hadd\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunishments.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"Another similar case in which judgement\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappears to go against the precedent of the sunna is that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo women testify that a child is born alive and so it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary for him to inherit if a situation arises where\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the is entitled to inherit, and the child's property goes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto those who inherit from him, if he dies, and it is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary that the two women witnesses should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccompanied by a man or an oath even though it may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvolve vast properties of gold, silver, live-stock,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgardens and slaves and other properties. However, had two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen testified to one dirham or more or less than that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin a property case, their testimony would not affect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything and would not be permitted unless there was a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twitness or an oath with them.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"There are people who say that an oath is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacceptable with only one witness and they argue by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tword of Allah the Blessed, the Exalted, and His word is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Truth, 'And call in to witness two witnesses, men; or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif the two be not men, then one man and two women, such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twitnesses as you approve of.' (Sura 2 ayat 282). Such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople argue that if he does not bring one man and two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen, he has no claim and he is not allowed to take an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toath with one witness.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"Part of the proof against those who argue\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis, is to reply to them, 'Do you think that if a man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclaimed property from a man, the one claimed from would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot swear that the claim was false?' If he swears, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclaim against him is dropped. If he refuses to take an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toath, the claimant is made to take an oath that his claim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis true, and his right against his companion is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablished. There is no dispute about this with any of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe people nor in any country. By what does he take this?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn what place in the Book of Allah does he find it? So if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the confirms this, let him confirm the oath with one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twitness, even if it is not in the Book of Allah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMighty, the Majestic! It is enough that this is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprecedent of the sunna. However, man wants to recognise\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe proper course of action and the location of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproof. In this there is a clarification for what is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobscure about that, if Allah ta'ala wills.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

The palm is not like the animal.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFruit is not like the foetus in its mother's womb. Part\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof what clarifies that is also that it is the usage of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople to have a man pawn the fruit of the palm apart\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the palm. No one pawns the foetus in its mother's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomb whether of slaves or animals.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

The one testified for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis only given his due from the share of the testifier.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik said, \"An example of this is that a man dies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleaving two sons, and 600 dinars. Each of them takes 300\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdinars. Then one of them testifies that his deceased\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfather confirmed that so-and-so was his son. The one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttestifies is obliged to give 100 dinars to the one thus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconnected. This is half of the inheritance of the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthought to be related, had he been related. If the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfirms him, he takes the other 100 and so he completes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this right and his relationship is established. His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tposition is similar to that of a woman who confirms a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdebt against her father or her husband and the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theirs deny it. She must pay to the person whose debt she\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfirms, the amount according to her share of the full\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdebt, had it been confirmed against all the heirs. If the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twoman inherits an eighth, she pays the creditor an eighth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his debt. If a daughter inherits a half, she pays the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreditor half of his debt.

If he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes not take an oath, he only takes from the inheritance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the one who confirmed him according to his share of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe debt, because he confirmed his right and the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theirs denied it.
