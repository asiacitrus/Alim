There was no water nearby and the\\n    people were not carrying any with them, so they came to\\n    Abu Bakr as-Siddiq and said, 'Don't you see what A'isha\\n    has done? She has made the Messenger of Allah, may Allah\\n    bless him and grant him peace, and the people stop when\\n    there is no water nearby and they are not carrying any\\n    with them.' \"\\n   </p><p>\\n    A'isha continued, \"Abu Bakr came and the Messenger of\\n    Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had\\n    fallen asleep with his head on my thigh . Abu Bakr said,\\n    'You have made the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless\\n    him and grant him peace, and the people stop when there\\n    is no water nearby and they are not carrying any with\\n    them ' \"\\n   </p><p>\\n    She continued, \"Abu Bakr remonstrated with me and said\\n    whatever Allah willed him to say, and began to poke me in\\n    the waist. The only thing that stopped me from moving was\\n    that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and\\n    grant him peace, had his head on my thigh. The Messenger\\n    of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, slept\\n    until morning found him with no water. Allah, the Blessed\\n    and Exalted, sent down the ayat of tayammum and so they\\n    did tayammum.

He\\n    said, \"No, he does tayammum for every prayer, because he\\n    has to look for water for every prayer. If he looks for\\n    it and does not find it then he does tayammum.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik was asked whether a man who did tayammum could lead\\n    others in prayer if they were in wudu. He said, \"I prefer\\n    that someone else should lead them. However, I see no\\n    harm in it if he does lead them in prayer.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Yahya said that Malik said that a man who did tayammum\\n    because he could not find any water, and then stood and\\n    said the takbir and entered into the prayer, and then\\n    someone came with some water, did not stop his prayer but\\n    completed it with tayammum and did wudu for future\\n    prayers.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Yahya said that Malik said, \"Whoever rises for prayer and\\n    does not find water and so does what Allah has ordered\\n    him to do of tayammum has obeyed Allah. Someone who does\\n    find water is neither purer than him nor more perfect in\\n    prayer, because both have been commanded and each does as\\n    Allah has commanded. What Allah has commanded as far as\\n    wudu is concerned is for the one who finds water, and\\n    tayammum is for the one who does not find water before he\\n    enters into the prayer.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said that a man who was in a state of major ritual\\n    impurity could do tayammum and read his portion of Qur'an\\n    and do voluntary prayers as long as he did not find any\\n    water. This applied only to circumstances in which it was\\n    allowable to pray with tayammum.\\n   </p>"

This\\n    applied only when the share of each man among them\\n    reached the zakatable amount, because the Messenger of\\n    Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had said,\\n    \"There is no zakat to pay on less than five awaq of\\n    silver.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik commented, \"This is what I prefer most out of what\\n    I have heard about the matter.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"When a man has gold and silver dispersed\\n    among various people he must add it all up together and\\n    then take out the zakat due on the total sum .\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"No zakat is due from some one who acquires\\n    gold or silver until a year has elapsed over his\\n    acquisition from the day it became his.\"\\n   </p>"

If there is an equal\\n    number of sheep and goats, he takes the ewe from\\n    whichever kind he wishes.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Yahya said that Malik said, \"Similarly, Arabian camels\\n    and Bactrian camels are added up together in order to\\n    assess the zakat that the owner has to pay. They are all\\n    considered as camels. If there are more Arabian camels\\n    than Bactrians and the owner only has to pay one camel,\\n    the zakat collector takes it from the Arabian ones. If,\\n    however, there are more Bactrian camels he takes it from\\n    those. If there is an equal number of both, he takes the\\n    camel from whichever kind he wishes.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"Similarly, cows and water buffaloes are\\n    added up together and are all considered as cattle. If\\n    there are more cows than water buffalo and the owner only\\n    has to pay one cow, the zakat collector takes it from the\\n    cows. If there are more water buffalo, he takes it from\\n    them. If there is an equal number of both, he takes the\\n    cow from whichever kind he wishes.  So if zakat is\\n    necessary, it is assessed taking both kinds as one\\n    group.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Yahya said that Malik said, \"No zakat is due from anyone\\n    who comes into possession of livestock, whether camels or\\n    cattle or sheep and goats, until a year has elapsed over\\n    them from the day he acquired them, unless he already had\\n    in his possession a nisab of livestock.

If he already had five head of camels, or thirty\\n    cattle, or forty sheep and goats, and he then acquired\\n    additional camels, or cattle, or sheep and goats, either\\n    by trade, or gift, or inheritance, he must pay zakat on\\n    them when he pays the zakat on the livestock he already\\n    has, even if a year has not elapsed over the acquisition.\\n    And even if the additional livestock that he acquired has\\n    had zakat taken from it the day before he bought it, or\\n    the day before he inherited it, he must still pay the\\n    zakat on it when he pays the zakat on the livestock he\\n    already has \"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Yahya said that Malik said, \"This is the same situation\\n    as some one who has some silver on which he pays the\\n    zakat and then uses to buy some goods with from somebody\\n    else.

Neither do you take an akula, or a rubba, or a\\n    makhid, or male sheep and goats in their second and third\\n    years, and this is a just compromise between the young of\\n    sheep and goats and the best of them.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"A sakhla is a newborn lamb or kid. A rubba\\n    is a mother that is looking after her offspring, a makhid\\n    is a pregnant ewe or goat, and an akula is a sheep or\\n    goat that is being fattened for meat.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, about a man who had sheep and goats on which\\n    he did not have to pay any zakat, but which increased by\\n    birth to a zakatable amount on the day before the zakat\\n    collector came to them, \"If the number of sheep and goats\\n    along with their (newborn) offspring reaches a zakatable\\n    amount then the man has to pay zakat on them.

Whereas a man who has a\\n    zakatable amount of sheep and goats, or cattle, or\\n    camels, and then acquires another camel, cow, sheep or\\n    goat, pays zakat on it at the same time that he pays the\\n    zakat on the others of its kind, if he already has a\\n    zakatable amount of livestock of that particular kind.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"This is the best of what I have heard about\\n    this. \"\\n   </p>"

Zakat must be paid on anything above five awsuq\\n    according to the amount involved.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The kinds of grain and seeds on which there\\n    is zakat are:  wheat, barley, sult (a kind of barley),\\n    sorghum, pearl millet, rice, lentils, peas, beans, sesame\\n    seeds and other such grains and seeds which are used for\\n    food.  Zakat is taken from them after they have been\\n    harvested and are in the form of grai n or seed.\" He\\n    said, \"People are entrusted with the assessment and\\n    whatever they hand over is accepted .\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik was asked whether the tenth or the twentieth was\\n    taken out of olives before they were sold or after and he\\n    said, \"The sale is not taken into consideration. It is\\n    the people who produce the olives that are asked about\\n    the olives, just as it is the people who produce\\n    foodstuffs that are asked about it, and zakat is taken\\n    from them by what they say. Someone who gets five awsuq\\n    or more of olives from his olive trees has a tenth taken\\n    from the oil after pressing. Whereas someone who does not\\n    get five awsuq from his trees does not have to pay any\\n    zakat on the oil.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"Someone who sells his crops when they are\\n    ripe and are ready in the husk has to pay zakat on them\\n    but the one who buys them does not. The sale of crops is\\n    not valid until they are ready in the husk and no longer\\n    need water.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, concerning the word of Allah the Exalted,\\n    \"And give its due on the day of its harvesting,\" that it\\n    referred to zakat, and that he had heard people saying\\n    that.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"If someone sells his garden or his land, on\\n    which are crops or fruit which have not yet ripened, then\\n    it is the buyer who has to pay the zakat. If, however,\\n    they have ripened, it is the seller who has to pay the\\n    zakat, unless paying the zakat is one of the conditions\\n    of the sale.\"\\n   </p>"

                "text": "<p>\\n    Malik said, \"If a man has four awsuq of dates he has\\n    harvested, four awsuq of grapes he has picked, or four\\n    awsuq of wheat he has reaped or four awsuq of pulses he\\n    has harvested, the different categories are not added\\n    together, and he does not have to pay zakat on any of the\\n    categ ries - the dates, the grapes, the wheat or the\\n    pulses - until any one of them comes to five awsuq using\\n    the sa of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him\\n    peace, as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and\\n    grant him peace, said, 'There is no zakat (to pay) on\\n    anything less than five awsuq of dates. 'lf any of the\\n    categories comes to five awsuq, then zakat must be paid.\\n    If none of the categories comes to five awsuq, then there\\n    is no zakat to pay. The explanation of this is that when\\n    a man harvests five awsuq of dates (from his palms), he\\n    adds them all together and deducts the zakat from them\\n    even if they are all of different kinds and varieties. It\\n    is the same with different kinds of cereal, such as brown\\n    wheat, white wheat, barley and sult, which are all\\n    considered as one category. If a man reaps five awsuq of\\n    any of these, he adds it all together and pays zakat on\\n    it. If it does not come to that amount he does not have\\n    to pay any zakat. It is the same (also) with grapes,\\n    whether they be black or red. If a man picks five awsuq\\n    of them he has to pay zakat on them, but if they do not\\n    come to that amount he does not have to pay any zakat.\\n    Pulses also are considered as one category, like cereals,\\n    dates and grapes, even if they are of different varieties\\n    and are called by different names. Pulses include\\n    chick-peas, lentils, beans, peas, and anything which is\\n    agreed by everybody to be a pulse. If a man harvests five\\n    awsuq of pulses, measuring by the aforementioned sa, the\\n    sa of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him\\n    peace, he collects them all together and must pay zakat\\n    on them, even if they are of every kind of pulse and not\\n    just one kind.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, ''Umar ibn al-Khattab drew a distinction\\n    between pulses and wheat when he took zakat from the\\n    Nabatean christians. He considered all pulses to be one\\n    category and took a tenth from them, and from cereals and\\n    raisins he took a twentieth.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"If some one asks, 'How can pulses be added\\n    up all together when assessing the zakat so that there is\\n    just one payment, when a man can barter two of one kind\\n    for one of another, while cereals can not be bartered at\\n    a rate of two to one?', then tell him, 'Gold and silver\\n    are collected together when assessing the zakat, even\\n    though an amount of gold dinars can be exchanged for many\\n    times tha tamount of silver dirhams.' \"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, regarding date palms which are shared equally\\n    between two men, and from which eight awsuq of dates are\\n    harvested, \"They do not have to pay any zakat on them. If\\n    one man owns five awsuq of what is harvested from one\\n    piece of land, and the other owns four awsuq or less, the\\n    one who owns the five awsuq has to pay zakat, and the\\n    other one, who harvested four awsuq or less, does not\\n    have to pay zakat. This is how things are done whenever\\n    there are associates in any crop, whether the crop is\\n    grain or seeds that are reaped, or dates that are\\n    harvested, or grapes that are picked . Any one of them\\n    that harvests five awsuq of dates, or picks five awsuq of\\n    grapes, or reaps five awsuq of wheat, has to pay zakat,\\n    and whoever's portion is less than five awsuq does not\\n    have to pay zakat. Zakat only has to be paid by someone\\n    whose harvesting or picking or reaping comes to five\\n    awsuq.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The sunna with us regarding anything from\\n    any of these categories, i.e. wheat, dates, grapes and\\n    any kind of grain o rseed, which has had the zakat\\n    deducted from it and is then stored by its owner for a\\n    number of years after he has paid the zakat on it until\\n    he sell sit, is that he does not have to pay any zakat on\\n    the price he sells it for until a year has elapsed over\\n    it from the day he made the sale, as long as he got it\\n    through (chance) acquisition or some other means and it\\n    was not intended for trading. Cereals, seeds and\\n    trade-goods are the same, in that if a man acquires some\\n    and keeps them for a number of years and then sells them\\n    for gold or silver, he does not have to pay zakat on\\n    their price until a year has elapsed over it from the day\\n    of sale. If, however, the goods were intended for trade\\n    then the owner must pay zakat on them when he sells them,\\n    as long as he has had them for a year from the day when\\n    he paid zakat on the property with which he bought them.\"\\n   </p>"

Then the Messenger of Allah,\\n    may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came in. A'isha\\n    said, \"Hafsa asked, anticipating me in speech - she took\\n    after her father Umar - 'Messenger of Allah, A'isha and I\\n    began the morning fasting voluntarily and then food was\\n    given us and we broke the fast with it.'  The Messenger\\n    of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,\\n    'Fast another day in its place.' \"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Yahya said that he heard Malik say, \"Someone who eats or\\n    drinks out of neglect or forgetfulness during a voluntary\\n    fast does not have to repeat his fast, but he should\\n    continue fasting for the rest of the day in which he eats\\n    or drinks while voluntarily fasting, and not stop\\n    fasting. Someone to whom something unexpected happens\\n    which causes him to break his fast while he is fasting\\n    voluntarily does not have to repeat his fast if he has\\n    broken it for a reason, and not simply because he decided\\n    to break his fast. Just as I do not think that someone\\n    has to repeat a voluntary prayer if he has had to stop it\\n    because of some discharge which he could prevent and\\n    which meant that he had to repeat his wudu.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"Once a man has begun doing any of the right\\n    actions (al-amal as-saliha) such as the prayer, the fast\\n    and the hajj, or similar right actions of a voluntary\\n    nature, he should not stop until he has completed it\\n    according to what the sunna for that action is. If he\\n    says the takbir he should not stop until he has prayed\\n    two rakas. If he is fasting he should not break his fast\\n    until he has completed that day's fast. If he goes into\\n    ihram he should not return until he has completed his\\n    hajj, and if he begins doing tawaf he should not stop\\n    doing so until he has gone around the Kaba seven times.\\n    He should not stop doing any of these actions once he has\\n    started them until he has completed them, except if\\n    something happens such as illness or some other matter by\\n    which a man is excused. This is because Allah, the\\n    Blessed and Exalted, says in His Book, 'And eat and drink\\n    until the white thread becomes clear to you from the\\n    black thread of dawn, (and) then complete the fast until\\n    night-time,' (Sura 2 ayat 187), and so he must complete\\n    his fast as Allah has said. Allah, the Exalted, (also)\\n    says, 'And complete the hajj and the umra forAllah,' and\\n    so if a man were to go into ihram for a voluntary hajj\\n    having done his one obligatory hajj (on a previous\\n    occasion), he could not then stop doing his hajj having\\n    once begun it and leave ihram while in the middle of his\\n    hajj. Anyone that begins a voluntary act must complete it\\n    once he has begun doing it, just as an obligatory act\\n    must be completed . This is the best of what I have\\n    heard.\"\\n   </p>"

In the same way, someone outside the Haram\\n    who throws anything into the Haram and hits game he did\\n    not intend to, killing it, has to pay compensation,\\n    because the intentional and the mistaken are in the same\\n    position in this matter.' \"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, concerning people who kill game together\\n    while they are muhrim or in the Haram, \"I think that each\\n    one of them owes a full share. If a sacrificial animal is\\n    decided for them, each one of them owes one, and if\\n    fasting is decided for them, the full fasting is owed by\\n    each one of them. The analogy of that is a group of\\n    people who kill a man by mistake and the kaffara for that\\n    is that each person among them must free a slave or fast\\n    two consecutive months.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"Anyone who stones or hunts game after\\n    stoning the jamra and shaving his head but before he has\\n    performed the tawaf al-ifada, owes compensation for that\\n    game, because Allah the Blessed, the Exalted said, 'And\\n    when you leave ihram, then hunt,' and restrictions still\\n    remain for someone who has not done the tawaf al-ifada\\n    about touching perfume and women.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The person in ihram does not owe anything\\n    for plants he cuts down in the Haram and it has not\\n    reached us that anyone has given a decision of anything\\n    for it, but O how wrong is what he has done! \"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, concerning some one who was ignorant of, or\\n    who forgot the fast of three days in the hajj, or who was\\n    ill during them and so did not fast them until he had\\n    returned to his community, \"He must offer a sacrificial\\n    animal (hady) if he can find one and if not he must fast\\n    the three days among his people and the remaining seven\\n    after that.\"\\n   </p>"

Malik said, \"The generally\\n    agreed on way of doing things among us and what I have\\n    seen the people of knowledge in our city doing is that\\n    the paternal grandfather does not inherit anything at all\\n    with the father. He is given a sixth as a fixed share\\n    with the son and the grandson through a son. Other than\\n    that, when the deceased does not leave a mother or a\\n    paternal aunt, one begins with whoever has a fixed share,\\n    and they are given their shares. If there is a sixth of\\n    the property left over, the grandfather is given a sixth\\n    as a fixed share.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"When someone shares with the grandfather and\\n    the full siblings in a specified share, one begins with\\n    whoever shares with them of the people of fixed shares.\\n    They are given their shares. What is left over after that\\n    belongs to the grandfather and the full siblings. Then\\n    one sees which is the more favourable of two alternatives\\n    for the portion of the grandfather. Either a third is\\n    allotted to him and the siblings to divide between them,\\n    and he gets a share as if he were one of the siblings, or\\n    else he takes a sixth from all the capital. Whichever is\\n    the best portion for the grandfather is given to him.\\n    What is left after that, goes to the full siblings. The\\n    male gets the portion of two females except in one\\n    particular case. The division in this case is different\\n    from the preceding one. This case is when a woman dies\\n    and leaves a husband, mother, full sister and\\n    grandfather. The husband gets a half, the mother gets a\\n    third, the grandfather gets a sixth, and the full sister\\n    gets a half. The sixth of the grandfather and the half of\\n    the sister are joined and divided into thirds. The male\\n    gets the share of two females. Therefore, the grandfather\\n    has two thirds, and the sister has one third.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The inheritance of the half-siblings by the\\n    father with the grandfather when there are no full\\n    siblings with them, is like the inheritance of the full\\n    siblings (in the same situation). The males are the same\\n    as their males and the females are the same as their\\n    females. When there are both full siblings and\\n    half-siblings by the father, the full siblings include in\\n    their number the number of half-siblings by the father,\\n    to limit the inheritance of the grandfather, i.e., if\\n    there was only one full sibling with the grandfather.\\n    They would share, after the allotting of the fixed\\n    shares, the remainder of the inheritance between them\\n    equally. If there were also two half-siblings by the\\n    father, their number is added to the division of the sum,\\n    which would then be divided four ways. A quarter going to\\n    the grandfather and three-quarters going to the full\\n    siblings who annex the shares technically allotted to the\\n    half-siblings by the father. They do not include the\\n    number of half-siblings by the mother, because if there\\n    were only half-siblings by the father they would not\\n    inherit anything with the grandfather and all the capital\\n    would belong to the grandfather, and so the siblings\\n    would not get anything after the portion of the\\n    grandfather.\\n   </p><p>\\n    \"It belongs to the full siblings more than the\\n    half-siblings by the father, and the half-siblings by the\\n    father do not get anything with them unless the full\\n    siblings consist of one sister. If there is one full\\n    sister, she includes the grandfather with the\\n    half-siblings by her father in the division, however\\n    many. Whatever remains for her and these half-siblings by\\n    the father goes to her rather than them until she has had\\n    her complete share, which is half of the total capital.\\n    If there is surplus beyond half of all the capital in\\n    what she and the half-siblings by the father acquire it\\n    goes to them.

Then she was brought an\\n    animal - a donkey, a sheep, or a bird, and she would\\n    break her idda with it, by rubbing her body against it\\n    (taftaddu). Rarely did she break her idda with anything\\n    (by rubbing herself against it) but that it died. Then\\n    she would come out and would be given a piece of dung.\\n    She would throw it away and then return to whatever she\\n    wished of perfumes or whatever.' \"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik explained, 'Taftaddu' means to wipe her skin with\\n    it in the same way as with a healing charm.\"\\n   </p>"

If\\n    there is no appreciable difference between the slaves,\\n    two should not be bartered for one with a stated delay in\\n    the terms even if their racial type is different.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"There is nothing wrong in selling what has\\n    been bought in such a transaction before taking\\n    possession of all of it as long as you receive the price\\n    for it from some one other than the original owner.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"An addition to the price must not be made\\n    for a foetus in the womb of its mother when she is sold\\n    because that is gharar (an uncertain transaction). It is\\n    not known whether the child will be male or female,\\n    good-looking or ugly, normal or handicapped, alive or\\n    dead. All these things will affect the price.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said that in a transaction where a slave or\\n    slave-girl was bought for one hundred dinars with a\\n    stated credit period that if the seller regretted the\\n    sale there was nothing wrong in him asking the buyer to\\n    revoke it for ten dinars which he would pay him\\n    immediately or after a period and he would forgo his\\n    right to the hundred dinars which he was owed.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"However, if the buyer regrets and asks the\\n    seller to revoke the sale of a slave or slave-girl in\\n    consideration of which he will pay an extra ten dinars\\n    immediately or on credit terms, extended beyond the\\n    original term, that should not be done. It is disapproved\\n    of because it is as if, for instance, the seller is\\n    buying the one hundred dinars which is not yet due on a\\n    year's credit term before the year expires for a\\n    slave-girl and ten dinars to be paid immediately or on\\n    credit term longer than the year. This falls into the\\n    category of selling gold for gold when delayed terms\\n    enter into it.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said that it was not proper for a man to sell a\\n    slave-girl to another man for one hundred dinars on\\n    credit and then to buy her back for more than the\\n    original price or on a credit term longer than the\\n    original term for which he sold her. To understand why\\n    that was disapproved of in that case, the example of a\\n    man who sold a slave-girl on credit and then bought her\\n    back on a credit term longer than the original term was\\n    looked at. He might have sold her for thirty dinars with\\n    a month to pay and then buy her back for sixty dinars\\n    with a year or half a year to pay. The outcome would only\\n    be that his goods would have returned to him just like\\n    they were and the other party would have given him thirty\\n    dinars on a month's credit against sixty dinars on a year\\n    or half a year's credit. That was not to be done.\\n   </p>"

The person who\\n    bought the slave complained to Abdullah ibn Umar that the\\n    slave had a disease which he had not told him about. They\\n    argued and went to Uthman ibn Affan for a decision . The\\n    man said, \"He sold me a slave with a disease which he did\\n    not tell me about.\" Abdullah said, \"I sold to him with\\n    the stipulation that I was not responsible.\" Uthman ibn\\n    Affan decided that Abdullah ibn Umar should take an oath\\n    that he had sold the slave without knowing that he had\\n    any disease. Abdullah ibn Umar refused to take the oath,\\n    so the slave was returned to him and recovered his health\\n    in his possession. Abdullah sold him afterwards for 1500\\n    dirhams.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The generally agreed upon way of doing\\n    things among us about a man who buys a female slave and\\n    she becomes pregnant, or who buys a slave and then frees\\n    him, or if there is any other such matter which has\\n    already happened so that he cannot return his purchase,\\n    and a clear proof is established that there was a fault\\n    in that purchase when it was in the hands of the seller\\n    or the fault is admitted by the seller or someone else,\\n    is that the slave or slave-girl is assessed for its value\\n    with the fault it is found to have had on the day of\\n    purchase and the buyer is refunded,from what he paid,the\\n    difference between the price of a slave who is sound and\\n    a slave with such a defect.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The generally agreed upon way of doing\\n    things among us regarding a man who buys a slave and then\\n    finds out that the slave has a defect for which he can be\\n    returned and meanwhile another defect has happened to the\\n    slave whilst in his possession, is that if the defect\\n    which occurred to the slave in his possession has harmed\\n    him, like loss of a limb, loss of an eye, or something\\n    similar, then he has a choice. If he wants, he can have\\n    the price of the slave reduced commensurate with the\\n    defect (he bought him with ) according to the prices on\\n    the day he bought him, or if he likes, he can pay\\n    compensation for the defect which the slave has suffered\\n    in his possession and return him. The choice is up to\\n    him. If the slave dies in his possession, the slave is\\n    valued with the defect which he had on the day of his\\n    purchase. It is seen what his price would really have\\n    been. If the price of the slave on the day of purchase\\n    without fault was 100 dinars, and his price on the day of\\n    purchase with fault would have been 80 dinars, the price\\n    is reduced by the difference. These prices are assessed\\n    according to the market value on the day the slave was\\n    purchased . \"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The generally agreed upon way of doing\\n    things among us is that if a man returns a slave girl in\\n    whom he has found a defect and he has already had\\n    intercourse with her, he must pay what he has reduced of\\n    her price if she was a virgin. If she was not a virgin,\\n    there is nothing against his having had intercourse with\\n    her because he had charge of her.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The generally agreed upon way of doing\\n    things among us regarding a person, whether he is an\\n    inheritor or not, who sells a slave, slave-girl, or\\n    animal without a liability agreement is that he is not\\n    responsible for any defect in what he sold unless he knew\\n    about the fault and concealed it.

He said, \"The slave-girl worth two\\n    other slave-girls is valued for her price. Then the other\\n    two slave-girls are valued, ignoring the defect which the\\n    one of them has. Then the price of the slave-girl sold\\n    for two slave-girls is divided between them according to\\n    their prices so that the proportion of each of them in\\n    her price is arrived at - to the higher priced one\\n    according to her higher price, and to the other according\\n    to her value. Then one looks at the one with the defect,\\n    and the buyer is refunded according to the amount her\\n    share is affected by the defect, be it little or great.\\n    The price of the two slave-girls is based on their market\\n    value on the day that they were bought.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik spoke about a man who bought a slave and hired him\\n    out on a long-term or short-term basis and then found out\\n    that the slave had a defect which necessitated his\\n    return. He said that if the man returned the slave\\n    because of the defect, he kept the hire and revenue.\\n    \"This is the way in which things are done in our city.\\n    That is because, had the man bought a slave who then\\n    built a house for him, and the value of the house was\\n    many times the price of the slave, and he then found that\\n    the slave had a defect for which he could be returned,\\n    and he was returned, he would not have to make payment\\n    for the work the slave had done for him. Similarly, he\\n    would keep any revenue from hiring him out, because he\\n    had charge of him. This is the way of doing things among\\n    us.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The way of doing things among us when\\n    someone buys several slaves in one lot and then finds\\n    that one of them has been stolen, or has a defect, is\\n    that he looks at the one he finds has been stolen or the\\n    one in which he finds a defect. If he is the pick of\\n    those slaves, or the most expensive, or it was for his\\n    sake that he bought them, or he is the one in whom people\\n    see the most excellence, then the whole sale is returned.\\n    If the one who is found to be stolen or to have a defect\\n    is not the pick of the slaves, and he did not buy them\\n    for his sake, and there is no special virtue which people\\n    see in him, the one who is found to have a defect or to\\n    have been stolen is returned as he is, and the buyer is\\n    refunded his portion of the total price.\"\\n   </p>"

The explanation of\\n    muzabana is that it is buying something whose number,\\n    weight and measure is not known with something whose\\n    number, weight or measure is known, for instance, if a\\n    man has a stack of food whose measure is not known,\\n    either of wheat, dates, or whatever food, or the man has\\n    goods of wheat, date kernels, herbs, safflower, cotton,\\n    flax, silk, and does not know its measure or weight or\\n    number and then a buyer approaches him and proposes that\\n    he weigh or measure or count the goods, but, before he\\n    does, he specifies a certain weight, or measure, or\\n    number and guarantees to pay the price for that amount,\\n    agreeing that whatever falls short of that amount is a\\n    loss against him and whatever is in excess of that amount\\n    is a gain for him. That is not a sale. It is taking risks\\n    and it is an uncertain transaction. It falls into the\\n    category of gambling because he is not buying something\\n    from him for something definite which he pays. Everything\\n    which resembles this is also forbidden.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said that another example of that was, for\\n    instance, a man proposing to another man, \"You have\\n    cloth. I will guarantee you from this cloth of yours so\\n    many hooded cloaks, the measureof each cloak to be\\n    such-and-such, (naming a measurement). Whatever loss\\n    there is, is against me and I will fulfill you the\\n    specified amount and whatever excess there is, is mine.\"\\n    Or perhaps the man proposed, \"I will guarantee you from\\n    this cloth of yours so many shirts, the measurement of\\n    each shirt to be such-and-such, and whatever loss there\\n    is, is against me and I will fulfill the specified amount\\n    and whatever excess there is, is mine.\" Or perhaps a man\\n    proposed to a man who had cattle or camel hides, \"I will\\n    cut up these hides of yours into sandals on a pattern I\\n    will show you. Whatever falls short of a hundred pairs, I\\n    will make up its loss and whatever is over is mine\\n    because I guaranteed you.\" Another example was that a man\\n    say to a man who had ben-nuts, \"I will press these nuts\\n    of yours. Whatever falls short of such-and-such a weight\\n    by the pound, I will make it up, and whatever is more\\n    than that is mine.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said that all this and whatever else was like it or\\n    resembled it was in the category of muzabana, which was\\n    neither good nor permitted. It was also the same case for\\n    a man to say to a man, who had fodder leaves, date\\n    kernels, cotton, flax, herbs or safflower, \"I will buy\\n    these leaves from you in exchange for such-and-such a sa,\\n    (indicating leaves which are pounded like his leaves) . .\\n    or these date kernels for such-and-such a sa of kernels\\n    like them, and the like of that in the case of safflower,\\n    cotton, flax and herbs.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"All this is what we have described of\\n    muzabana.\"\\n   </p>"

                "text": "<p>\\n    Malik said, \"There is no harm in buying dates from\\n    specified trees or a specified orchard or buying milk\\n    from specified sheep when the buyer starts to take them\\n    as soon as he has payed the price. That is like buying\\n    oil from a container. A man buys some of it for a dinar\\n    or two and gives his gold and stipulates that it be\\n    measured out for him. There is no harm in that. If the\\n    container breaks and the oil is wasted, the buyer has his\\n    gold back and there is no transaction between them.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"There is no harm in everything which is\\n    taken right away as it is, like fresh milk and fresh\\n    picked dates which the buyer can take on a day-to-day\\n    basis. If the supply runs out before the buyer has what\\n    he has paid for in full, the seller gives him back the\\n    portion of the gold that is owed to him, or else the\\n    buyer takes other goods from him to the value of what he\\n    is owed and which they mutually agree about. The buyer\\n    should stay with the seller until he has taken it. It is\\n    disapproved of for the seller to leave because the\\n    transaction would then come into the forbidden category\\n    of a debt for a debt. If a stated time period for payment\\n    or delivery enters into the transaction, it is also\\n    disapproved. Delay and deferment are not permitted in it,\\n    and are only acceptable when it is standard practice on\\n    definite terms by which the seller guarantees it to the\\n    buyer, but this is not to be from one specific orchard or\\n    from any specific ewes.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik was asked about a man who bought an orchard from\\n    another man in which there were various types of\\n    palm-trees - excellent ajwa palms, good kabis palms, adhq\\n    palms and othertypes. The seller kept aside from the sale\\n    the produce of a certain palm of his choice. Malik said,\\n    \"That is not good because if he does that, and keeps\\n    aside, for instance, dates of the ajwa variety whose\\n    yield would be 15 sa, and he picks the dates of the kabis\\n    in their place, and the yield of their dates is 10 sa or\\n    he picks the ajwa which yield 15 sa and leaves the kabis\\n    which yield 10 sa, it is as if he bought the ajwa for the\\n    kabis making allowances for their difference of quality.\\n    This is the same as if a man dealing with a man who has\\n    heaps of dates before him - a heap of 15 sa of ajwa, a\\n    heap of 10 sa of kabis, and a heap of 12 sa of cadhq,\\n    gives the owner of the dates a dinar to let him choose\\n    and take whichever of the heaps he likes.\" Malik said,\\n    \"That is not good.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik was asked what a man who bought fresh dates from\\n    the owner of an orchard and advanced him a dinar was\\n    entitled to if the crop was spoilt. Malik said, \"The\\n    buyer makes a reckoning with the owner of the orchard and\\n    takes what is due to him of the dinar. If the buyer has\\n    taken two-thirds of a dinar's worth of dates, he gets\\n    back the third of a dinar which is owed him. If the buyer\\n    has taken three-quarters of a dinar's worth of dates,\\n    then he gets back the quarter which is owed to him, or\\n    they come to a mutual agreement, and the buyer takes what\\n    is owed him from his dinar from the owner of the orchard\\n    in something else of his choosing. If, for instance, he\\n    prefers to take dry dates or some other goods, he takes\\n    them according to what is due. If he takes dry dates or\\n    some other goods, he should stay with him until he has\\n    been paid in full.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"This is the same situation as hiring out a\\n    specified riding-camel or hiring out a slave tailor,\\n    carpenter or some other kind of worker or letting a house\\n    and taking payment in advance for the hire of the slave\\n    or the rent of the house or camel. Then an accident\\n    happens to what has been hired resulting in death or\\n    something else. The owner of the camel, slave or house\\n    returns what remains of the rent of the camel, the hire\\n    of the slave or the rent of the house to the one who\\n    advanced him the money, and the owner reckons what will\\n    settle that up in full. If, for instance, he has provided\\n    half of what the man paid for, he returns the remaining\\n    half of what he advanced, or according to whatever amount\\n    is due.\" Malik said, \"Paying in advance for something\\n    which is on hand is only good when the buyer takes\\n    possession of what he has paid for as soon as he hands\\n    over the gold, whether it be slave, camel, or house, or\\n    in the case of dates, he starts to pick them as soon as\\n    he has paid the money.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    It is not good that there be any deferment or credit in\\n    such a transaction.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"An example illustrating what is disapproved\\n    of in this situation is that, for instance, a man may say\\n    that he will pay someone in advance for the use of his\\n    camel to ride in the hajj, and the hajj is still some\\n    time off, or he may say something similar to that about a\\n    slave or a house. When he does that, he only pays the\\n    money in advance on the understanding that if he finds\\n    the camel to be sound at the time the hire is due to\\n    begin, he will take it by virtue of what he has already\\n    paid. If an accident, or death, or something happens to\\n    the camel, then he will get his money back and the money\\n    he paid in advance will be considered as a loan.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"This is distinct from someone who takes\\n    immediate possession of what he rents or hires, so that\\n    it does not fall into the category of 'uncertainty,' or\\n    disapproved payment in advance. That is following a\\n    common practice. An example of that is that a man buys a\\n    slave, or slave-girl, and takes possession of them and\\n    pays their price. If something happens to them within the\\n    period of the year indemnification contract, he takes his\\n    gold back from the one from whom he bought it. There is\\n    no harm in that. This is the precedent of the sunna in\\n    the matter of selling slaves.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"Someone who rents a specified slave, or\\n    hires a specified camel, for a future date, at which time\\n    he will take possession of the camel or slave, has not\\n    acted properly because he did not take possession of what\\n    he rented or hired, nor is he advancing a loan which the\\n    person is responsible to pay back.\"\\n   </p>"

He does not buy anything\\n    else from the man for the same price until he has got\\n    back what he paid.

If delayed\\n    terms enter into the sale, there is no good in it.\\n    Bartering such things without precise measurement is like\\n    buying it with gold and silver without measuring\\n    precisely.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"That is because you buy wheat with silver\\n    without measuring precisely, and dates with gold without\\n    measuring precisely, and it is halal.

If the buyer wants to return that food to\\n    the seller, he can, because he concealed its measure and\\n    so it is an uncertain transaction. This is done with any\\n    kind of food or other goods whose measure and number the\\n    seller knows, and which he then sells without measurement\\n    and the buyer does not know that. If the buyer wants to\\n    return that to the seller, he can return t. The people of\\n    knowledge still forbid such a transaction.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"There is no good in selling one round loaf\\n    of bread for two round loaves, nor large for small when\\n    some of them are bigger than others. When care is taken\\n    that they are like for like, there is no harm in the\\n    sale, even if they are not weighed.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"It is not good to sell a mudd of butter and\\n    a mudd of milk for two mudds of butter. This is like what\\n    we described of selling dates when two sa of kabis and a\\n    sa of poor quality dates were sold for three sa of ajwa\\n    dates after the buyer had said to the seller, 'Two sa of\\n    kabis dates for three sa of ajwa dates is not good,' and\\n    then he did that to make the transaction possible. The\\n    owner of the milk puts the milk with his butter so that\\n    he can use the superiority of his butter over the butter\\n    of the other party to put his milk in with it.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"Flour for wheat is like for like, and there\\n    is no harm in that. That is if he does not mix up\\n    anything with the flour and sell it for wheat, like for\\n    like. Had he put half a mudd of flour and half of wheat,\\n    and then sold that for a mudd of wheat, it would be like\\n    what we described, and it would not be good because he\\n    would want to use the superiority of his good wheat to\\n    put flour along with it.

He takes possession\\n    of it and does not defer it because if he defers it, that\\n    is ugly and there enters into the transaction what is\\n    disapproved of: delay for delay. Delay for delay is to\\n    sell a debt against one man for a debt against another\\n    man.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"If someone advances for goods to be\\n    delivered after a time, and those goods are neither\\n    something to be eaten nor drunk, he can sell them to\\n    whomever he likes for cash or goods, before he takes\\n    delivery of them, to some one other than the person from\\n    whom he purchased them. He must not sell them to the\\n    person from whom he bought them except in exchange for\\n    goods which he takes possession of immediately and does\\n    not defer.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"If the delivery date for the goods has not\\n    arrived, there is no harm in selling them to the original\\n    owner for goods which are clearly different and which he\\n    takes immediate possession of and does not defer.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik spoke about the case of a man who advanced dinars\\n    or dirhams for four specified pieces of cloth to be\\n    delivered before a specified time and when the term fell\\n    due, he demanded delivery from the seller and the seller\\n    did not have them. He found that the seller had cloth but\\n    inferior quality, and the seller said that he would give\\n    him eight of those cloths. Malik said, \"There is no harm\\n    in that if he takes the cloths which he offers him before\\n    they separate. It is not good if delayed terms enter into\\n    the transaction. It is also not good if that is before\\n    the end of the term, unless he sells him cloth which is\\n    notthetypeof cloth for which he made an advance.\\n   </p>"

A man\\n    says, 'I will take him from you for twenty dinars.'

This transaction is greatly uncertain and\\n    risky.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"According to our way of doing things, one\\n    kind of uncertain transaction and risk is selling what is\\n    in the wombs of females - women and animals - because it\\n    is not known whether or not it will come out, and if it\\n    does come out, it is not known whether it will be\\n    beautiful or ugly, normal or disabled, male or female.\\n    All that is disparate. If it has that, its price is\\n    such-and-such, and if it has this, its price is\\n    such-and-such.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"Females must not be sold with what is in\\n    their wombs excluded. That is that, for instance, a man\\n    says to another, 'The price of my sheep which has much\\n    milk is three dinars. She is yours for two dinars while I\\n    will have her future offspring.'

This is an uncertain transaction because\\n    what comes from the ben-nut is ben-oil. There is no harm\\n    in selling ben-nuts for perfumed ben because perfumed ben\\n    has been perfumed, mixed and changed from the state of\\n    raw ben-nut oil.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik, speaking about a man who sold goods to a man on\\n    the provision that there was to be no loss for the buyer,\\n    (i.e. if the buyer could not re-sell the goods they could\\n    go back to the seller), said, \"This transaction is not\\n    permitted and it is part of risk. The explanation of why\\n    it is so, is that it is as if the seller hired the buyer\\n    for the profit if the goods make a profit. If he sells\\n    the stock at a loss, he has nothing, and his efforts are\\n    not compensated. This is not good. In such a transaction,\\n    the buyer should have a wage according to the work that\\n    he has contributed. Whatever there is of loss or profit\\n    in those goods is for and against the seller. This is\\n    only when the goods are gone and sold. If they do not go,\\n    the transaction between them is null and void.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"As for a man who buys goods from a man and\\n    he concludes the sale and then the buyer regrets and asks\\n    to have the price reduced and the seller refuses and\\n    says, 'Sell it and I will compensate you for any loss.'\\n    There is no harm in this because there is no risk. It is\\n    something he proposes to him, and their transaction was\\n    not based on that. That is what is done among us.\"\\n   </p>"

No doubt about it.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik spoke about a man who loaned one hundred dinars to\\n    a man for two terms. When it was due, the person who owed\\n    the debt said to him, \"Sell me some goods, whose price is\\n    one hundred dinars in cash for one hundred and fifty on\\n    credit.\" Malik said, \"This transaction is not good, and\\n    the people of knowledge still forbid it.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"This is disapproved of because the creditor\\n    himself gives the debtor the price of what the man sells\\n    him, and he defers repayment of the hundred of the first\\n    transaction for the debtor for the term which is\\n    mentioned to him in the second transaction, and the\\n    debtor increases him with fifty dinars for his deferring\\n    him. That is disapproved of and it is not good. It also\\n    resembles the hadith of Zayd ibn Aslam about the\\n    transactions of the people of the Jahiliyya. When their\\n    debts were due, they said to the person with the debt,\\n    'Either you pay in full or you increase it.' If they\\n    paid, they took it, and if not they increased debtors in\\n    their debts, and extended the term for them.\"\\n   </p>"

Then the seller failed him about the\\n    date, and the buyer wanted to return those goods to the\\n    seller. Malik said, \"The buyer cannot do that, and the\\n    sale is binding on him. If the seller does bring the\\n    goods before the completion of the term, the buyer cannot\\n    be forced to take them.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik spoke about a person who bought food and measured\\n    it. Then some one came to him to buy it and he told him\\n    that he had measured it for himself and taken it in full.\\n    The new buyer wanted to trust him and accept his measure.\\n    Malik said, -Whatever is sold in this way for cash has no\\n    harm in it but whatever is sold in this way on delayed\\n    terms is disapproved of until the new buyer measures it\\n    out for himself. The sale with delayed terms is\\n    disapproved of because it leads to usury and it is feared\\n    that it will be circulated in this way without weight or\\n    measure. If the terms are delayed it is disapproved of\\n    and there is no disagreement about that with us.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"One should not buy a debt owed by a man\\n    whether present or absent, without the confirmation of\\n    the one who owes the debt, nor should one buy a debt owed\\n    to a man by a dead person even if one knows what the\\n    deceased man has left. That is because to buy that is an\\n    uncertain transaction and one does not know whether the\\n    transaction will be completed or not completed.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    He said, \"The explanation of what is disapproved of in\\n    buying a debt owed by someone absent or dead, is that it\\n    is not known what unknown debtor may be connected to the\\n    dead person. If the dead person is liable for another\\n    debt, the price which the buyer gave on strength of the\\n    debt may become worthless.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"There is another fault in that as well. He\\n    is buying something which is not guaranteed for him, and\\n    so if the deal is not completed, what he paid becomes\\n    worthless. This is an uncertain transaction and it is not\\n    good.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"One distinguishes between a man who is only\\n    selling what he actually has and a man who is being paid\\n    in advance for something which is not yet in his\\n    possession. The man advancing the money brings his gold\\n    which he intends to buy with. The seller says, 'This is\\n    10 dinars. What do you want me to buy for you with it?'\\n    It is as if he sold 10 dinars cash for 15 dinars to be\\n    paid later. Because of this, it is disapproved of. It is\\n    something leading to usury and fraud.\"\\n   </p>"

Share-cropping is conducted on the\\n    basis that all the care and expense is outlayed by the\\n    share-cropper, and the owner of the property is not\\n    obliged anything. This is the accepted method of\\n    share-cropping.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik spoke about a spring which was shared between two\\n    men, and then the water dried up and one of them wanted\\n    to work on the spring and the other said, \"I don't have\\n    the means to work on it.\" He said, \"Tell the one who\\n    wants to work on the spring, 'Work and expend.

If he\\n    brings you half of what you have spent, he can take his\\n    share of the water.' The first one is given all the\\n    water, because he has spent on it, and if he does not\\n    reach anything by his work, the other has not incurred\\n    any expense.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, -It is not good for a share-cropper not to\\n    expend anything but his labour and to be hired for a\\n    share of the fruit while all the expense and work is\\n    incurred by the owner of the garden, because the\\n    share-cropper does not know what the exact wage is going\\n    to be for his labour, whether it will be little or\\n    great.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"No-one who lends a qirad or grants a\\n    share-cropping contract, should exempt some of the\\n    wealth, or some of the trees from his agent, because, by\\n    that, the agent becomes his hired man. He says, 'I will\\n    grant you a share-crop provided that you work for me on\\n    such-and-such a palm - water it and tend it. I will give\\n    you a qirad for such-and-such money provided that you\\n    work for me with ten dinars. They are not part of the\\n    qirad I have given you.' That must not be done and it is\\n    not good. This is what is done in our community.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The sunna about what is permitted to an\\n    owner of a garden in share-cropping is that he can\\n    stipulate to the share-cropper the maintenance of walls,\\n    cleaning the spring, sweeping the irrigation canals,\\n    pollinating the palms, pruning branches, harvesting the\\n    fruit and such things, provided that the share-cropper\\n    has a share of the fruit fixed by mutual agreement.\\n    However, the owner cannot stipulate the beginning of new\\n    work which the agent will start digging a well, raising\\n    the source of a well, instigating new planting, or\\n    building a cistern whose cost is great. That is as if the\\n    owner of the garden said to a certain man, 'Build me a\\n    house here or dig me a well or make a spring flow for me\\n    or do some work for me for half the fruit of this garden\\n    of mine,' before the fruit of the garden is sound and it\\n    is halal to sell it. This is the sale of fruit before its\\n    good condition is clear. The Messenger of Allah, may\\n    Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade fruit to be\\n    sold before its good condition became clear.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"If the fruits are good and their good\\n    condition is clear and selling them is halal and then the\\n    owner asks a man to do one of those jobs for him,\\n    specifying the job, for half the fruit of his garden, for\\n    example, there is no harm in that. He has hired the man\\n    for something recognised and known. The man has seen it\\n    and is satisfied with it.\\n   </p><p>\\n    \"As for share-cropping, if the garden has no fruit or\\n    little or bad fruit, he has only that. The labourer is\\n    only hired for a set amount, and hire is only permitted\\n    on these terms. Hire is a type of sale. One man buys\\n    another man's work from him. It is not good if\\n    uncertainty enters into it because the Messenger of\\n    Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade\\n    uncertain transactions.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The sunna in share-cropping with us is that\\n    it can be practised with any kind of fruit tree, palm,\\n    vine, olive tree, pomegranate, peach, and soon. It is\\n    permitted, and there is no harm in it provided that the\\n    owner of the property has a share of the fruit: a half or\\n    a third or a quarter or whatever.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"Share-cropping is also permitted in any crop\\n    which emerges from the earth if it is a crop which is\\n    picked, and its owner cannot water, work on it and tend\\n    it.\\n   </p><p>\\n    \"Share-cropping becomes reprehensible in anything in\\n    which share-cropping is normally permitted if the fruit\\n    is sound and the good condition is clear and it is halal\\n    to sell it. He must share-crop in it the next year. If a\\n    man waters fruit whose good condition is clear and it is\\n    halal to sell it, and he picks it for the owner, for a\\n    share of the crop -it is not sharecropping. It is similar\\n    to him being paid in dirhams and dinars. Share-cropping\\n    is what is between pruning the palms and when the fruit\\n    becomes sound and its sale is halal.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"If some one makes a share-cropping contract\\n    for fruit trees before the condition becomes clear and\\n    its sale is halal, it is share-cropping and is permitted\\n    . \"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"Uncultivated land must not be involved in a\\n    share-cropping contract. That is because it is halal for\\n    the owner to rent it for dinars and dirhams or the\\n    equivalent for an accepted price.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"As for a man who gives his uncultivated\\n    earth for a third or a fourth of what comes out of it,\\n    that is an uncertain transaction because crops may be\\n    scant one time and plentiful another time. It may perish\\n    completely and the owner of the land will have abandoned\\n    a set rent which would have been good for him to rent the\\n    land for. He takes an uncertain situation, and does not\\n    know whether or not it will be satisfactory. This is\\n    disapproved. It is like a man having someone travel for\\n    him for a set amount, and then saying, 'Shall I give you\\n    a tenth of the profit of the journey as your wage?' This\\n    is not halal and must not be done.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik summed up,\"A man must not hire out himself or his\\n    land or his ship unless for a set amount.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"A distinction is made between sharecropping\\n    in palms and in cultivated land because the owner of the\\n    palms cannot sell the fruit until its good condition is\\n    clear. The owner of the land can rent it when it is\\n    uncultivated with nothing on it.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"What is done in our community about palms is\\n    that they can also be share-cropped for three and four\\n    years, and less or more than that.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"That is what I have heard. Any fruit trees\\n    like that are in the position of palms. Contracts for\\n    several years are permissible for the sharecropper as\\n    they are permissible in the palms.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said about the owner, \"He does not take anything\\n    additional from the share-cropper in the way of gold or\\n    silver or crops which increases him. That is not good.\\n    The share-cropper also must not take from the owner of\\n    the garden anything additional which will increase him of\\n    gold, silver, crops or anything. Increase beyond what is\\n    stipulated in the contract is not good. It is also not\\n    good for the lender of a qirad to be in this position. If\\n    such an increase does enter share-cropping or quirad, it\\n    becomes by it hire. It is not good when hire enters it.\\n    Hire must never occur in a situation which has\\n    uncertainty in it.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik spoke about a man who gave land to another man in a\\n    share-cropping contract in which there were palms, vines,\\n    or the like of that of fruit trees and there was also\\n    uncultivated land in it. He said, \"If the uncultivated\\n    land is secondary to the fruit trees, either in\\n    importance or in size of land, there is no harm in\\n    share-cropping. That is if the palms take up two-thirds\\n    of the land or more, and the uncultivated land is a third\\n    or less. This is because when the land that the fruit\\n    trees take up is secondary to the uncultivated land and\\n    the cultivated land in which the palms, vines or the like\\n    is a third or less, and the uncultivated land is\\n    two-thirds or more, it is permitted to rent the land and\\n    share-cropping in it is haram.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    \"One of the practices of people is to give out\\n    sharecropping contracts on property with fruit trees when\\n    there is uncultivated land in it, and to rent land while\\n    there are fruit trees on it, just as a Qur'an or sword\\n    which has some embellishment on it of silver is sold for\\n    silver, or a necklace or ring which have stones and gold\\n    in them are sold for dinars. These sales continue to be\\n    permitted. People buy and sell by them. Nothing described\\n    or instituted has come on that which if exceeded, makes\\n    it haram, and if fallen below makes it halal. What is\\n    done in our community about that is what people practise\\n    and permit among themselves. That is, if the gold or\\n    silver is secondary to what it is incorporated in, it is\\n    permitted to sell it. That is, if the value of the blade,\\n    the Qur'an, or the stones is two-thirds or more, and the\\n    value of the decoration is one-third or less.\"\\n   </p>"

Then another partner decided to exercise his\\n    right of pre-emption after that, and he found that the\\n    slave or slave-girl had died, and no one knew what her\\n    value had been.

If someone makes a gift of\\n    his portion of a shared house or land, and does not take\\n    any remuneration and does not seek to, and a partner\\n    wants to take it for its value, he cannot do so as long\\n    as the original partner has not been given recompense for\\n    it.

Even if he is a way for a long time,\\n    there is no time limit after which the right of\\n    preemption is cut off.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said that if a man left land to a number of his\\n    children, then one of them who had a child died and the\\n    child of the deceased sold his right in that land, the\\n    brother of the seller was more entitled to pre-empt him\\n    than his paternal uncles, the partners of his father.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"This is what is done in our community.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"Pre-emption is shared between partners\\n    according to their existing shares.

If not, he has nothing.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik spoke about a man who bought land, and developed it\\n    by planting trees or digging a well etc., and then\\n    someone came, and seeing that he had a right in the land,\\n    wanted to take possession of it by pre-emption. Malik\\n    said \"He has no right of preemption unless he compensates\\n    the other for his expenditure. If he gives him the price\\n    of what he has developed, he is entitled to pre-emption .\\n    If not, he has no right in it.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said that someone who sold off his portion of a\\n    shared house or land and then, on learning that some one\\n    with a right of pre-emption was to take possession by\\n    that right, asked the buyer to revoke the sale, and he\\n    did so, did not have the right to do that.

Each thing the man bought is assessed\\n    according to its share of the lump sum the man paid. Then\\n    the pre-emptor takes possession of his right for a price\\n    which is appropriate on that basis. He does not take any\\n    animals or goods unless he wants to do that.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"If someone sells a section of shared land,\\n    and one of those who have the right of preemption\\n    surrenders it to the buyer and another refuses to do\\n    other than take his pre-emption, the one who refuses to\\n    surrender has to take all the preemption, and he cannot\\n    take according to his right and leave what remains.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In the case where one of a number of partners in one\\n    house sold his share when all his partners were away\\n    except for one man, the one present was given the choice\\n    of either taking the pre-emption or leaving it, and he\\n    said, 'I will take my portion and leave the portions of\\n    my partners until they are present. If they take it, that\\n    is that. If they leave it, I will take all the\\n    pre-emption,' Malik said, 'He can only take it all or\\n    leave it. If his partners come, they can take from him or\\n    leave it as they wish. If this is offered to him and he\\n    does not accept, I think that he has no pre-emption.' \"\\n   </p>"

The owner of\\n    pre-emption takes possession after that is included.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"Pre-emption is applied to the property of\\n    the deceased as it is applied to the property of the\\n    living. If the family of the deceased fear to break up\\n    the property of the deceased, then they share it and sell\\n    it, and they have no pre-emption in it.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"There is no pre-emption among us in a slave\\n    or a slave-girl or a camel, a cow, sheep, or any animal,\\n    nor in clothes or a well which does not have any\\n    uncultivated land around it.

Had it been as he said, a slave could take an\\n    oath with one witness, if he could find one, that his\\n    master had freed him.\\n   </p><p>\\n    \"However, when a slave lays claim to a piece of property,\\n    he can take an oath with one witness and demand his right\\n    as the freeman demands his right.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The sunna with us is that when a slave\\n    brings somebody who witnesses that he has been set free,\\n    his master is made to take an oath that he has not freed\\n    him, and the slave's claim is dropped.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The sunna about divorce is also like that\\n    with us. When a woman brings somebody who witnesses that\\n    her husband has divorced her, the husband is made to take\\n    an oath that he has not divorced her. If he takes the\\n    oath, the divorce does not proceed . \"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"There is only one sunna of bringing a\\n    witness in cases of divorce and freeing a slave. The\\n    right to make an oath only belongs to the husband of the\\n    woman, and the master of the slave. Freeing is a hadd\\n    matter, and the testimony of women is not permitted in it\\n    because when a slave is freed, his inviolability is\\n    affirmed and the hadd punishments are applied for and\\n    against him. If he commits fornication and he is a\\n    muhsan, he is stoned. If he kills a slave, he is killed\\n    for it. Inheritance is established for him, between him\\n    and whoever inherits from him. If somebody disputes this,\\n    arguing that if a man frees his slave and then a man\\n    comes to demand from the master of the slave payment of a\\n    debt, and a man and two women testify to his right, that\\n    establishes the right against the master of the slave so\\n    that his freeing him is cancelled if he only has the\\n    slave as property, inferring by this case that the\\n    testimony of women is permitted in cases of setting free.\\n    The case is not as he suggests (i.e. it is a case of\\n    property not freeing). It is like a man who frees his\\n    slave, and then the claimant of a debt comes to the\\n    master and takes an oath with one witness, demanding his\\n    right. By that, the freeing of the slave would be\\n    cancelled. Or else a man comes who has frequent dealings\\n    and transactions with the master of the slave. He claims\\n    that he is owed money by the master of the slave. Someone\\n    says to the master of the slave, 'Take an oath that you\\n    don't owe what he claims'. If he draws back and refuses\\n    to take an oath, the one making the claim takes an oath\\n    and his right against the master of the slave is\\n    confirmed. That would cancel the freeing of the slave if\\n    it is confirmed that property is owed by the master.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"It is the same case with a man who marries a\\n    slave-girl and then the master of the slave-girl comes to\\n    the man who has married her and claims, 'You and\\n    so-and-so have bought my slave-girl from me for such an\\n    amount of dinars. The husband of the slave-girl denies\\n    that. The master of the slave-girl brings a man and two\\n    women and they testify to what he has said. The sale is\\n    confirmed and his claim is considered true. So the\\n    slave-girl is haram for her husband and they have to\\n    separate, even though the testimony of women is not\\n    accepted in divorce.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"It is also the same case with a man who\\n    accuses a free man, so the hadd falls on him. A man and\\n    two women come and testify that the one accused is a\\n    slave. That would remove the hadd from the accused after\\n    it had befallen him, even though the testimony of women\\n    is not accepted in accusations involving hadd\\n    punishments.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"Another similar case in which judgement\\n    appears to go against the precedent of the sunna is that\\n    two women testify that a child is born alive and so it is\\n    necessary for him to inherit if a situation arises where\\n    he is entitled to inherit, and the child's property goes\\n    to those who inherit from him, if he dies, and it is not\\n    necessary that the two women witnesses should be\\n    accompanied by a man or an oath even though it may\\n    involve vast properties of gold, silver, live-stock,\\n    gardens and slaves and other properties. However, had two\\n    women testified to one dirham or more or less than that\\n    in a property case, their testimony would not affect\\n    anything and would not be permitted unless there was a\\n    witness or an oath with them.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"There are people who say that an oath is not\\n    acceptable with only one witness and they argue by the\\n    word of Allah the Blessed, the Exalted, and His word is\\n    the Truth, 'And call in to witness two witnesses, men; or\\n    if the two be not men, then one man and two women, such\\n    witnesses as you approve of.' (Sura 2 ayat 282). Such\\n    people argue that if he does not bring one man and two\\n    women, he has no claim and he is not allowed to take an\\n    oath with one witness.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"Part of the proof against those who argue\\n    this, is to reply to them, 'Do you think that if a man\\n    claimed property from a man, the one claimed from would\\n    not swear that the claim was false?' If he swears, the\\n    claim against him is dropped. If he refuses to take an\\n    oath, the claimant is made to take an oath that his claim\\n    is true, and his right against his companion is\\n    established. There is no dispute about this with any of\\n    the people nor in any country. By what does he take this?\\n    In what place in the Book of Allah does he find it? So if\\n    he confirms this, let him confirm the oath with one\\n    witness, even if it is not in the Book of Allah, the\\n    Mighty, the Majestic! It is enough that this is the\\n    precedent of the sunna. However, man wants to recognise\\n    the proper course of action and the location of the\\n    proof. In this there is a clarification for what is\\n    obscure about that, if Allah ta'ala wills.\"\\n   </p>"

If he doesn't have the\\n    money, he partially frees him.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The generally agreed-on way of doing things\\n    among us in the case of slave whose master makes a\\n    bequest to free part of him - a third, a fourth, a half,\\n    or any share after his death, is that only the portion of\\n    him is freed that his master has named. This is because\\n    the freeing of that portion is only obliged to take place\\n    after the death of the master because the master has the\\n    option to withdraw the bequest as long as he lives. When\\n    the slave is freed from his master, the master is a\\n    testator and the testator only has access to free what he\\n    can take from his property, being the third of the\\n    property he is allowed to bequeath, and the rest of the\\n    slave is not free because the man's property has gone out\\n    of his hands. How can the rest of the slave which belongs\\n    to other people be free when they did not initiate the\\n    setting free and did not confirm it and they do not have\\n    the wala' established for them? Only the deceased could\\n    do that. He was the one who freed him and the one for\\n    whom the wala' was confirmed. That is not to be borne by\\n    another's property unless he bequeaths within the third\\n    of his property what remains of a lave to be freed. That\\n    is a request against his partners and inheritors and the\\n    partners must not refuse the slave that when it is within\\n    the third of the dead man's property because there is no\\n    harm in that to the inheritors.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"If a man frees a third of his slave while he\\n    is critically ill, he must complete the emancipation so\\n    all of him is free from him, if it is within the third of\\n    his property that he has access to, because he is not\\n    treated in the same way as a man who frees a third of a\\n    slave after his death, because had the one who freed a\\n    third of his slave after his death lived, he could have\\n    cancelled it and the slave's being set free would be of\\n    no effect. The master who made the freeing of the third\\n    of the slave irrevocable in his illness, would still have\\n    to free all of him if he lived. If he died, the slave\\n    would be set free within the third of the bequest. That\\n    is because the command of the deceased is permissible in\\n    his third as the command of the healthy is permissible in\\n    all his property.\"\\n   </p>"

                "text": "<p>\\n    Malik related to me from Rabia ibn Abd ar-Rahman that\\n    az-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam bought a slave and set him free.\\n    The slave had children by a free woman. When az-Zubayr\\n    freed him, he said, \"They are my mawali.\" The man argued,\\n    \"They are the mawali of their mother. Rather, they are\\n    our mawali.\" They took the dispute to Uthman ibn Affan,\\n    and Uthman gave a judgement that az-Zubayr had their\\n    wala'.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik related to me that he had heard that Said ibn\\n    al-Musayyab was asked who had the wala' of the children\\n    whom a slave had by a free woman. Said said, \"If their\\n    father dies and he is a slave who was not set free, their\\n    wala' belongs to the mawali of their mother.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"That is like the child of a woman who is a\\n    mawla who has been divorced by lian; the child is\\n    attached to the mawali of his mother and they are his\\n    mawali. If he dies, they inherit from him. If he commits\\n    a crime, they pay the blood-money for him. If his father\\n    acknowledges him, he is given a kinship to him and his\\n    wala' goes to the mawali of his father. They are his\\n    heirs, they pay his blood-money and his father is\\n    punished with the hadd-punishment.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"It is like that with a free-born woman\\n    divorced by lian. If her husband who curses her by lian\\n    does not acknowledge her child, the child is dealt with\\n    in the same way except that the rest of his inheritance\\n    after the inheritance of his mother and his brothers from\\n    his mother goes to all the muslims as long as he was not\\n    given kinship to his father. The child of the lian is\\n    attached to the patronage of the mawali of his mother\\n    until his father acknowledges him because he does not\\n    have a lineage or paternal relations. If his lineage is\\n    confirmed, it goes to his paternal relations.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The generally agreed-on way of doing things\\n    among us about a child of a slave by a free woman, while\\n    the father of the slave is free, is that the grandfather\\n    (the father of the slave), attracts the wala' of his\\n    son's free children by a free woman. They leave their\\n    inheritance to him as long as their father is a slave. If\\n    the father becomes free, the wala' returns to his mawali.\\n    If he dies and he is still a slave, the inheritance and\\n    the wala' go to the grandfather. If the slave has two\\n    free sons, and one of them dies while the father is still\\n    a slave, the grandfather, the father of the father,\\n    attracts the wala' and the inheritance.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik spoke about a slave-girl who was set free while she\\n    was pregnant and her husband was a slave and then her\\n    husband became free before she gave birth, or after she\\n    gave birth. He said, \"The wala' of what is in her womb\\n    goes to the person who set the mother free because\\n    slavery touched the child before the mother was set free.\\n    It is not treated in the same way as a child conceived by\\n    its mother after she has been set free because the wala'\\n    of such a child, is attracted by the father when he is\\n    set free.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said that if a slave asked his master's permission\\n    to free a slave of his and his master gave permission,\\n    the wala' of the freed slave went to the master of his\\n    master, and his wala' did not return to the master who\\n    had set him free, even if he were to become free\\n    himself.\"\\n   </p>"

Then divide what remains of the property between\\n    the daughter and the master.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"What is done among us is that the master of\\n    a slave does not have to give his slave a kitaba if he\\n    asks for it. I have not heard of any of the Imams forcing\\n    a man to give a kitaba to his slave. I heard that one of\\n    the people of knowledge, when someone asked about that\\n    and mentioned that Allah the Blessed, the Exalted, said,\\n    'Give them their kitaba, if you know some good in them'\\n    (Sura 24 ayat 33) recited these two ayats, 'When you are\\n    free of the state of ihram, then hunt for game.'

He\\n    belonged to the master. As for the slave-girl, she\\n    belonged to the mukatab because she was his property.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said that if a man and his wife's son (by another\\n    husband) inherited a mukatab from the wife and the\\n    mukatab died before he had completed his kitaba, they\\n    divided his inheritance between them according to the\\n    Book of Allah. If the slave paid his kitaba and then\\n    died, his inheritance went to the son of the woman, and\\n    the husband had nothing of his inheritance.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said that if a mukatab gave his own slave a kitaba,\\n    the situation was looked at. If he wanted to do his slave\\n    a favour and it was obvious by his making it easy for\\n    him, that was not permitted. If he was giving him a\\n    kitaba from desire to find money to pay off his own\\n    kitaba, that was permitted for him.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said that if a man had intercourse with a mukataba\\n    of his and she became pregnant by him, she had an option.\\n    If she liked she could be an umm walad. If she wished,\\n    she could confirm her kitaba. If she did not conceive,\\n    she still had her kitaba.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The generally agreed on way of doing things\\n    among us about a slave who is owned by two men is that\\n    one of them does not give a kitaba for his share, whether\\n    or not his companion gives him permission to do so,\\n    unless they both write the kitaba together, because that\\n    alone would effect setting him free. If the slave were to\\n    fulfil what he had agreed on to free half of himself, and\\n    then the one who had given a kitaba for half of him was\\n    not obliged to complete his setting free, that would be\\n    in opposition to the words of the Messenger of Allah, may\\n    Allah bless him and grant him peace. 'If someone frees\\n    his share in a slave and has enough money to cover the\\n    full price of the slave, justly evaluated for him, he\\n    must give his partners their shares, so the slave is\\n    completely free . ' \"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"If he is not aware of that until the mukatab\\n    has met the terms or before he has met them the owner who\\n    has written him the kitaba returns what he has taken from\\n    the mukatab to him, and then he and his partner divide\\n    him according to their original shares and the kitaba is\\n    invalid. He is the slave of both of them in his original\\n    state.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik spoke about a mukatab who was owned by two men and\\n    one of them granted him a delay in the payment of the\\n    right which he was owed, and the other refused to defer\\n    it, and so the one who refused to defer the payment\\n    exacted his part of the due. Malik said that if the\\n    mukatab then died and left property which did not\\n    complete his kitaba, \"They divide it according to what\\n    they are still owed by him. Each of them takes according\\n    to his share. If the mukatab leaves more than his kitaba,\\n    each of them takes what remains to them of the kitaba,\\n    and what remains after that is divided equally between\\n    them. If the mukatab is unable to pay his kitaba fully\\n    and the one who did not allow him to defer his payment\\n    has exacted more than his associate did, the slave is\\n    still divided equally between them, and he does not\\n    return to his associates the excess of what he has\\n    exacted, because he only exacted his right with the\\n    permission of his associate. If one of them remits what\\n    is owed to him and then his associate exacts part of what\\n    he is owed by him and then the mukatab is unable to pay,\\n    he belongs to both of them. And the one who has exacted\\n    something does not return anything because he only\\n    demanded what he was owed. That is like the debt of two\\n    men in one writing against one man. One of them grants\\n    him time to pay and the other is greedy and exacts his\\n    due. Then the debtor goes bankrupt. The one who exacted\\n    his due does not have to return any of what he took.\"\\n   </p>"

This is not part of the sunna\\n    of the muslims. That is because when a man assumes\\n    responsibility to the master of a mukatab for what the\\n    mukatab owes of his kitaba, and then the master of the\\n    mukatab pursues that from the one who assumes the\\n    responsibility, he takes his money falsely. It is not as\\n    if he is buying the mukatab, so that what he gives is\\n    part of the price of something that is his, and neither\\n    is the mukatab being freed so that the price established\\n    for him buys his inviolability as a free man. If the\\n    mukatab is unable to meet the payments he reverts to his\\n    master and is his slave. That is because kitaba is not a\\n    fixed debt which can be assumed by the master of the\\n    mukatab. It is something which, when it is paid by the\\n    mukatab, sets him free. If the mukatab dies and has a\\n    debt, his master is not one of the creditors for what\\n    remains unpaid of the kitaba. The creditors have\\n    precedence over the master. If the mukatab cannot meet\\n    the payments, and he owes debts to people, he reverts to\\n    being a slave owned by his master and the debts to the\\n    people are the liability of the mukatab. The creditors do\\n    not enter with the master into any share of the price of\\n    his person.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"When people are written together in one\\n    kitaba and there is no kinship between them by which they\\n    inherit from each other, and some of them are responsible\\n    for others, then none of them are freed before the others\\n    until all the kitaba has been paid. If one of them dies\\n    and leaves property and it is more than all of what is\\n    against them, it pays all that is against them . The\\n    excess of the property goes to the master, and none of\\n    those who have been written in the kitaba with the\\n    deceased have any of the excess. The master's claims are\\n    overshadowed by their claims for the portions which\\n    remain against them of the kitaba which can be fulfilled\\n    from the property of the deceased, because the deceased\\n    had assumed their responsibility and they must use his\\n    property to pay for their freedom. If the deceased\\n    mukatab has a free child not born in kitaba and who was\\n    not written in the kitaba, it does not inherit from him\\n    because the mukatab was not freed until he died.\"\\n   </p>"

That is because the\\n    slave and his property are owned by both of them, and so\\n    one of them is not permitted to take any of the property\\n    except with the consent of his partner. If one of them\\n    settled with the mukatab and his partner did not, and he\\n    took the agreed price, and then the mukatab died while he\\n    had property or was unable to pay, the one who settled\\n    would not have anything of the mukatab's property and he\\n    could not return that for which he made settlement so\\n    that his right to the slave's person would return to him.\\n    However, when someone settles with a mukatab with the\\n    permission of his partner and then the mukatab is unable\\n    to pay, it is preferable that the one who broke with him\\n    return what he has taken from the mukatab for the\\n    severance and he can have back his portion of the\\n    mukatab. He can do that. If the mukatab dies and leaves\\n    property, the partner who has kept hold of the kitaba is\\n    paid in full the amount of the kitaba which remains to\\n    him against the mukatab from the mukatab's property. Then\\n    what remains of property of the mukatab is between the\\n    partner who broke with him and his partner, according to\\n    their shares in the mukatab. If one of the partners\\n    breaks off with him and the other keeps the kitaba, and\\n    the mukatab is unable to pay, it is said to the partner\\n    who settled with him, 'If you wish to give your partner\\n    half of what you took so the slave is divided between\\n    you, then do so.

Then the one who retained\\n    possession of the slave demanded the like of that for\\n    which his partner had settled or more than that and the\\n    mukatab could not pay it. He said, \"The mukatab is shared\\n    between them because the man has only demanded what is\\n    owed to him. If he demands less than what the one who\\n    settled with him took and the mukatab can not manage\\n    that, and the one who settled with him prefers to return\\n    to his partner half of what he took so the slave is\\n    divided in halves between them, he can do that. If he\\n    refuses then all of the slave belongs to the one who did\\n    not settle with him. If the mukatab dies and leaves\\n    property, and the one who settled with him prefers to\\n    return to his companion half of what he has taken so the\\n    inheritance is divided between them, he can do that. If\\n    the one who has kept the kitaba takes the like of what\\n    the one who has settled with him took, or more, the\\n    inheritance is between them according to their shares in\\n    the slave because he is only taking his right.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik spoke about a mukatab who was shared between two\\n    men and one of them made a settlement with him for half\\n    of what was due to him with the permission of his\\n    partner, and then the one who retained possession of the\\n    slave took less than what his partner settled with him\\n    for and the mukatab was unable to pay. He said, \"If the\\n    one who made a settlement with the slave prefers to\\n    return half of what he was awarded to his partner, the\\n    slave is divided between them. If he refuses to return\\n    it, the one who retained possession has the portion of\\n    the share for which his partner made a settlement with\\n    the mukatab.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The explanation of that is that the slave is\\n    divided in two halves between them. They write him a\\n    kitaba together and then one of them makes a settlement\\n    with the mukatab for half his due with the permission of\\n    his partner. That is a fourth of all the slave. Then the\\n    mukatab is unable to continue, so it is said to the one\\n    who settled with him, 'If you wish, return to your\\n    partner half of what you were awarded and the slave is\\n    divided equally between you.' If he refuses, the one who\\n    held to the kitaba takes in full the fourth of his\\n    partner for which he made settlement with the mukatab. He\\n    had half the slave, so that now gives him three-fourths\\n    of the slave. The one who broke off has a fourth of the\\n    slave because he refused to return the equivalent of the\\n    fourth share for which he settled.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik spoke about a mukatab whose master made a\\n    settlement with him and set him free and what remained of\\n    his severance was written against him as debt, then the\\n    mukatab died and people had debts against him. He said,\\n    \"His master does not share with the creditors because of\\n    what he is owed from the severance. The creditors begin\\n    first.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"A mukatab cannot break with his master when\\n    he owes debts to people. He would be set free and have\\n    nothing because the people who hold the debts are more\\n    entitled to his property than his master. That is not\\n    permitted for him.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"According to the way things are done among\\n    us, there is no harm if a man gives a kitaba to his slave\\n    and settles with him for gold and reduces what he is owed\\n    of the kitaba provided that only the gold is paid\\n    immediately. Whoever disapproves of that does so because\\n    he puts it in the category of a debt which a man has\\n    against another man for a set term. He gives him a\\n    reduction and he pays it immediately. This is not like\\n    that debt. The breaking of the mukatab with his master is\\n    dependent on his giving money to speed up the setting\\n    free. Inheritance, testimony and the hudud are obliged\\n    for him and the inviolability of being set free is\\n    established for him. He is not buying dirhams for dirhams\\n    or gold for gold. Rather it is like a man who having said\\n    to his slave, 'Bring me such-and-such an amount of dinars\\n    and you are free', then reduces that for him, saying, 'If\\n    you bring me less than that, you are free.' That is not a\\n    fixed debt. Had it been a fixed debt, the master would\\n    have shared with the creditors of the mukatab when he\\n    died or went bankrupt. His claim on the property of the\\n    mukatab would join theirs.\"\\n   </p>"

If he cannot do that, and he cannot\\n    pay his kitaba because he must pay the blood-money of\\n    that injury before the kitaba, and he cannot pay the\\n    blood-money of that injury, then his master has an\\n    option. If he prefers to pay the blood-money of that\\n    injury, he does so and keeps his slave and he becomes an\\n    owned slave.

If\\n    they pay, they are confirmed in their kitaba. If they do\\n    not pay, and they are incapable then their master has an\\n    option. If he wishes, he can pay all the blood-money of\\n    that injury and all the slaves revert to him. If he\\n    wishes, he can surrender the one who did the injury alone\\n    and all the others revert to being his slaves since they\\n    could not pay the blood-money of the injury which their\\n    companion caused.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The way of doing things about which there is\\n    no dispute among us, is that when a mukatab is injured in\\n    some way which entails blood-money or one of the\\n    mukatab's children who is written with him in the kitaba\\n    is injured, their blood-money is the blood-money of\\n    slaves of their value, and what is appointed to them as\\n    their blood-money is paid to the master who has the\\n    kitaba and he reckons that for the mukatab at the end of\\n    his kitaba and there is a reduction for the blood-money\\n    that the master has taken for the injury.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The explanation of that is say, for example,\\n    he has written his kitaba for three thousand dirhams and\\n    the blood-money taken by the master for his injury is one\\n    thousand dirhams. When the mukatab has paid his master\\n    two thousand dirhams he is free. If what remains of his\\n    kitaba is one thousand dirhams and the blood-money for\\n    his injury is one thousand dirhams, he is free\\n    straightaway. If the blood-money of the injury is more\\n    than what remains of the kitaba, the master of the\\n    mukatab takes what remains of his kitaba and frees him.\\n    What remains after the payment of the kitaba belongs to\\n    the mukatab. One must not pay the mukatab any of the\\n    blood-money of his injury in case he might consume it and\\n    use it up. If he could not pay his kitaba completely he\\n    would then return to his master one eyed, with a hand cut\\n    off, or crippled in body.

That\\n    is because his buying himself is his freedom, and freedom\\n    has priority over what bequests accompany it. If one of\\n    those who have written the kitaba for the mukatab sells\\n    his portion of him, so that a half, a third, a fourth, or\\n    whatever share of the mukatab is sold, the mukatab does\\n    not have the right of pre-emption in what is sold of him.\\n    That is because it is like the severance of a partner,\\n    and a partner can only make a settlement for a partner of\\n    the one who is mukatab with the permission of his\\n    partners because what is sold of him does not give him\\n    complete rights as a free man and his property is barred\\n    from him, and by buying part of himself, it is feared\\n    that he will become incapable of completing payment\\n    because of what he had to spend.

If he dies or goes bankrupt and he owes\\n    debts to people, then the person who bought his\\n    instalment does not take any of his portion with the\\n    creditors. The person who buys one of the instalments of\\n    the mukatab is in the position of the master of the\\n    mukatab. The master of the mukatab does not have a share\\n    with the creditors of the mukatab for what he is owed of\\n    the kitaba of his slave. It is also like that with the\\n    kharaj, (a set amount deducted daily from the slave\\n    against his earnings), which accumulates for a master\\n    from the earnings of his slave.

One does not look at the number of\\n    dirhams which remain against him in his kitaba. That is\\n    because had he been killed, his killer would not be in\\n    debt for other than his value on the day he killed him.\\n    Had he been injured, the one who injured him would not be\\n    liable for other than the blood-money of the injury on\\n    the day of his injury. One does not look at how much he\\n    has paid of dinars and dirhams of the contract he has\\n    written because he is a slave as long as any of his\\n    kitaba remains. If what remains in his kitaba is less\\n    than his value, only whatever of his kitaba remains owing\\n    from him is taken into account in the third of the\\n    property of the deceased. That is because the deceased\\n    left him what remains of his kitaba and so it becomes a\\n    bequest which the deceased made.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The illustration of that is that if the\\n    price of the mukatab is one thousand dirhams, and only\\n    one hundred dirhams remain of his kitaba, his master\\n    leaves him the one hundred dirhams which complete it for\\n    him. It is taken into account in the third of his master\\n    and by it he becomes free.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said that if a man wrote his slave a kitaba at his\\n    death, the value of the slave was estimated. If there was\\n    enough to cover the price of the slave in one third of\\n    his property, that was permitted for him.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The illustration of that is that the price\\n    of the slave is one thousand dinars. His master writes\\n    him a kitaba for two hundred dinars at his death. The\\n    third of the property of his master is one thousand\\n    dinars, so that is permitted for him. It is only a\\n    bequest which he makes from one third of his property. If\\n    the master has left bequests to people, and there is no\\n    surplus in the third after the value of the mukatab, one\\n    begins with the mukatab because the kitaba is setting\\n    free, and setting free has priority over bequests. When\\n    those bequests are paid from the kitaba of the mukatab,\\n    they follow it. The heirs of the testator have a choice.\\n    If they want to give the people with bequests all their\\n    bequests and the kitaba of the mukatab is theirs, they\\n    have that. If they refuse and hand over the mukatab and\\n    what he owes to the people with bequests they can do\\n    that, because the third commences with the mukatab and\\n    because all the bequests which he makes are as one.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    If the heirs then say, \"What our fellow bequeathed was\\n    more than one third of his property and he has taken what\\n    was not his,\" Malik said, \"His heirs choose. It is said\\n    to them, 'Your companion has made the bequests you know\\n    about and if you would like to give them to those who are\\n    to receive them according to the deceased's bequests,\\n    then do so. If not, hand over to the people with bequests\\n    one third of the total property of the deceased.' \"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik continued, \"If the heirs surrender the mukatab to\\n    the people with bequests, the people with bequests have\\n    what he owes of his kitaba. If the mukatab pays what he\\n    owes of his kitaba, they take that in their bequests\\n    according to their shares. If the mukatab cannot pay, he\\n    is a slave of the people with bequests and does not\\n    return to the heirs because they gave him up when they\\n    made their choice, and because when he was surrendered to\\n    the people with bequests, they were liable. If he died,\\n    they would not have anything against the heirs. If the\\n    mukatab dies before he pays his kitaba and he leaves\\n    property which is more than what he owes, his property\\n    goes to the people with bequests. If the mukatab pays\\n    what he owes, he is free and his wala' returns to the\\n    paternal relations of the one who wrote the kitaba for\\n    him.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik spoke about a mukatab who owed his master ten\\n    thousand dirhams in his kitaba, and when he died he\\n    remitted one thousand dirhams from it. He said, \"The\\n    mukatab is valued and his value is taken into\\n    consideration. If his value is one thousand dirhams and\\n    the reduction is a tenth of the kitaba, that portion of\\n    the slave's price is one hundred dirhams. It is a tenth\\n    of the price. A tenth of the kitaba is therefore reduced\\n    for him. That is converted to a tenth of the price in\\n    cash. That is as if he had had all of what he owed\\n    reduced for him. Had he done that, only the value of the\\n    slave - one thousand dirhams - would have been taken into\\n    account in the third of the property of the deceased. If\\n    that which he had remitted is half of the kitaba, half\\n    the price is taken into account in the third of the\\n    property of the deceased. If it is more or less than\\n    that, it is according to this reckoning.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"When a man reduces the kitaba of his mukatab\\n    by one thousand dirhams at his death from a kitaba of ten\\n    thousand dirhams, and he does not stipulate whether it is\\n    from the beginning or the end of his kitaba, each\\n    instalment is reduced for him by one tenth.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"If a man remits one thousand dirhams from\\n    his mukatab at his death from the beginning or end of his\\n    kitaba, and the original basis of the kitaba is three\\n    thousand dirhams, the mukatab's cash value is estimated.\\n    Then that value is divided. That thousand which is from\\n    the beginning of the kitaba is converted into its portion\\n    of the price according to its proximity to the term and\\n    its precedence and then the thousand which follows the\\n    first thousand is according to its precedence also until\\n    it comes to its end, and every thousand is paid according\\n    to its place in advancing and deferring the term because\\n    what is deferred of that is less in respect of its price.\\n    Then it is placed in the third of the deceased according\\n    to whatever of the price befalls that thousand according\\n    to the difference in preference of that, whether it is\\n    more or less, then it is according to this reckoning.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik spoke about a man who willed a man a fourth of a\\n    mukatab or freed a fourth, and then the man died and the\\n    mukatab died and left a lot of property, more than he\\n    owed. He said, \"The heirs of the first master and the one\\n    who was willed a fourth of the mukatab are given what\\n    they are still owed by the mukatab. Then they divide what\\n    is left over, and the one willed a fourth has a third of\\n    what is left after the kitaba is paid. The heirs of his\\n    master gets two-thirds. That is because the mukatab is a\\n    slave as long as any of his kitaba remains to be paid. He\\n    is inherited from by the possession of his person.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said about a mukatab whose master freed him at\\n    death, \"If the third of the deceased will not cover him,\\n    he is freed from it according to what the third will\\n    cover and his kitaba is decreased according to that. If\\n    the mukatab owed five thousand dirhams and his value is\\n    two thousand dirhams cash, and the third of the deceased\\n    is one thousand dirhams, half of him is freed and half of\\n    the kitaba has been reduced for him.\" Malik said about a\\n    man who said in his will, \"My slave so-and-so is free and\\n    write a kitaba for so-and-so\", that the setting free had\\n    priority over the kitaba.\\n   </p>"

If there\\n    were a debt to people held against the master of the\\n    slave, as well as the criminal action of the slave, part\\n    of the mudabbar would be sold in proportion to the\\n    blood-money of the injury and according to the debt. Then\\n    one would begin with the blood-money which was for the\\n    criminal action of the slave and it would be paid from\\n    the price of the slave. Then the debt of his master would\\n    be paid, and then one would look at what remained after\\n    that of the slave. His third would b be set free, and\\n    two-thirds of him would belong to the heirs. That is\\n    because the criminal action of the slave is more\\n    important than the debt of his master. That is because,\\n    if the man dies and leaves a mudabbar slave whose value\\n    is one hundred and fifty dinars, and the slave strikes a\\n    free man on the head with a blow that lays open the\\n    skull, and the blood-money is fifty dinars, and the\\n    master of the slave has a debt of fifty dinars, one\\n    begins with the fifty dinars which are the blood-money of\\n    the head wound, and it is paid from the price of the\\n    slave. Then the debt of the master is paid. Then one\\n    looks at what remains of the slave, and a third of him is\\n    set free and two-thirds of him remain for the heirs. The\\n    blood-money is more pressing against his person than the\\n    debt of his master. The debt of his master is more\\n    pressing than the tadbir which is a bequest from the\\n    third of the property of the deceased. None of the tadbir\\n    is permitted while the master of the mudabbar has a debt\\n    which is not paid. It is a bequest. That is because\\n    Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, said, 'After any bequest\\n    that is made or any debt.' \" (Sura 4 ayat 10)\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"If there is enough in the third property\\n    that the deceased can bequeath to free all the mudabbar,\\n    he is freed and the blood-money due from his criminal\\n    action is held as a debt against him which follows him\\n    after he is set free even if that blood-money is the full\\n    blood-money. It is not a debt on the master.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik spoke about a mudabbar who injured a man and his\\n    master surrendered him to the injured party, and then the\\n    master died and had a debt and did not leave any property\\n    other than the mudabbar, and the heirs said, \"We\\n    surrender the mudabbar to the party,\" whilst the creditor\\n    said, \"My debt exceeds that.\" Malik said that if the\\n    creditor's debt did exceed that at all , he was more\\n    entitled to it and it was taken from the one who owed the\\n    debt, according to what the creditor was owed in excess\\n    of the blood-money of the injury. If his debt did not\\n    exceed it at all, he did not take the slave.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik spoke about a mudabbar who did an injury and had\\n    property, and his master refused to ransom him. He said,\\n    \"The injured party takes the property of the mudabbar for\\n    the blood-money of his injury. If there is enough to pay\\n    it, the injured party is paid in full for the blood-money\\n    of his injury and the mudabbar is returned to his master.\\n    If there is not enough to pay it, he takes it from the\\n    blood-money and uses the mudabbar for what remains of the\\n    blood-money.\"\\n   </p>"

He said, \"When one of them causes an\\n    injury below a third of the blood-money, it is taken on\\n    behalf of the child and woman from their personal\\n    property, if they have property from which it may be\\n    taken. If not, the injury which each of them has caused\\n    is a debt against them. The tribe does not have to pay\\n    any of it and the father of a child is not liable for the\\n    blood-money of an injury caused by the child and he is\\n    not responsible for it.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The way of doing things in our community\\n    about which there is no dispute, is that when a slave is\\n    killed, the value for him is that of the day on which he\\n    was killed. The tribe of the murderer is not liable for\\n    any of the value of the slave, great or small. That is\\n    the responsibility of the one who struck him from his own\\n    personal property as far as it covers. If the value of\\n    the slave is the blood-money or more, that is against him\\n    in his property. That is because the slave is a certain\\n    type of goods.\"\\n   </p>"

Muhayyisa, and his brother Huwayyisa and\\n    Abd ar-Rahman ibn Sahl went to the Prophet, may Allah\\n    bless him and grant him peace, and Abd ar-Rahman began to\\n    speak before his brother. The Messenger of Allah, may\\n    Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"The older\\n    first, the older first. \\n   </p><p>\\n    Therefore Huwayyisa and then Muhayyisa spoke and\\n    mentioned the affair of Abdullah ibn Sahl. The Messenger\\n    of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said\\n    to them, \"Do you swear with fifty oaths and claim the\\n    blood-money of your companion or the life of the\\n    murderer?\" They said, \"Messenger of Allah, we did not see\\n    it and we were not present.\" The Messenger of Allah, may\\n    Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Will you\\n    acquit the jews for fifty oaths?' They said, \"Messenger\\n    of Allah, how can we accept the oaths of a people who are\\n    kafirun?\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Yahya ibn Said said, \"Bushayr ibn Yasar claimed that the\\n    Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him\\n    peace, paid the blood-money from his own property.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The generally agreed on way of doing things\\n    in our community and that which I heard from whoever I am\\n    content with, concerning the oath of qasama, and upon\\n    which the past and present imams agree, is that those who\\n    claim revenge begin with the oaths and swear. The oath\\n    for revenge is only obligatory in two situations. Either\\n    the slain person says, 'My blood is against so-and-so,'\\n    or the relatives entitled to the blood bring a partial\\n    proof of it that is not irrefutable against the one who\\n    is the object of the blood-claim. This obliges taking an\\n    oath on the part of those who claim the blood against\\n    those who are the object of the blood-claim. With us,\\n    swearing is only obliged in these two situations.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"That is the sunna in which there is no\\n    dispute with us and which is still the behaviour of the\\n    people. The people who claim blood begin the swearings,\\n    whether it is an intentional killing or an accident.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him\\n    and grant him peace, began with Banu Harith in the case\\n    of the killing of their kinsman murdered at Khaybar.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"If those who make the claim swear, they\\n    deserve the blood of their kinsman and whoever they swear\\n    against is slain. Only one man can be killed in the\\n    qasama. Two cannot be killed in it. Fifty men from the\\n    blood-relatives must swear fifty oaths. If their number\\n    is less or some of them draw back, they can repeat their\\n    oaths, unless one of the relatives of the murdered man\\n    who deserves blood and who is permitted to pardon it,\\n    draws back. If one of these draws back, there is no way\\n    to revenge.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Yahya said that Malik said, \"The oaths can be made by\\n    those of them who remain if one of them draws back who is\\n    not permitted to pardon. If one of the blood-relatives\\n    draws back who is permitted to pardon, even if he is only\\n    one, more oaths can not be made after that by the\\n    blood-relatives. If that occurs, the oaths can be on\\n    behalf of the one against whom the claim is made. So\\n    fifty of the men of his people swear fifty oaths. If\\n    there are not fifty men, more oaths can be made by those\\n    of them who already swore. If there is only the\\n    defendant, he swears fifty oaths and is acquitted.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Yahya said that Malik said, \"One distinguishes between\\n    swearing for blood and oaths for one's rights. When a man\\n    has a money-claim against another man, he seeks to verify\\n    his due. When a man wants to kill another man, he does\\n    not kill him in the midst of people. He keeps to a place\\n    away from people. Had there only been swearing in cases\\n    where there is a clear proof and had one acted in it as\\n    one acts about one's rights (i.e. needing witnesses), the\\n    right of blood retribution would have been lost and\\n    people would have been swift to take advantage of it when\\n    they learned of the decision on it. However, the\\n    relatives of the murdered man were allowed to initiate\\n    swearing so that people might restrain themselves from\\n    blood and the murderer might beware lest he was put into\\n    a situation like that (i.e. qasama) by the statement of\\n    the murdered man.' \"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Yahya said, \"Malik said about a people of whom a certain\\n    number are suspected of murder and the relatives of the\\n    murdered man ask them to take oaths and they are\\n    numerous, so they ask that each man swears fifty oaths on\\n    his own behalf. The oaths are not divided out between\\n    them according to their number and they are not acquitted\\n    unless each man among them swears fifty oaths on his own\\n    behalf.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said, \"This is the best I have heard about the\\n    matter.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    He said, \"Swearing goes to the paternal relatives of the\\n    slain.

The life of the slave-girl for the life\\n    of the slave, and her injury for his injury. When a slave\\n    intentionally kills a slave, the master of the murdered\\n    slave has a choice. If he wishes, he kills him, and if he\\n    wishes, he takes the blood-money. If he takes the\\n    blood-money, he takes the value of his slave. If the\\n    owner of the slave who killed wishes to give the value of\\n    the murdered slave, he does it. If he wishes, he\\n    surrenders his slave. If he surrenders him, he is not\\n    obliged to do anything other than that. When the owner of\\n    the murdered slave takes the slave who murdered and is\\n    satisifed with him, he must not kill him. All\\n    retaliations between slaves for cutting off of the hand\\n    and foot and such things are dealt with in the same way\\n    as in the murder.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik said about a muslim slave who injures a jew or\\n    christian, \"If the master of the slave wishes to pay\\n    blood-money for him according to the injury, he does it.\\n    Or else he surrenders him and he is sold, and the jew or\\n    christian is given the blood-money of the injury or all\\n    the price of the slave if the blood-money is greater than\\n    his price.
