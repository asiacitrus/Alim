She said, 'It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdead' (i.e., it has not been slaughtered properly). He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid to her, 'Only eating it is forbidden.\"' This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated by the group. Ibn Majah attributes the incident\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Maimunah and her client. Al-Bukhari and an-Nasa'i do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot mention treating the skin. It is reported from Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abbas that he recited: \"Say (O Muhammad): \"In all that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been revealed to me, I do not find anything forbidden\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto eat; if one wants to eat thereof, unless it be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcarrion, or blood poured forth, or swine flesh...\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(al-An'am 145). Then he said, \"What is forbidden is its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeat. As for its skin, skin used for waterskins, teeth,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbones, fur and wool, they are permissible.\" This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnarrated by Ibn Mundhir and Ibn Hatim. Similarly, its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trennet and milk are considered pure. This is supported by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fact that when the companions conquered Iraq, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tate the cheese of the Magians which was made from rennet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talthough their slaughtered animals were considered the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame as 'dead animals.' It is confirmed from Salman\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Farsi that when he was asked about cheese, clarified\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbutter and pelts, he said, \"What is permissible is what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah made permissible in His book. What is forbidden is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat Allah made forbidden in His book. What he omits, He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas pardoned for you.\" It is well-known that he was being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked about the cheese of the Magians, as Salman was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Umar's deputy in Mada'in, Iraq.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

In Ibn alQayyim's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTahdhib as-Sunan, he relates from Ibn al-Mundhir, \"Ahmad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade a statement about the permissibility of wiping over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslippers because of his fairness and justice.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNevertheless, the basis of this permissibility is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice of the companions and a manifest analogy. There\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis no real difference between socks and slippers. It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorrect that they take the same ruling. Most scholars say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat one can wipe over either one.\" Those who permit it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinclude Sufyan al-Thauri, Ibn al-Mubarak, 'Ata, al-Hasan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Sa'eed ibn alMusayyab. Commenting on this subject,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Yusuf and Muhammad said, \"It is allowed to wipe over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem if they are thick and completely hide what they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcover.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Hanifah did not approve of wiping over thick\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslippers, but he changed his mind three or seven days\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore his death. He wiped over his slippers during his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tillness and said to his visitors, \"I did what I used to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttell people not to do.\" Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah reported\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tablution and wiped over his socks and slippers. This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated by Ahmad, at-Tahawi, Ibn Majah and at-Tirmidhi,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho called it hassan sahih. Abu Dawud graded it weak.2\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs it is permissible to wipe over socks so is it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermissible to wipe over any foot covering, which has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen used to avoid the cold or protect the wound, and so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton. Of its permissibility, Ibn Taimiyyah says, \"It is all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright to wipe over foot covering because it takes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprecedence over wiping socks or slippers, for usually a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfoot covering is used for some need and to protect the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfeet from some harm. If wiping over the socks and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslippers is allowed, then wiping over any foot covering\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould come first. Whoever claims that there is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsensus on the inadmissibility of wiping over foot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcoverings does so with a lack of knowledge. Not to speak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof a consensus, he cannot prove its forbiddance even from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe works of ten famous scholars.\" He goes on to say,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Whoever ponders over the words of the Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, upon whom be peace, and gives analogy its proper\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplace, will know that the license from him was spacious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton this subject and in accord with the beauty of Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlaw and the monotheistic magnanimity with which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet had been sent.\" Even if there are some holes or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcuts in the socks, it is permissible to wipe over them,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas long as the person has only such socks to wear. Says\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Thauri, \"The slippers of the emigrants and helpers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere not free of cuts or holes, like the slippers of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople (in general).

In fact, Islamic law even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoes to the extent of ordering one to perform ghusl at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis time as part of the overall cleanliness and hygiene\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Muslim society.

This understanding of the Prophet's saying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis derived from what al-Bukhari recorded about an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident from Ibn 'Umar about his father. One day, 'Umar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tibn al-Khattab was standing and delivering the khutbah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen 'Uthman, one of the people from among the emigrants\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand helpers, entered.

This illustrates\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the companions knew that this order was one of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchoice. It also shows that it is preferred.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim recorded that Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying, \"Whoever makes the ablution and perfects it and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen goes to the Friday prayer and listens attentively,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill have forgiveness during (the period) between the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFriday and the next (Friday), and an additional three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays.\" Says al-Qurtubi, \"This hadith shows that ghusl is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreferred. The mention of ablution, the reward and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacceptability points to the fact that ablution alone is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsufficient.'' Ibn Hajr states in at-Talkhis, \"It is one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the strongest proofs that ghusl for the Friday prayer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis not obligatory. The statement that it is preferred is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbuilt upon the fact that if one does not perform ghusl,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit will not harm (his prayer). But, if others are harmed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby his perspiration or bad smell from his clothes and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbody, ghusl becomes obligatory, and not performing it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetracts from the rewards of salah. Some scholars say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Friday ghusl is a duty even if its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnon-performance causes no harm (to others). Their basis\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor this opinion is the hadith related by Abu Hurairah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich the Prophet, upon whom be peace, said, \"It is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduty upon every Muslim to perform ghusl once every seven\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays, by washing his head and body.\" Al-Bukhari and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim accept the hadith mentioned on the subject in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir apparent meanings, and refute the ones contrary to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe last hadith (of Abu Hurairah).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe time for the Friday ghusl is between dawn and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime of the Friday prayer. It is preferable to do it at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe time of departure (to the mosque). If one loses his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tablution after that, it is sufficient for him just to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake a new ablution (he does not have to repeat the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tghusl).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSays al-Athram, \"I heard Ahmad being asked if a person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformed ghusl, and then lost it, would the regular\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tablution be sufficient for him. He said, 'Yes, and I have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot heard anything about that preferable to the hadith of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn 'Abzi,\" Ahmad is referring to the hadith related by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn 'Abzi Shaibah (with a sahih chain from 'Abdurahman\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tibn 'Abzi on the authority of his father, who was a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanion.)He performed ghusl for the Friday prayer, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafterwards nullified his ablution. After that, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformed just the regular ablution, and did not repeat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this ghusl. The time for the ghusl ends with the time of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe prayer. If one performs ghusl after the prayer, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould not be the ghusl of the Friday prayer, and one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes so is not following the Prophet's order.

    "text": "<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe prayer is a type of worship consisting of specific\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatements and actions. It is begun by pronouncing the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreatness of Allah, and is concluded with salutations of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace. As prayer is the essence of Islam, we will discuss\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit here in detail.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTo state it simply, prayer must exist, for without it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam can not stand. The Prophet, upon whom be peace,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"The head of the matter is Islam, its pillar is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayer, and the top of its hump is jihad in the way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah.\" It was the first act of worship that was made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligatory by Allah. Its obligation was revealed directly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Prophet, during his ascension to heaven. Said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnas, \"The prayers were made obligatory on the Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon whom be peace, the night of his ascension to heaven.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt first, they were fifty in number, but were reduced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseveral times until they were five. Then it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproclaimed, 'O Muhammad, the order is not changed. These\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfive are (equivalent) to the fifty.''\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs to the authenticity of the report, it is related by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad, an-Nasa'i and at-Tirmidhi, who said it is sahih.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSalah is the first act that the person will be held\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccountable for. 'Abdullah ibn Qart related that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, said \"The first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tact that the slave will be accountable for on the Day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJudgement will be prayer. If it is good, then the rest of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this acts will be good. And if it is evil, then the rest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his acts will be evil.\" (Related by at-Tabarani.) It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the last thing that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecommended to his nation before he died, saying,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Prayer, prayer and what your right hand possesses.\" It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill be the last thing taken away from the religion. When\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit perishes, Islam will perish. The Messenger of Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon whom be peace, said, \"If Islam were stripped away,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpiece by piece, people would hold tight to the next one.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe first thing taken would be ruling and governance, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe last thing would be prayer.\" (Related by Ibn Hibban\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the hadith of Abu Umamah.) In many verses of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an, Allah follows up prayer with the remembrance of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah. \"Lo! Worship preserves (one) from lewdness and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tiniquity, but verily, remembrance of Allah is more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant.\" (al-'Ankabut 45); \"He is successful who grows\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand remembers the name of his Lord, so pray (al-A'la\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t14-15); \"So serve Me and establish worship for My\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremembrance\" (Taha 74). Sometimes He mentions prayer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talong with zakah: \"Establish prayer and pay zakah\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(al-Baqarah 110). And at times, with patience: \"Seek help\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin patience and prayer\" (al-Baqarah 45), and with hajj:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"So pray unto your Lord and sacrifice\" (al-Kauthar 2);\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Say: Lo! my worship and my sacrifice and my living and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmy dying are for Allah, Lord of the Worlds. He has no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpartner. This am I commanded, and I am the first of those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho surrender (unto Him)\" (al-An'am 162-163). At other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttimes, Allah begins the acts of piety with prayers and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tends with them, as in the verses about the ma'arij\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(ascension to heaven): \"Successful indeed are the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers who are humble in their prayers,\" and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverses, \"And who pay heed to their prayers.

There will they abide\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(al-Mu'minun 1-29-11).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe importance of salah is so great that one is ordered\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto observe it while travelling or not, while one is safe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor in fear: \"Be guardians of your prayers, and of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmid-most prayer, and stand up with devotion to Allah. And\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif you go in fear, then (pray) standing or on horseback.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen you are safe, remember Allah, as He has taught you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat which (heretofore) you knew not\" (al-Baqarah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t238-239).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

Among the non-companions who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshared this view were Ibn Hanbal, Ishaq ibn Rahwaih,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak, an-Nakha'i, al-Hakim ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Utaibah, Abu Ayyub as-Sakhtiyani, Abu Dawud at-Tayalisi,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Bakr ibn Abu Shaibah, Zuhair ibn Harb, and others.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSome hadith make it clear that such a person should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkilled.

Another narration states,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"If anyone leaves one of them, by Allah he becomes an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunbeliever and no voluntary deeds or recompense will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccepted from him, and his blood and wealth become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlawful.\" This is a clear indication that such a person is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto be killed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn 'Umar related that the Messenger of Allah, upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace, said, \"I have been ordered to kill the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuntil they testify that there is no god except Allah, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablish prayer and pay the zakah. If they do that,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir blood and wealth are protected from me save by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trights of Islam. Their reckoning will be with Allah.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Related by al-Bukhari and Muslim.)\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUmm Salamah related that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"There will be rulers over you who will do good and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevil things. Whoever hates these (latter) acts will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinnocent of them. Whoever denies them will be safe, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(not) one who accepts and follows them.\" They asked,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Should we kill them?\" He said, \"Not if they pray.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Related by Muslim.) Therefore, he made it unlawful to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkill even an unjust ruler who observes his prayers.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Sa'eed reported that 'Ali, while he was in Yemen,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsent the Prophet some gold, which he then divided among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfour people. A man said, \"O Messenger of Allah, beware of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah.\" The Prophet said, \"Woe to you. Of all the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the earth, am I not the most dutiful in being aware of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah?\" Khalid ibn al-Walid said, \"O Messenger of Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshall I kill him?\" He said, \"Perhaps he is one of those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho pray.\" Khalid said, \"How many people say with their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttongues what is not in their hearts?\" The Prophet said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"I have not been ordered to look into the hearts of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople, nor to rip open their bellies.\" (Abridged from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Bukhari and Muslim.) In this hadith also, prayer is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven as the reason for not killing a person. It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstood, therefore, that not praying would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresulted in the person's killing.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEven though the preceding hadith clearly rule that one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho discards salah becomes an unbeliever and should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkilled, many early and later scholars (excluding Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHanifah, Malik and ash-Shafi) believe that such people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome evildoers who must repent. If such a person does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot repent, he is to be killed, that being the prescribed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunishment, according to Malik, ash-Shai'i and others.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Hanifah maintains that such a person is not to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkilled, but must be given a minor punishment and confined\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuntil he prays. They say the hadith that calls such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople unbelievers refer to those who deny the prayers,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand so on. They say that any other interpretation is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontradicted by other texts. For example, Allah says,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Lo! Allah does not pardon one who gives Him partners. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpardons all save whom He wills\" (an-Nisa' 116). There is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso a hadith related by Abu Hurairah and recorded by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad and Muslim in which the Prophet, upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace, said, \"Every prophet has a special supplication\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat is answered. Every prophet hastened to make his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupplication, but I concealed mine and will use it for my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnation on the Day of Resurrection. It will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgranted--Allah willing--to whoever dies without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassociating any partners with Allah.\" Al-Bukhari also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecorded that Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon whom be peace, said, \"The person who will be the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappiest due to my intercession is the one who says,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'There is no god but Allah' sincerely from his heart.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSays ash-Shaukani, \"The truth of the matter is that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecomes an unbeliever who is to be killed for his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunbelief. The hadith authenticates that Islamic law calls\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone who does not pray an unbeliever. It has also put the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformance as the barrier between a believer and an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunbeliever. Abandoning prayer means he may be called an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunbeliever. We need not concern ourselves with arguments\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresented by those of the opposing opinion. We can say to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem: It is not impossible that some types of unbelievers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmay obtain forgiveness or may have a right to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercession, such as the unbelief of those who pray to (\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tour) qiblah. Nevertheless, the fact remains that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommit some sins which the Islamic law views as unbelief.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTo turn to the other narrow interpretations is just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tredundant.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

Says\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Urwa, \"If you reach a mosque wherein the people have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talready prayed, you may base your prayer on their adhan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand iqamah, as theirs are sufficient for those who come\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter them.\" This was the opinion of al-Hassan,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tash-Sha'bi and an-Nakha'i. Al-Hassan, however, said, \"I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprefer that he makes the iqamah. If he makes the adhan,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the should do so in a low voice and not aloud, for some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople may consider it out of place.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

He performed his prayer in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same manner that he asked others to pray--'light' or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'easy'. If his prayers were somewhat long, they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstill easy compared to how long he could have made them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe guidance that he came with and practiced is the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat decides our affairs and disputes for us.

In another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith, 'Aishah reports that the Prophet sallallahu alehi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twasallam would perform nine rak'at during the night and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he would not sit during them until the eighth rak'ah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin which he would make remembrance of Allah, praising\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHim, and would make supplication. Then, he would stand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout making the taslim and pray the ninth rak'ah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter which he would sit, make the tashahud and make the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaslim in such a manner that we could hear him. Then, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould pray two rak'at after the taslim while sitting, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat would make eleven rak'at. When he became older and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theavier, he would make the witr with seven rak'at,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperforming the (last) two rak'at like the first one. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother version from her, it is stated: \"When he became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tolder and bulkier, he would make the witr with seven\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trak'at, and he would not sit during them, save in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsixth and seventh rak'ah and he would not make the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaslim, save in the seventh rak'ah.\" In yet another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tversion, it is stated: \"He would pray seven rak'at and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould not sit, save in the last of them.\" This is related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the group.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAll of the preceding ahadith are authentic and clear and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is no contradiction in them. As to the Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatement: \"The night prayer is in sets of two [rak'at],\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is not relevant here. This is an authentic hadith, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe statement that he observed witr with seven or five\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trak'at is equally true. Both statements confirm each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother. The seven, five, nine, and one rak'ah constitute\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe witr prayer, for witr is the name given to the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trak'ah offered in conclusion of whatever is offered prior\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto it. And the witr of the five, seven and nine rak'at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare all connected like the maghrib which is described as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree connected rak'at. If one breaks apart the five or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseven rak'at with two taslim, like in the eleven rak'at,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit will all be called witr due to the last odd rak'ah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is supported by the Prophet's statement: 'The night\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayer is sets of two rak'at. If one fears the coming of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe dawn, he should perform one rak'ah, thereby making\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall of them odd [witr].' Therefore, the Prophet's actions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand statements are in agreement, each part confirming the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother.\" The fact is that the Prophet was responding to a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestion about the night prayer when he said: \"it is in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpairs of two.\" He was not speaking about witr, for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman had asked him about night prayer, and not about the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twitr.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSireen narrates that Anas ibn Malik was asked: \"Did the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet make the qunut in the dawn prayer?\" He answered:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Yes.\" They asked him: \"Before the ruku' or after it?\" He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied: \"After it.\" This is related by the group save\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat-Tirmidhi.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere is a report from Anas which says: \"The Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah sallallahu alehi wasallam did not stop making qunut\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduring the dawn prayer until he left this world.\" This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated by Ahmad, al-Bazzar, adDaraqutni, al-Baihaqi, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Hakim who says it is sahih.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, there remains some doubt concerning this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevidence since the qunut which they asked Anas about, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis clear in the narrations of al Bukhari and Muslim, was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe qunut during the time of calamities.

How could it be that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Messenger of Allah never stopped performing this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqunut until his death, and yet, the rightly guided\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaliphs did not perform it? It is even confirmed that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnas himself did not make the qunut in the dawn prayer!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf we must accept this latter hadith as authentic, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould mean that the Prophet always made supplications and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremembrance ( dhikr), after the ruku', until his death.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis would also come under qunut and, in this sense, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be more befitting.

The companions of Malik say that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermissibility is only for voluntary prayers and not for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligatory prayers. This interpretation is incorrect as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is clear that the Prophet was leading one of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligatory prayers, and as stated earlier it was the fajr\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayer. Some followers of Malik claim that its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermissibility has been abograted, while others say it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas only permissible for the Prophet, and yet others hold\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it was due to some necessity. All of this is wrong\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand to be rejected as there is no proof for any of it or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany necessity. The authentic hadith clearly states that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is permissible and there is nothing in that ruling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich contradicts any basic principle of the shari'ah as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta human being is pure and what is in his/her abdomen is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot relevant in this regard, as it remains within the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstomach, its natural receptacle. Also, the clothing of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchild is considered pure and the shari'ah is quite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplicit on this point. Actions during the salah do not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvalidate it if they are minor or few or dispersed. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfact that the Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam did this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis an exposition of its permissibility, and this argument\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis built upon the principle which we have mentioned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore. This refutes what Abu Sulaiman al-Khattabi says,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnamely, that the Prophet did not carry the child\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintentionally but the child was holding onto the Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand when he stood the child remained with him. He said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Do not think that he held him again intentionally as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat would be too much action and would distract the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theart. If a curtain distracted him, how could [the child]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot distract him?\" This statement by al-Khattabi, may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah have mercy on him, is incorrect and to be rejected.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmong the things that refute it are the statements in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSahih Muslim, \"when he stood, he carried him.\" And, \"when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the got up from his sajdah, he would return [the child to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this place].\" Further refutations are derived from a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tversion other than Sahih Muslim, \"He came to us while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcarrying Umamah and prayed...\" Concerning the ruling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout the curtain, it distracts the heart without there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing any benefit to it. Concerning carrying Umamah, we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare not convinced that it distracts the heart, and even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif it does, it is allowed due to its benefit and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprinciples that we have mentioned. The source of that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreoccupation is that benefit, which differs from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident concerning the curtain. Thus, the correct\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tposition is that the hadith is a clear exposition that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis permissible to carry a child in salah and this will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue to be part of the Islamic law until the Day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJudgment. And Allah knows best.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrites:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Prophet would pray and 'Aishah would be lying between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim and the qiblah. When he performed sajdah, he would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsignal to her with his hand and she would pull back her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleg and when he would stand she would stretch out her leg\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagain. The Prophet was praying and the Satan came to him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto disturb his salah and the Prophet choked until his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaliva came upon his hand. And the Prophet would pray\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon the pulpit, making ruku' there, but when the time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame to perform sajdah, he would descend, moving\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbackward, and prostrate upon the ground, and then return\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the pulpit. He once prayed toward a wall and an animal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttried to pass between him and the wall. The Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevented the animal from passing to the extent that its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstomach was against the wall. Once while he was praying,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo girls from the tribe of 'Abd al-Muttalib were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfighting behind him and he separated them with his arms\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhile he was praying. Ahmad's version says that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrabbed unto his knees and he separated them without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleaving the salah. On another occasion, when he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpraying, a boy came to him and he motioned to him to move\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tback, and he moved back. Then a girl tried to pass in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfront of him, he beckoned her to move back, but the girl\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassed, and when he finished, he said: \"They are more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetermined.\" Ahmad recorded it and it is also in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSunan. He would also puff out air while praying. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith which states: \" Puffing out is speech\" cannot be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraced to the Messenger of Allah, but Sa'id related it in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Sunan from Ibn 'Abbas as one of Ibn 'Abbas'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatements - if it is authentic. The Prophet would cry\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduring his salah and would also clear his throat while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpraying. 'Ali ibn Abi Talib said: \"I had a certain time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat which I would visit the Messenger of Allah. When I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame to him, he would permit me to enter. If I found him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpraying, he would clear his throat and I would enter. If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the was free, he would give me permission to enter.\" This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis recorded by an-Nasa'i and Ahmad. Ahmad's version says:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"I could enter upon the Prophet during the day or night.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf I came to him while he was praying, he would clear his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthroat [as a sign that I may enter]. This was related by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad who used to act by it and he was not of the opinion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat clearing one's throat invalidated the salah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSometimes the Prophet would pray barefoot and sometimes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhile wearing shoes. This is what 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid and he ordered people to pray with shoes on in order\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto differ from the Jews. Sometimes he would pray in one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgarment and sometimes in two garments and [this latter]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas the majority of the cases.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

Abu Hanifah, Malik, and ash-Shaf'i say that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the can make up the prayer after its time has expired, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik and Abu Hanifa even say that if a person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintentionally misses a prayer or a few prayers, then he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis to make up those prayers before he prays the present\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsalah, even if he has missed all five prayers and should,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhile making them up, miss the present salah.

The proof for our\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tposition [i.e, the position of Ibn Hazm] is found in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords of Allah, the Exalted: \"Woe unto the worshippers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho are heedless of their prayers,'' and: \"And then there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsucceeded them a later generation who wasted the prayers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand followed their own lusts, but they will meet with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestruction.\" If one who intentionally misses a salah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould make it up later, then why is it mentioned with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffliction or transgression?

This is not to draw an analogy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween one and the other but it is applying the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trule to them as they both must be performed within the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlimits set by Allah.

If they say obedient, they will be differing from the consensus of the Muslims and the Qur'an and the confirmed sunnah. If they say he is being disobedient, they are speaking the truth and it is not valid that an act of disobedience should replace an act of obedience. Also, Allah, the Exalted, has set specific limits, through the tongue of His Messenger, for the times of the salah.

No one of this ummah will dispute that point. However, if one is allowed to pray after the time set by the Messenger of Allah, then setting an ending time for the salah has no meaning to it. Such an opinion is nonsense and may Allah, the Exalted, keep us from it.

In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfact, such a person has been ordered to pray sitting, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the cannot pray standing, and if he cannot pray sitting,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen he may pray on his side. Also, if one cannot make\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tablution with water, he may make tayammum; and if he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot find soil to make tayammum, he may still pray.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhence has the permission been obtained that one may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintentionally leave the salah until its time is finished\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand who has ordered that it be performed after its time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand how is it that the belated salah would be sufficient?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNone of this is derived from the Qur'an, Sunnah, Qiyas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(analogical reasoning), and so forth.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Hazm further says: \"Concerning our statement that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone who intentionally leaves a salah until its time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpires is to repent to Allah, the Exalted, ask for His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforgiveness, pray an increased number of nawafil, and do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgood deeds. This statement is based on Allah's words:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Then there succeeded them a generation who missed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayers and followed after lusts. But they will meet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestruction save him who repents and believes and does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright. Such will enter the garden and will not be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twronged,\" and: \"...those who, when they do an evil thing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor wrong themselves, remember Allah and implore\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforgiveness for their sins - who forgives sins, save\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah - and will not knowingly repeat the wrong they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid,\" and: \"Whoever does an atom's weight of good shall\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsee it and whoever does an atom's weight of evil shall\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsee it,\" and: \"...We set a just balance for the day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresurrection so no soul shall be wronged.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis [Muslim] ummah is in agreement, and there are texts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat state that voluntary acts are a type of good deeds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Allah knows how much they are really worth. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessarily follows that a number of voluntary works may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe equivalent in merit to an obligatory deed and may even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamount to a greater merit.

    "text": "<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe conclusion from the Qur'anic verse is that any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraveling, be it long or short, which falls within the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlinguistic definition of the word \"travel\" would suffice\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto shorten one's salah, to combine them and to break the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfast. There is nothing in the sunnah which confines this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeneral term to any particular meaning. Ibn al-Mundhir\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand others have mentioned more than twenty reports on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis point. Here we shall mention some of the more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant reports.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad, Muslim, Abu Dawud, and al-Baihaqi record that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYahya ibn Yazid said: \"I asked Anas ibn Malik about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshortening the prayer, and he said: 'The Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah would pray two rak'at if he had traveled a distance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof three miles or farsakh.\"' Ibn Hajar writes in Fath\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Bari: \"This is the most authentic hadith which states\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand clarifies [that question].\" The conflict between mile\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand farsakh is made clear in Abu Sa'id al-Khudri's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatement: \"If the Prophet traveled a distance of one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfarsakh, he would shorten his prayer.\" This was related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Sa'id ibn Mansur in his Sunan and by al-Hafiz ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajar in at-Talkhis, and he implicitly accepted it by not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaking any further comments about it. It is well-known\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat a farsakh equals three miles and, therefore, Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSa'id's hadith removes the confusion which arises from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnas' hadith when he says that the shortest distance, due\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto which the Prophet shortened his prayer, was three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmiles. One farsakh is equivalent to 5,541 meters while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone mile equals 1,748 meters. The shortest distance which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been mentioned with respect to the shortening of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsalah is one mile. This was recorded by Ibn abi Shaibah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith a sahih chain, on the authority of Ibn 'Umar. Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHazm follows this report, and argues that if the distance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis less than one mile, one is not to shorten the salah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Messenger of Allah went to the graveyard of al-Baqi'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto bury the dead and (similarly) he went off to answer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe call of nature and did not shorten his salah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConcerning what some jurists say, namely, that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjourney must be at least two days long or as some say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree days, Imam Abu al-Qasim alKharqi's refutation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir opinion is sufficient for us. In al-Mughni he says:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 'I do not find any proof for what those scholars say.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe statements of the (sahabah) companions are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontradictory, and they are not a (conclusive) proof if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey differ. Something has been related from Ibn 'Umar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Ibn 'Abbas which differs from what these scholars use\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas proof. Even if that were not the case, their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatements do not constitute a proof when a statement or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taction of the Prophet himself exists. Even if their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatements were accepted, we would not be able to follow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe distance they mentioned due to the following two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treasons. One, they differ from the sunnah that has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated from the Prophet and from the clear meaning of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qur'an, as the clear meaning of the verse allows one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto shorten one's salah if one makes any journey upon the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearth. Allah says: \"If you journey on the earth, there is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno blame upon you if you shorten your prayer.\" The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition of there being fear has been deleted as can be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseen in the hadith we recorded from Ya'la ibn Umayyah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand what remains is the clear meaning of the verse which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcovers every type of journey. The Prophet said: \"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraveler may wipe over his socks for a period of three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays.\" This shows the length of time that one may wipe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover the socks and it cannot be used as a proof for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestion we are discussing here. One could argue that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraveling is less than a three-day journey on the basis\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the hadith: \"It is not allowed for any woman who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieves in Allah and the last day to travel a journey of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone day, save in the presence of a male relative.\" Two,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe question of the distance to be traveled is one that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmay only be answered by some sort of revelation from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, the Exalted [the Qur' an or Sunnah]; it is not the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttype of issue which one may address on the basis of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonal reasoning, nor is there any way to derive an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanalogy. The proofs which exist support the opinion that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshortening the salah is permissible for every traveler,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunless there is some consensus to the contrary.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSimilar to that is the traveling by planes, trains, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso forth, or a trip that is in obedience to Allah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tExalted, or otherwise. If there is someone whose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccupation requires him to always be traveling, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance, a pilot, a ship captain, truck driver, and so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton, then he is permitted to shorten his salah or break\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this fast as he is truly traveling.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

If the person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintends to stay in a place for a certain amount of time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen, according to Ibn al-Qayyim, he remains a traveler,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregardless of whether he plans to stay there for a long\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor short time, as long as he does not plan to stay [i.e.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treside and not return] in the place that he has traveled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto. The scholars differ on this point. Summing up and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiving his own opinion, Ibn al-Qayyim says: \"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah stayed in Tabuk for twenty days and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduring that time he shortened his salah and he did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay that one may not shorten his salah if he stays longer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan that, although there is agreement that he did stay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere for that period of time.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Sahih al-Bukhari, it is recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Prophet stayed, during some of his journeys, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnineteen day and he prayed only two rak'at. If we stayed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin a place for nineteen days, we would not pray the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplete salah. However, if we stayed longer than that,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twe would perform the whole salah.\" Ahmad states that ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abbas was referring to the Prophet's stay in Makkah at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe time of its conquest when he said: \"The Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah stayed in Makkah for eighteen days during the time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the conquest as he had to go to Hunain and was not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplanning to stay there.\" This is his interpretation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn 'Abbas' statement. Others say that Ibn 'Abbas was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treferring to the Prophet's stay in Tabuk as Jabir ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abdullah said: \"The Messenger of Allah stayed in Tabuk\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor twenty days and performed qasr salah.\" Imam Ahmad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated this in his Musnad. Al-Miswar ibn Makhramah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treports: \"We stayed with Sa'd in some of the cities of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tash-Sham [Syria] for forty days, and Sa'd would perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqasr while we would offer the whole salah.\" Naf'i\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelates: \"Ibn 'Umar was in Azerbaijan for six months, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere was snow blocking the pass, and he would pray two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trak'at.\" Hafs ibn 'Ubaidullah says: \"Anas ibn Malik\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstayed in ash-Sham for two years and he prayed the salah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof a traveler.\" Anas relates: \"The companions of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet stayed in Ram Hurmuz for seven months and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshortened their salah.\" Al-Hassan reports: \"I stayed with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abdurrahman ibn Samurah for two years in Kabul, and he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshortened his salah but he did not combine the salah.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbrahim says: \"We resided in Rai for a year or more and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Sijistan for two years . . . [and we prayed qasr].\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is the guidance of the Prophet and his companions,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand this is the correct position.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConcerning other opinions which people follow Imam Ahmad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay: \"If a person intends to stay for four days, he has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto offer the whole salah and he may offer qasr if his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintention is for less than that. This is based on an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretation of the reports from the Prophet and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanions [i.e., they never intended to stay for longer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan that and would always say: 'We will leave tomorrow,'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand so on]. This interpretation is obviously suspect. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet conquered Makkah and stayed there to establish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam, eradicate polytheism, and to guide the Arabs. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefinitely goes, without saying, that such an objective\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes take more than a day or two to complete. Similarly,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this stay in Tabuk was in preparation for the impending\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twar and he knew that this might take longer than just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfour days. In the same way, Ibn 'Umar's stay in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAzerbaijan for six months, and his praying qasr during\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe entire time was with the knowledge that it takes more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan two or three days for such snow to melt and the pass\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto become traversable. The same is the case with Anas'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstay of two years in ash-Sham and his praying qasr and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe companions' stay in Ram Hurmuz for seven months while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshortening their prayers. It is well known that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactivities like theirs, such as jihad and guarding, took\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore than four days.\" The followers of Ahmad maintain:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"If one is staying in a place for the purpose of jihad or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdue to imprisonment or sickness, then one may shorten\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone's salah regardless of whether the person thinks that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch a situation may last for a short time or a long\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime.\" This is correct but there is no proof that such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions have been stipulated in the Qur'an, Sunnah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tijma' (consensus), or practice of the Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanions. They argued that such conditions are based on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat is needed for the person to fulfill his need while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremaining a traveler, and that is what is less than four\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays. His response to them was: 'From where do you derive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose conditions, while the Prophet sallallahu alehi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twasallam stayed for more than four days, shortening his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsalah, in Makkah and Tabuk, and he did not mention to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanyone anything about it and he never told them that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnever intended to stay for more than four days, even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthough he knew that the people would [strictly] follow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this actions concerning the salah. They surely followed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim in his shortening of the salah, and he did not object\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto their praying qasr if they were to stay for more than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfour nights. This should be made clear as it is very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant. Similarly, the companions (as-sahabah)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowed him in that and he did not say anything [in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobjection] to those who prayed with him.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik and ash-Shaf'i say: \"If one intends to stay for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore than four days, he should perform the whole salah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand if he intends to stay for less than that, he is to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffer qasr.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Hanifah holds: \"If one intends to stay for fifteen\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays, he should do the qasr. If he intends to stay for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tless than that, he should not shorten the salah.\" This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso the opinion of al-Laith ibn Sa'd, and it has also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen related from three companions: 'Umar, ibn 'Umar, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn 'Abbas.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSa'id ibn al-Musayyab is of the opinion that: \"If you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstay for four days, you pray four rak'at.\" A statement\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimilar to that of Abu Hanifah's has also been related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom him. 'Ali ibn Abi Talib says that if one stays for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tten days, he is to perform the whole salah, and the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been related from Ibn ' Abbas .\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Hassan says: \"One who does not get to his destination\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor (city of residence) may shorten salah.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Aishah says: \"One who does not put down his provision is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto shorten the salah.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe four imams agree that if one has some need to take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcare of and always has the intention of leaving the next\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tday, then he may shorten his salah for as long as he is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin that state. However, according to one statement of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tash-Shaf'i, he may do so only for seventeen or eighteen\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays and he is not to shorten his salah after that time.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn al-Mundhir states in his Ishraf: \"The people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknowledge are in agreement that a traveler may perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqasr as long as he does not intend to stay in a place,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven though he stays there for years.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

It was also mentioned that a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcongregation is a condition for the Friday salah. This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat the sunnah of the Prophet teaches us and what Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tholds us responsible for. Concerning the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstipulations which some of the jurists stipulate for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJumu'ah salah, none of them has any basis to which we may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefer, or any evidence to support it. It will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsufficient here to simply quote the author of ar-Raudah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanNadiyah who writes:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[The Friday salah] is like the rest of the prayers and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is nothing in it that differs from them, unless\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is some evidence to the contrary. This statement\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefutes those who stipulate, as a necessary conditions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor Friday prayer, the presence of a well-established\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timam and a congregational mosque in the area as well as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcertain number of people attending the congregational\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayer. There is no evidence whatever that those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions are even preferred - not to speak of being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligatory, or for that matter, being a necessary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition for the Friday salah. If two people pray the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJumu'ah in a place where there is no one else but them,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey would have performed their prescribed duty. If one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof them delivers the khutbah, they would be following\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat is sunnah; and if they leave the khutbah, then it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly the sunnah which they have neglected, (not something\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich was obligatory). But for the hadith of Tariq ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tShihab which clearly requires every Muslim to offer it in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcongregation and the fact that the Prophet sallallahu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talehi wasallam always performed it in a congregation,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffering it individually, like the rest of the prayers,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould have been quite acceptable. Concerning the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatement \"from four people to the ruler of the area,\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat is certainly not the Prophet's statement nor of any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his companions... In fact, [this is] a statement of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Hassan al-Basri. As to various statements and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpsuedojuristic opinions concerning this noble worship,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Friday prayer, which Allah has prescribed once a week\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas one of the signs of Islam, a little consideration\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould suffice to show their superfluity and error. One\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof these is the amazing statement that khutbah is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tequivalent to two rak'at of salah, and if one misses it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen his jumu'ah is not valid. They seem to be quite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tignorant of what has been related from the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough a number of chains which support each other that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"if a person misses one rak'ah, then he is to perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother rak'ah and his salah would be completed.\" Have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot other ahadith reached them that are valid in such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatters? Some say that one cannot perform the Jumu'ah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunless there are three people with the imam and others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thold that four people are needed, while yet others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstipulate seven people! Still others say nine, and some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthink twelve, twenty, thirty, and there are even some who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthink forty, fifty, seventy, and every number that is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween those numbers! Some hold that many people have to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe present without specifying a particular number, while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers state that al-Jumu'ah may only be performed in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcity in which there is a \"congregational mosque.\" Some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare convinced that there have to be so many thousand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople living in the area. Some hold that there has to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta congregational mosque and a public restroom. Yet others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpropose that the prayer is not obligatory unless there is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta well-known and established imam; if such an imam cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe found or if his credibility is doubtful, then the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFriday salah is neither obligatory nor legitimate....No\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch statement can be found [in the book of Allah or in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sunnah] to support what they claim to be the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions or prerequisites of the Jumu'ah... Whoever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomes with such gibberish must be refuted for the only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcriterion is the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger. As Allah says in the Qur'an: \"If you dispute\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerning any matter, refer it to Allah and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger\"; \"The answer of the believers, when summoned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Allah and His Messenger, in order that he may judge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween them is no other than this: they say: \"We hear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand we obey\"; \"But no, by thy Lord, they can have no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(real) faith, until they make thee judge in all disputes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween them, and find in their souls no resistance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconviction.\" Those verses and others similar to them are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe clearest evidence that one must return to the rule of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah and His Messenger if there is any dispute. The rule\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah is the Book of Allah. The rule of the Messenger,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter his passing away, is his sunnah and nothing other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan that. Also, Allah did not endow any of his slaves -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven if he reaches the highest degree of knowledge and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas accumulated what no one else has - with the right to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake any statement concerning this religion without any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority from the Book or the Sunnah. Likewise, if a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmujtahid (jurisconsult) should take liberty of proposing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan opinion without substantiating it, then it is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermissible for anyone to follow him in that, regardless\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof who he may be. I, as Allah knows, am always greatly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tastonished by this type of writers and their writings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich supposedly provide guidance in one's creed and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice but which are filled with gibberish. This is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlimited to only some of the schools among the different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tschools of law, or only certain areas from among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifferent areas, or only certain eras from among all of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe eras [it is found in all of these schools of law,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tareas, and eras]!

This is the spirit of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taddress which the Islamic law has instituted. As to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother contents of the khutbah, like praising Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying prayers upon His Messengers or reciting a portion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Qur'an, none of these is its main purpose, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis to admonish people... It has been customary among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims [in the light of the sunnah] that if one wanted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto make some sort of proclamation, he would begin with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpraises of Allah and prayers upon His Prophet, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething of that nature. Still, that is not the purpose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the khutbah; indeed, the purpose is that which is said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter praises of Allah and prayers for the prophet. If a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson delivers a khutbah and confines it to only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpraising Allah and saying prayers upon the Prophet, his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkhutbah would hardly be acceptable.

I say: this is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat the hadith is pointing to. Abu Dawud records from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tibn 'Umar that when he prayed in the mosque, he would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpray four rak'at, and when he prayed in his house, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould pray two rak'at.

It is preferred to pray them in one's house.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf one prays them in the mosque, he should change his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplace of prayer after the Friday salah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConcerning any sunnah prayer before the Friday salah, Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTaimiyyah writes: \"The Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnever offered any salah after the adhan and before the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFriday salah, and no one has ever related such an act\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom him. During the Prophet's time, there was only one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadhan and that was made when the Prophet sat upon the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpulpit. Bilal would make the adhan and then the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould give the two khutbahs. Next, Bilal would make the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tiqamah and the Prophet would lead the people in salah. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis not possible that the Prophet would have made a salah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the adhan nor anyone else among the Muslims who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayed with the Prophet could have done so. And we have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno evidence to show that the Prophet, sallallahu alehi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twasallam, prayed in his house before going out to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmosque on Friday. He did not specify any time for any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsalah before the Friday salah. What he said was meant to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texhort those going early to the mosque on Friday to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tengage themselves in prayer. He said: 'Whoever goes out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearly and walks and does not ride to the mosque and prays\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat has been prescribed [by Allah] for him...' That has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen related from the Prophet's companions. When they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould reach the mosque on Friday, they would pray\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhatever amount was easy for them. Some of them prayed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tten rak'at and some prayed twelve and some only eight and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers less than that. For this reason most of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscholars are of the opinion that there is no sunnah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayer with a specified number of rak'ah or time, before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taljumu'ah, for there is nothing either in the actions or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatements of the Prophet to support or confirm it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

Their rationale is that since\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmerchandise is a form of cash, there is no difference\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween it and dinars or dirhams in terms of which it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvalued. This means that the form of the nisab can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talternate between value in the form of cash and that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich is valued in the form of merchandise. If zakah had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot been obligatory on merchandise, the rich--or most of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem --would have converted their cash into merchandise\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor trading purposes, making sure that the nisab of gold\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand silver is never possessed by them for a year.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe main consideration here is that by levying zakah on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe rich, Allah the Exalted wants to help the poor and to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpromote the welfare of the people in general. For the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trich, its benefit lies in cleansing their persons of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstinginess--both in money and feelings. For the poor, its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbenefit lies in easing their circumstances. Zakah thus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teliminates the causes of corruption which results from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe increase of money in a few hands. It is this wisdom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich the Qur'an refers to when it deals with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistribution of booty: \"... that it becomes not a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommodity between the rich among you\" (al Hashr 7).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, it is not reasonable to exempt businessmen\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom their societal obligations when they possess most of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe nation's wealth.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOf their differences on the payment of zakah pertaining\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto plants and fruits, Ibn Rushd informs us: \"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifference of opinion lies in the fact that some jurists\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfine paying of zakah to only those items of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsumption which are generally agreed upon, while others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgo beyond those items and include dried fruits in them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoo. [The crux of the issue is]: What qualifies the four\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tedible items [wheat, barley, dates, and dried grapes] for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakah? Are they subject to zakah because of their being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdelineated as such or because of their special import to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe subsistence of life? Those who subscribe to the first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tview restrict payment of zakah to the four edibles, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who subscribe to the second view extend the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligation to all land produce except for grass,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirewood, and bamboo. There is a consensus on the latter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing excluded from zakah. However, when it comes to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuse of analogy based on a general statement, both groups\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trest on shaky ground.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe saying of the Prophet, which uses the expression\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talladhi yaqtadhi, reads: \"From what the heavens water, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttithe [is due], and from what is watered by irrigation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[nadh] a half a tithe.\" The relative pronoun ma is used\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto mean al-ladhi, which is a general expression. Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Exalted, also says: \"It is He who has brought into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing gardens--both the cultivated ones and those growing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twild--and the date palm, and fields bearing multiform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproduce, and the olive trees, and the pomegranate: all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresembling one another and yet so different. Eat of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfruit when it comes to fruition, and give unto the poor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir due on the harvest day ...\" [al-An'am 141].\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnalogically speaking, zakah aims at counteracting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoverty and this cannot be done through zakah on land\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproduce which is edible and sustains life.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRestricting a general statement with this kind of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanalogical reasoning vitiates zakah on all land produce\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcept ones which sustain life. Those who follow the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeneral import of the Prophet's saying add some more to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe generally acknowledged four items.

Malik holds that zakah on olives is obligatory,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhile ash-Shaf'i is against it, according to a latter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tview expressed in Egypt.

In its application, a generic statement is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas important as a specific one. Should there be a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconflict between the two, then the most comprehensive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill be applicable. This is the rule.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt has been said that both of the preceding hadith ought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto be followed. In their essence, they do not contradict\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teach other, nor does one of them have to cancel the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother. The Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, has to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe obeyed in this matter, for he said: \"From what the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theavens water, a tithe [is due] . . .\" This saying seeks\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto distinguish between the two (categories): one on which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta tithe is due, and the other on which only half of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttithe is due. He therefore distinguished between the two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategories only in respect to the amount due. There is no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmention of any amount of nisab in this hadith. However,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the mentioned it explicitly in another hadith which cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe ignored as something that is general or is intended to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe so and not otherwise. It is similar to other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatements of general import which have been explained in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe texts.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Qudamah concludes: \"The saying of the Prophet, upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be peace, that 'there is no sadaqah [zakah] on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything less than five awsuq' is agreed upon. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith is specific, and for this reason takes precedence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand clarifies his previous statement of general import.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is similar to his saying that 'zakah is due on all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfreely grazing camels,' which becomes explicit by his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother saying on the same subject: 'There is no sadaqah on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tless than five camels.' Likewise his saying: 'Sadaqah on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsilver is a fourth of the tithe,' becomes specific by a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlatter utterance: 'There is no sadaqah on any amount less\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan five ounces.' Thus, it is possible to have holdings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich qualify for sadaqah per se, but on which it is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlevied.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen it comes to land produce, possession of a property\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor a year cannot be used as criterion, because their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaturity or growth is completed by the time of harvest,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand not by their continuity extended beyond a year.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, possession is considered for goods other than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tland produce since it is generally assumed that by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tend of the year they must have completed their growth.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe principle of attaining a nisab on any property is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbased on the understanding that a nisab is an amount\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlarge enough to be subjected to zakah. This may be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplained by recalling that sadaqah is obligatory for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trich, which presupposes the existence of nisab generated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby their holdings. For produce which cannot be measured\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut qualifies for zakah, a sa'a is used. One sa'a is a \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeasure equal to one and one-third cups (gadah). Thus, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnisab is fifty kaylah (kaylah is a dry measure of weight,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Egypt it is equal to 16.72 L). As to the produce which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot be measured, Ibn Quadamah says: \"The nisab of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaffron, cotton and such items is to be weighed at 1,600\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIraqi pounds (ratl, an Iraqi ratl equals approximately\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t130 dirhams). Thus, its weight is estimated.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Yusuf says that if the produce cannot be measured,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen zakah can only be levied on it when its value\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattains the nisab of articles subject to the lowest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstandard of measurement. Thus, zakah will not be levied\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton cotton until its value reaches five awsuq of an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarticle to the lowest value so measured, such as barley\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the like. This is because it is impossible to measure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe article in itself except by the lower price of two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnisabs. According to Muhammad ibn al-Hasan: \"For zakah, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproduct has to reach five times the greatest value of its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkind. Thus, zakah is not payable on cotton when it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treaches five qintars, because evaluation by means of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twusuq is based on the consideration that its value is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thigher than what is valued in kind.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

As for the tithe, it is well known\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it is binding on a free Muslim, so there is no need\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto mention it. He also did not mention the levy of zakah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton cattle. This holds for the payment of zakah on silver\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand gold and other valuables. Perhaps the dahqan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(grandee) did not possess anything which required the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlevy of a tithe on it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is said that the practice of the rulers and imams was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot to combine the 'ushr and kharaj. Ibn al-Mundhir\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisapproves of such a practice because 'Umar ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abdulaziz did combine the two.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is also said that kharaj is the opposite of 'ushr.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis means that kharaj is a consequence of conquest,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhereas 'ushr is an act of worship. Therefore, the two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot be combined (at one time) and obtained\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimultaneously from the same person. This held true in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe beginning (when lands were conquered), but it is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttenable in the long run. Nevertheless, not all forms of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkharaj are based on force and conquest since some of its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforms are instituted without force as, for example, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe case of lands adjoining a kharaj land or in the case\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof acquired and revived land watered with streams.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is also said that the reason behind the imposition of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkharaj and 'ushr is one--that is, an actually or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpotentially yielding land. This can be explained by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecalling that if it is marsh land of no benefit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(sabkhah), there is no kharaj or 'ushr on it. That is,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone cause cannot demand two dues of the same kind. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis similar to the case of an individual who for a year\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossesses free-grazing camels (sa'imah) intended for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsale, for such a person is not required to pay two kinds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof zakah--that is, one for possession and one for trade.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is not the case because the 'ushr (tithe) is payable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the land's produce and the kharaj on the land itself,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregardless of whether it is planted or not. As to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmissibility of the unity of cause, alKamal ibn al-Humam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplains there is nothing to prevent two obligations from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing connected to one cause, such as land.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMost scholars are of the opinion that anyone who rents a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpiece of land and cultivates it must pay the zakah, not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe true owner of that land. To this Abu Hanifah replies:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Zakah is due on the land owner.\" Ibn Rushd holds: \"Their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifference lies in whether the 'ushr is payable on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tland itself or its produce.\" Obviously, zakah, as their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tviews suggest, is payable on either of them. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifference is only of priority, considering that both the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproduce and the land belong to the same owner. Most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscholars say that zakah is due on seeds (habb). Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHanifah holds that the essence of obligation rests with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe land. Ibn Qudamah inclines toward the majority's view\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand says: \"The obligation lies on the produce and is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpayable by its owner, as in the case of zakah on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvalue [of a property] intended for trade. Also, it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimilar to the tithe payable on the produce of the land\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towned.\" Their (the Hanafiyyah) view is not authentic, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif zakah were to be levied on the value of the land, then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit would have been obligatory even if the land was not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcultivated, as is the case with the land tax, and even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnonMuslirns would not be excluded from its application.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBe that the case, kharaj would have to be estimated on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe land itself, not on the value of produce--that is, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be considered part of the expenditure of fay', not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe expenditure of zakah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

Each is ordered not to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadd or separate his possessions to obtain a lower or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thigher sadaqah. Since the owner would naturally prefer a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlow sadaqah on his property, he would combine or separate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this possessions accordingly. The same would also be true\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the zakah collector, who might like to collect as much\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsadaqah as possible. By using the phrase khashyat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassadaqah (for fear of sadagah), the Prophet meant that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit may become more or less since both altematives were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible. This shows that he did not prefer one choice\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover the other. Therefore, he made both altematives\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible.

For example: a man possesses 120 sheep. If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey are divided into three lots of forty each, the zakah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould amount to three sheep. Another example: if they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcombine the property of one man with the property of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother, the sadaqah would increase. Thus, if a person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towns 101 sheep and another owns an equal number, then the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakah collector, if he combines the two lots, would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecure three sheep as payment toward zakah, while the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactual amount due is only two sheep.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

Allah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tExalted One, says: \"Allah has promised to the believing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen and believing women gardens of Eden\" [at-Taubah 72]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsince it is an abode for eternity.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tScholars differ about minerals (ma'din) which are subject\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto zakah. Ahmad holds that everything dug from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tground, whether created in it or buried by man, and which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas a value (such as gold, silver, iron, copper, lead,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsapphires, chrysolite, emeralds, turquoise, crystal,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagate, kohl (antimony sulfide), arsenic, tar, petroleum,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsulphur, zaj) are subject to zakah. He, however, made it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta condition that the extracted mineral should attain a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnisab either by itself or by its value. Abu Hanifah is of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe opinion that zakah is payable on any mineral that can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceive an imprint or melt by fire, such as gold, silver,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tiron, or copper. As for liquids such as tar, or a solid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmineral which cannot be melted by fire such as rubies,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is no zakah on them. In the former case, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmissibility of nisab is not a prior condition. Whether\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlarge or small in amount, a fifth will be taken as zakah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik and ash-Shaf'i hold that both gold and silver\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqualify for zakah.

They agree\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(with the Hanafiyyah) that these metals do not require\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompletion of a year to be subjected to zakah, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecomes due anytime it is available.

Furthermore,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif zakah has to be applied to the property itself, only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo situations can arise. First, zakah is payable on all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparts of that property and is applicable to any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindividual amount of it, without individual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecification. Second, if it is applicable to every part\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof it, it is impermissible to sell from any herd or grain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsince zakah collectors in this case would become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpartners. Thus, the proprietor is not allowed to take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything from it.

The Prophet, upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace, allowed him to think about his situation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfor four months and then choose for himself. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twas absent at the time but came forward later and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twent with the Muslims to fight in the battle of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHunayn before his acceptance of Islam.

Thereupon Safwwan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: \"This is a gift from someone who does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfear poverty. By Allah,\" he continued, \"the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, upon whom be peace, has given all of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthis to me and verily he is the person whom I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdislike the most, but he continued to give me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthings until he became the one I loved the most.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li><li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPeople whose evil is feared, and it is hoped that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmoney, if given to them, will neutralize their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thostility: Ibn 'Abbas reported: \"A group of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople used to come to the Prophet, upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace.

For instance, 'Uyainah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tibn Hisn, al-Aqra' ibn Habis, and al-'Abbas ibn Mirdas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame to Abu Bakr and requested their share. He wrote them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta letter, which they took to 'Umar. He tore the letter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand said: \"This is something that the Prophet, upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace, used to give you to reconcile you to Islam.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow, Allah has fortified Islam and it is no longer in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneed of you.

Then whoever will, let him believe,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand whoever will, let him disbelieve' [al Kahf 29].\" They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturned to Abu Bakr and said: \"Are you the Caliph or is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Umar? You wrote a letter for us and 'Umar tore it up.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe answered: \"This is the way it is.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Hanafiyyah continue: \"Indeed, Abu Bakr agreed with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Umar, and none of the companions disapproved of it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLikewise, it was never reported from 'Uthman or 'Ali that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey gave anything to anyone in this category.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt can be answered that the case under reference was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Umar's own judgment. He saw that there would be no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbenefit in mollifying these people after Islam had become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell-established among their people, and no harm would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollow if they abandoned Islam. Also, if 'Uthman and 'Ali\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstopped spending this kind of endowment, this does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessarily mean that the provision for it was repealed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is possible that the change of circumstances did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcall for the continuation of such an endowment to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnonbelievers. However, this does not amount to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvalidation of the provision for such endowments. Should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe contingency call for its revival, the endowments in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis category can be given. This is because their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsanction lies in the Qur'an and sunnah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad and Muslim reported from Anas that whenever the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, upon whom be peace, was asked for anything for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sake of Islam, he would give it away. A man came and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked for sadaqah. The Prophet ordered that the man be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven the entire lot of sheep between two mountains.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese sheep were part of the sadaqah. The man returned to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this people and said: \"Oh my people! Accept Islam, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindeed, Muhammad gives in such a way as if he does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfear poverty.\" Ash-Shaukani says that al-'Itrah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Jobbani, al-Balkhi, and Ibn Mubashshir held that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsadaqah may be given to those whose hearts are to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treconciled to Islam. On the contrary, ash-Shaf'i\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaintains that such endowments are not for unbelievers.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs for the sinner (faszq), he may be given from such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallocations.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Hanifah and his followers hold that this kind of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tendowment was cancelled with the spread and domination of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam and, as evidence, they cite Abu Bakr's refusal to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trestore endowments to Abu Sufyan, 'Uyainah, al-Aqra', and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-'Abbas ibn Mirdas. It appears that reconciliation is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermitted when the need for it arises. In other words, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis permitted to give them sadaqah for reconciliation when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta people obey a leader only for worldly affairs, and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot be controlled except by force and domination. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspread of Islam has no ramification on the issue of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treconciliation because it makes no difference in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcase. The author of al-Manar testifies: \"This is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole truth. Only independent judgment can be exercised\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto elaborate on the eligibility and the amount of sadaqah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor booty to be given away when they are available, along\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith other kinds of property [immovable and movable]. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis necessary to seek consultation of capable people (ahl\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tashShura) as the caliphs did in those matters that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trequired ijtihad. Whether a leader can force them into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobedience by coercive action before resorting to the use\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the endowment is an unsettled issue. Nevertheless,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis cannot be followed as a rule but rather as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprinciple of inclining to the lesser of two evils and to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe best benefit of the society.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

At-Tirmidhi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrades this report as good and sound.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs to the meaning of free captives (wa fi ar-riqab),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tash-Shaukani says that scholars differ over it. 'Ali ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Talib, Sa'id ibn Jubair, al-Layth, ath-Thauri,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-'Itrah, the Hanafiyyah, the Shaf'iyyah, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmajority of scholars are reported to believe that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefers to contracted slaves (rnukatabdn) whose freedom is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecured through payment from zakah. According to Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abbas, al-Hasan al-Basri, Malik, Ahrnad ibn Hanbal, Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThaur, and Abu 'Ubaid, it means using zakah in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelease of any kind of slave. Al-Bukhari and Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Mundhir are also supportive of this view. Their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trationale is that the expression wa fi ar-riqab cannot be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfined to the kind of slavery arising from a contract\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause, if that had been the case, then it would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfallen under the category of those in debt (gharimln),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor theirs is an obvious case of debt. As such, freeing a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave from bondage is better than helping a contracted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave. He could be aided or helped, but not freed, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe contracted slave is a slave as long as he owes even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone dirham. At the same time, freeing a slave is possible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat any time, in contrast to the situation of a contracted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCommenting on the subject, az-Zuhri says that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreceding position entails two possibilities. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'anic 'ayah on the subject alludes to these two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossibilities, which have been pointed out by ashShaukani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin his Muntaqa al-Akhbar. In the hadith narrated by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talBara', evidence suggests that redeeming necks is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same as freeing them. Nor is the deed of freeing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslaves the same as helping contracted ones with money to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpay off the contract. Both of these bring the individual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcloser to Heaven and distance him from Hell.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

In pre-Islamic times, whenever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrife took place among the Arab tribes and blood was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspilled, compensation was called for.

If other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategories are for some reason ineligible for their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare, it will be distributed among those still eligible.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is not permissible to disregard any category if it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeets the conditions for eligibility. Ibrahim anNakha'i\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsays that if the amount of zakah received is large, then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is possible to divide it among the different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategories. However, if it is small, it is permissible to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplace it into one category. Ahmad ibn Hanbal holds that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe division of zakah has a priority but that it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermissible to give it all to one category. Malik\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaintains that the distributor of zakah should make an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teffort to investigate those who are in need. He should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistribute it according to the immediate condition of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneedy and poor people. Thus, if he sees in certain years\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the poor need more, they should be given priority.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf he sees in another year that the wayfarers are more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneedy, he should distribute it among the travelers. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHanafiyyah and Sufyan athThauri thought that the zakah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpayer can choose the categories he wished to distribute\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe zakah to. This is related by Hudhaifah and Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abbas. Al-Hasan alBasri and 'Ata' ibn Abi Rabah base\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir opinions on it.

Spelling out these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategories does not mean that the zakah has to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistributed among them equally or even that it has to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivided among them. The intended meaning, however, is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the categories of sadaqah are similar to various\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgroups of people who are eligible for it. Thus, one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis obligated to pay anything to any category of sadaqah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand gives it to a person in a parallel group is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsidered to be fulfilling what Allah commanded him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo. Contrary to this, if one divides his zakah due into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe acknowledged eight categories, if all eight exist,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen that would not only be contrary to the practice of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims throughout history, but it would cause\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thardship to the payer of zakah. For example, if the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcollected zakah were meager, it would be of no benefit to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany designated category--even if it was of one kind, to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay nothing if it was of numerous kinds. To endorse such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta practice would be tantamount to counter what the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, upon whom be peace, did when he permitted the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpayment of a penance (kaffarah) from the charity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcollected for Salmah ibn Sakhr. Obviously, the hadith of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas-Suda'i cannot be used as evidence.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere is not a single case in the entire corpus of hadith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tliterature which could be used to make the distribution\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof zakah to all groups of people obligatory. Using the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith of Mu'adh as evidence that the Prophet, upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace, instructed him to take zakah from the rich\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYemenites and give it to their poor will not be of much\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelp because it does not establish that the zakah was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistributed to all the groups. Nor is the hadith of Ziyad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tibn al-Harith as-Suda'i valid in this regard because in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits chain of narrators is 'Abdur-Rahman ibn Ziyad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-'Afriqi, whose credibility has been questioned by many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscholars. Assuming that this hadith is valid for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoint under discussion, the meaning of the division of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakah into parts is its distribution according to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapparent meaning of the Qur'anic 'ayah and what the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, upon whom be peace, had in mind. Assuming that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe division of zakah itself is intended, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistribution has to be done according to the specified\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategories. In this case, any transfer of the share of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone group to another, even if the group concerned was for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome reason non-existent, will not be permissible. Such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan approach will be contrary to the consensus of Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscholars. If we accept that, then the deciding factor for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sadaqah's distribution is the leader's wish rather\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan, and not the specific categories of eligible people.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThus, there is no evidence that makes division\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligatory, and it is consequently permissible to give\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome sadaqah to those eligible people and some to other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgroups. Indeed, when the leader collects all the sadaqat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom his people and all eight categories are eligible to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceive them, each group has the right to claim its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare. However, he does not have to divide the collected\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsadaqat among them equally or distribute it without any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistinction, for he can give any amount to any group or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgroups that he wants to, or he can give some without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiving the rest if he thinks it is in the interest of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam and its people. For example, if the sadaqah was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcollected and then a jihad was announced, meaning that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould become necessary to defend the territory of Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst the unbelievers, the leader can give some or all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof it to the deserving warriors. This also applies to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother concerns if the interest of Islam necessitates it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

Do not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeny Banu Hashim the grace of their position because\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah placed you among them. How about our brothers Banu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Muttalib?

Then he joined his fingers [in demonstrating\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe close relationship].\" Reason dictates that one should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot differentiate between them (the two families) in any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter of law because they are one according to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying of the Prophet. It is evident that they are the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfamily of Muhammad, and therefore, sadaqat are forbidden\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto them. Abu Hanifah holds that the family of Banu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Muttalib may take from zakah. Both these reports are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated by Ahmad. Just as the Messenger of Allah, upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be peace, made charity unlawful for the family of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBanu Hashim, he also made it unlawful for their proteges\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(mawla).

There is no portion in it for a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twealthy person or a healthy individual who is eaming.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Qudamah says: \"If he would have considered the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treality of the rich person, he would not have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontented with what they said [conceming this matter].\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe opinion of Malik, ash-Shaf'i, Abu Yusuf, ath-Thauri,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Ibn al-Mundhir is that it will not be sufficient for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta zakah payer to give it to the undeserving, especially\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen his mistake becomes clear. In that case, he should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpay zakah once again to those who deserve it. His case is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimilar to the case of unpaid debts (owed) to other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople. Ahmad says that there are two opinions conceming\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone paying zakah to a person whom he thought was poor and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlater leamed was rich. The first contends it would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsidered paid, while the second says that it would not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe. When it becomes known that one who received zakah is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta slave, an unbeliever, a Hashimite (a person from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's family), or an ineligible relative of the zakah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpayer, then one has not discharged one's obligation, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason being that it is difficult to know who is rich and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho is poor: \"The ignorant man thinks that since they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[who do not ask for] are modest they are free from want\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[al-Baqarah 273].\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam views wealth realistically--as an essential aspect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof life and the main means of subsistence of individuals\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand groups. Allah, the Exalted One, instructs: \"Give not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto those who are weak of understanding [what is in] your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twealth which Allah has made a means of support for you\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[an-Nisa' 5]. This amounts to saying that wealth is to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistributed to meet the basic needs of food, clothing,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlodging, and other indispensables, and that no one is to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe lost, forgotten, or left without support. The best way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto distribute wealth so that everyone's basic needs are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmet is through zakah. It does not place any burden on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twealthy yet at the same time it meets the basic needs of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe poor and relieves them of the hardships of life and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe pain of deprivation. Zakah is not a favor (minnah)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the wealthy bestow upon the poor; rather, it is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdue (haqq) that Allah entrusted in the hands of the rich\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto deliver to the poor and distribute among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeserving. Thus, the eminent truth about wealth and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty is established--that is, wealth is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texclusively for the rich but for both the rich and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoor. This becomes obvious because of Allah's judgment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerning the distribution of booty (fay'). Allah warns:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\". . . that it does not become a commodity taken by turns\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the rich of you\" [al-Hashr 7].

If the amount of zakah is not enough to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talleviate the conditions of the poor and the needy, then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe rich can be subjected to further taxation.

The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontribution is not based on a specific amount of nisab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut on the ability to give. Thus, if someone possesses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly a loaf of bread and sees a person who is more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thard-pressed than himself, he should give it to that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson.

It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, upon whom be peace, said: \"He whose holdings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texceed his needs, let him support the one whose holdings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo not, and he whose food exceeds his needs, let him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare it with him who does not have food.\" Abu Sa'id\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Khudri says: \"Then he mentioned so many kinds of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty that we thought no one of us had the right to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave anything surplus with us.\" This is the consensus of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe companions, as it was reported by Abu Sa'id alKhudri.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConcerning this tradition, it is reported on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority of Abu Musa al-Ash'ari that the Prophet, upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be peace, said: \"Feed the hungry, visit the sick,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand ransom the prisoner.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere are many 'ayahs in the Qur'an and numerous sound\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith on this subject.

Then he said: \"It is not permissible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor a hard-pressed Muslim to eat the meat of a dead\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanimal or a pig when he can find surplus food from either\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta Muslim or a dhimmi. It is an obligation of the one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas food to feed the hungry.\" This has the consensus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the companions, and there are no contrary views\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerning it. It was accurately reported from ashShu'bi,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMujahid, Tawus, and others that: \"There is a due on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty other than zakah.\" If such is the case, then a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thard-pressed person is not forced to eat the meat of dead\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanimals or pigs. He has the right to fight for it and, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the is killed, then retaliation by killing (qawad) will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timposed upon the killer. If the property holder who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevents him from receiving his due is killed, then may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the have the curse of Allah upon him because he withheld a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright (haqq), and he will be regarded as being among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunjust.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, the Exalted One, says: \"And if one party of them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes wrong to the other, fight those who do wrong until\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey return to the ordinance of Allah.\" Thus, one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithholds a right is an oppressor of his brother. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlatter is the possessor of that right. On this basis, Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBakr as-Siddiq waged war against those who refused to pay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir zakah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFrom the preceding, one can see the degree of compassion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand commiseration that Islam has for the deprived.

Allah says in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an: \"And [for] him who is sick among you or on a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjourney, [the same] number of other days.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMu'adh said: \"Verily, Allah made the fast obligatory upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet by revealing: 'O you who believe, fasting is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou...' until the words, 'And for those who can fast [but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo not] there is a \"ransom\" payment...' Then, whoever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twished to do so would fast and whoever wished to do so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould feed a poor person, and that was sufficient for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem. Then Allah revealed another verse: 'The month of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRamadan in which the Qur'an was revealed...' to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords: 'Whoever is resident among you during this month\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis to fast.' [By this verse,] the fast was established\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor those who were resident and healthy. A concession was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade for the sick and travelers, and the feeding of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoor by the elderly who could not fast was [left]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfirmed.\" This is related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talBaihaqi with a sahih chain.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA sick person may break his fast which, if continued,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould only aggravate the illness or delay its cure.In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Mughni it is stated: \"It is related from some of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearly scholars that any type of illness allows one to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak the fast, even an injury to the finger or a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoothache. They based their opinion on the following: \\n\\t\\t\\t</p><ul><li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe wording of the verse is general and applies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto all types of illness, and \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li><li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta traveler is allowed to break his fast even if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\the does not need to and, therefore, the same must\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbe the case for one who is sick.\" This was also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe opinion of al-Bukhari, 'Ata, and the Dhahiri\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tschool of thought.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li></ul><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOne who is healthy but fears that he will become ill if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the fasts can break the fast, as can the person who is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tovercome by hunger and/or thirst and fears that he may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdie because of it, even if he is resident and healthy. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmust make up the days of fasting that he missed. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowing two Qur'anic 'ayahs support this point: \"And do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot kill yourselves, Lo! Allah is ever Merciful to you,\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand \"He has not laid upon you in your religion any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thardship.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf a sick person fasts and withstands the hardships of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fast, his fast will be valid but disliked, for he did\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot accept the concession Allah gave him, thereby causing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself much hardship. Some of the companions would fast\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduring the Prophet's lifetime while others would not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(that is, if they were ill), thereby following the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverdict of the Prophet. Hamzah al-Aslami said: \"O\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah, I find within me the strength to fast\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhile traveling. Would there be any blame upon me if I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere to do so?\" The Prophet, upon whom be peace,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanswered: \"It is a concession from Allah. Whoever takes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit has done well. Whoever likes to fast, there is no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblame upon him.\" This is related by Muslim.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Sa'id al-Khudri reported: \"We traveled with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah to Makkah while we were fasting. We\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstopped at a place and the Messenger of Allah said: 'You\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare coming close to your enemies. You will be stronger if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou break the fast.' That was a concession and some of us\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfasted and some of us broke our fasts. Then we came to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother place and the Prophet said: 'In the morning you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill face your enemy. Breaking the fast will give you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore strength.' So we broke our fast, taking that as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbest course of action. After that, you could see some of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tus fasting with the Prophet while traveling.\" This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated by Ahmad, Muslim, and Abu Dawud.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn another report, Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: \"We fought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunder the leadership of the Messenger of Allah during\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRamadan. Some of us fasted and some of us did not. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tones who fasted did not find any fault with those who did\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot fast, and those who did not fast found no fault with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who fasted. They knew that if one had the strength\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto fast he could do so and it was good, and that if one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas weak, he was allowed to break his fast, and that was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgood.\" This is related by Ahmad and Muslim.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe jurists differ over what is preferred (that is, to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfast or not to fast while traveling). Abu Hanifah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tash-Shaf'i, and Malik are of the opinion that if one has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe ability to fast, it is better for him to do so, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif one does not have the ability to fast, it is better\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor him to break the fast. Ahmad said that it is best to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak the fast. 'Umar ibn 'Abdulaziz says: \"The best of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe two acts is the easier of the two. If it is easier\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor one to fast than to make up the day later on, then,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin his case, to fast is better.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAsh-Shaukani has concluded that if it is difficult for an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindividual to fast or to reject the concession, then it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis best for him not to fast (while traveling). Similarly,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif one fears that one's fasting during travel will look\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike showing off, then in this case, breaking the fast\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be preferred. If one is not faced with such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions, then fasting would be preferred.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf a traveler makes the intention (to fast) during the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnight, he can still break his fast during the day. Jabir\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tibn 'Abdullah reported:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Messenger of Allah left for Makkah during the year\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the conquest [of Makkah] and he and the people with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim fasted until he reached a certain valley. He then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcalled for a cup of water, which he elevated so that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople could see it, and then he drank. Afterwards, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas told that some people had continued to fast, and he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: 'Those are disobedient ones, those are disobedient\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tones.' \" This is related by Muslim, at-Tirmidhi, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi called it sahih.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf one has already made the intention to fast while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresident but then decided to travel during the day, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmajority of scholars maintain that he must fast. Ahmad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Ishaq say that he may break the fast. This opinion is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbased on the report of Muhammad ibn Ka'b who said: \"I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame to Anas ibn Malik during Ramadan while he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplanning on traveling. His mount was prepared for him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand he was wearing his clothes for traveling. He asked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor some food and ate. I said to him: 'Is this a sunnah?'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe said, 'Yes.' Then he mounted his animal and left.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is related by at-Tirmidhi, who called it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thassan.'Ubaid ibn Jubair said: \"During Ramadan, I rode on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta ship with Abu Basra al-Ghafari from al-Fustat. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprepared his food and said, \"Come [and eat].\" I said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Are we not still among the houses [of the city - that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis, they had not left yet]?\" Abu Basra asked: \"Are you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tturning away from the sunnah of the Messenger of Allah?\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is related by Ahmad and Abu Dawud. Its narrators are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrustworthy.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAsh-Shaukani contends: \"These two hadith prove that a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraveler may break his fast before he begins his joumey.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOf its credentials, Ibn al-'Arabi says: 'Concerning the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith of Anas, it is sahih and proves that one can break\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fast when he is prepared to travel.'\" This is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorrect position.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe type of travel that allows one to break his fast is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same as the traveling which allows one to shorten the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayers. We have discussed all of the opinions on this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoint under the section Shortening the Prayers, and we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave also recorded Ibn al-Qayyim's conclusions on this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestion.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad, Abu Dawud, al-Baihaqi, and at-Tahawi recorded from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMansur al-Kalbi that Dihya ibn Khalifah traveled a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistance of one farsakh during Ramadan. When he broke his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfast, some of the people accompanying him did likewise.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSome of them did not agree with this action. On his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn to his city, Dihya said: \"I saw some hing today\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat I did not suspect I would ever see. The people tumed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taway the Messenger of Allah's guidance and that of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanions.\" He said that about the people who had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfasted. Then he said: \"O Allah, take [my soul] to you.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAll of its narrators are trustworthy, except for Mansur\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Kalbi... although al-'Ijli affirms his credibility.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

If he had done so, his companions would have known\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout it and would have passed it on to the rest of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims. Since no one has related that not from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, not with an authentic or a weak hadith, nor in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmursal or musnad form then it must be the case that such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacts do not void [the fast].\" He also says: \"If the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\truling is one that would affect everyone or everyday\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatters, then the Prophet would have clarified it to a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeneral audience. It is well-known that kohl was in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommon use as were oils, washing, incense, and perfume.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf they broke the fast, the Prophet would have mentioned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem, as he mentioned other things [that break the fast].\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSince he did not do so, they belong to the class of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperfumes, incense, and dyes. Incense goes through the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnose and enters the head and lands on the body. Dyes or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toils are absorbed by the skin and the body is refreshened\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby it. The case of perfumes is similar. Since these have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot been [explicitly] prohibited to the fasting person,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit points to the fact that using them is permissible for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fasting person and so is kohl. The Muslims during the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime of the Prophet would injure themselves, either from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjihad or otherwise, and would injure their stomachs or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tskulls. If that would have ended their fasts, it would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been made clear to them [by the Prophet].\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSince that was not prohibited for the fasting person, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmust not break the fast.\" Ibn Taimiyyah continues: \"No\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone eats kohl and no one causes it to enter his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstomach--neither through his nose nor through his mouth.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnal enemas are also not taken as food. Indeed, it helps\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe body to release whatever is in the intestines and it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes not reach the stomach. Any medicine that is used to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreat stomach wounds or head injuries [that is taken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torally] is not considered similar to food.

He said: 'I have not heard of any.' \" In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Mughni it is stated: \"This refers to the fact that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet ordered the man who had had sexual intercourse to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfree a slave. He did not order the woman to do anything,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talthough he obviously knew that she was a partner in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tact.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to most scholars, acts of expiation must be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformed in the order that was mentioned in the hadith.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe first command is to free a slave. If this is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible, the person is to fast for two consecutive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmonths. If that is not possible, the person is to feed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsixty poor people with meals that are similar to an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taverage meal in his household. The person cannot jump\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom one act to another unless he is not able to perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe prior order commanded. According to the Malikiyyah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand a narration from Ahmad, the person is free to choose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany of the above three acts and that will be sufficient\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor him.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis latter opinion is based on the report from Malik and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Juraij on the authority of Humaid ibn 'Abdurrahman\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho reported that Abu Hurairah narrated that a man broke\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this fast during Ramadan and the Prophet ordered him, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan expiation, to free a slave or fast two months\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsecutively or to feed sixty poor people. This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated by Muslim.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the preceding hadith, the word \"or\" implies choice,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut according to some, the reason for the expiation to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformed was different and therefore the person could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchoose, as in the case of the expiation for breaking an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toath. Ash-Shaukani says: \"In the different narrations,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is evidence that the expiation is to be performed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin order or according to one's choice. Those who relate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit to be in order are more in number. Al-Muhallab and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Qurtubi combined the narrations and said that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevent [of someone breaking the fast] occurred more than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonce.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Hafidh differs: \"This is not correct. It was just one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevent and the parts are all united. So the crux of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter is that there was not more than one event. Some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcombine the reports and say that following the order is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreferred, but that one may choose. Others say the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topposite.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhoever has sexual intercourse (with his wife) on a day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Ramadan and, before he performs the act of expiation,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas intercourse on another day of Ramadan, need only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperform one act of expiation according to a narration\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Ahmad and the Hanafiyyah. This is because there is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunishment for acts that are repeated, and if the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpiation or punishment is not carried out, all the acts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare taken together as one. According to Malik,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tash-Shaf'i, and Ahmad, the person must perform the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpiation twice, as each day of Ramadan is a separate act\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof worship. If the expiation is obligatory because the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson voided the fast, the separate acts are not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcombined together.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAll scholars agree that if the person intentionally had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercourse during a day of Ramadan and has performed the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpiation and then has intercourse on another day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRamadan, then another expiation becomes obligatory upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim. Similarly, they are in agreement that if one has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercourse twice during a day, before performing the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpiation for the first act, then he need only perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone act of expiation. If he has performed the expiation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the first one, then he need not perform an act of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpiation for the second, according to most scholars.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad says that in such a case, he must perform a total\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof two acts of expiation.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

'Ali said: \"What blame would there be upon you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif you go to the market to buy one?\" Qatadah used to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermit the person who was performing i'tikaf to follow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe funeral procession and to visit the sick, but not to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsit while doing so.

He said: \"The one who is performing i'tikaf\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould not enter a roofed place unless there is a need to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo so.\" Al-Khattabi says: \"A group of people say that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson performing i'tikaf may attend the Friday prayer,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvisit the ill, and witness funerals.

This is one of the types of words that have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore than one meaning. Those who say that it carries both\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeanings interpret 'touch' in the 'ayah . . . 'and touch\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem not and be at your devotions in the mosque' in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunrestrictive sense--that is, covering both sexual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercourse and also actions [of touching] that are less\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan that. Those who don't say it carries all of its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeanings and they are the majority say that the 'ayah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoints to sexual intercourse or to touching that is less\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan intercourse. If we say that it refers to sexual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercourse by consensus, then this nullifies the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossibility of it referring to actions less than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercourse, as one [single] word could not be taken in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits literal and figurative meaning [at the same time].\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThose who say that what is less than sexual intercourse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis included say so because it falls under the literal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaning of the verse.

It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnarrated on the authority of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Prophet, peace be upon him, said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Prompt your dying people to say: 'La ilaha\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tilla-Allah'.\" (Muslim, Abu Daw'ud, Tirmidhi)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnother report on the authority of Mu'adh ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJabal states that the Messenger of Allah, peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbe upon him, said: \"He whose last words are 'La\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tilaha illa- Allah' shall enter Paradise.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Narrated by Abu Daw'ud; Al-Hakim considers it a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsound hadith)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li></ul><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis prompting (talqin) is necessary only when the dying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson is unable to utter the shahadah (La ilaha illa-\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah . . . ). If such a person is able to utter these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords then there is no need for prompting, but he should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trather be advised to do so. Such advice is useful in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcases of persons who are in possession of their faculties\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof reason and speech. If one is already mentally impaired\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch advice cannot be of benefit. But one who is unable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto speak might say these words in his heart. The scholars\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare of the opinion that no pressure should be put on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdying person. So one should not say to him, \"Say, 'La\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tilaha ill-Allah',\" lest he should become annoyed and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tutter something improper. One may say the shahadah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, in such a way that the dying person might be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\table to hear it and repeat it. If he utters it once, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould not be asked to repeat it unless he says some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords after it. In such a case he should be asked to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepeat shahadah to ensure that it be his last utterance.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMost scholars are of the opinion that one attending a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdying person may repeat only the words: \"La ilaha\\n\\t\\t\\t\\till-Allah,\" according to the apparent meaning of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith. Others are of the opinion that the dying person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be prompted to utter the two testimonies (that is,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbear witness that Muhammad is His servant and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger\"). The purpose is to remind him of the Oneness\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah, which includes both of the two testimonies.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad reported that Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace be upon him, at the time of her death, turned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoward the Ka'bah and placed her right hand under her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thead. This is the sleeping position recommended by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, peace be upon him, and in a grave, a dead body\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould also be placed in the same position. A report\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecorded from Ash-Shafi'i says: The body of the deceased\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be laid flat on his back with his feet toward the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKa'bah, and his face raised a little, facing it. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmajority of scholars, however favor the first position\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand hold it to be preferable.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Hibban observes: This hadith refers to the recitation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Ya Sin for those on the eve of death and not for those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talready dead. This interpretation is supported by Ahmad,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho recorded in his Al-Musnad that Safwan states: \"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost eminent scholars say: 'The recitation of Surah Ya\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSin at the time of a person's death makes death easy for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim'. \"The compiler of Musnad al-Firdaus attributes this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith to Abu ad-Darda and Abu Dharr. They both narrated:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: 'If any person is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton his deathbed and Ya Sin is recited to him, Allah makes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this suffering easier'.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere is a consensus among scholars regarding the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermissibility of kissing a dead person. The Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace be upon him, kissed 'Uthman ibn Maz'un after his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath. Similarly, when the Prophet died, Abu Bakr leaned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover him and kissed him between his eyes saying: \"O my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet! O my best friend! !\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe guardian of the deceased should wash, wrap, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarrange for the burial of the body soon after the funeral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayer for the deceased, because the body might\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeteriorate if burial is delayed. This is based on a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treport, recorded by Abu Daw'ud from al-Husayn ibn Wujuh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat when Talhah ibn al-Bara fell ill, the Prophet, peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, said: \"I see that Talhah is on the verge of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath. Inform me about him (when he passes away) and make\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timmediate preparations for his burial, for a Muslim's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremains should not be left long with his family after his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe burial may be delayed only for the guardian, provided\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno physical deterioration in the condition of the body is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfeared from such delay. Ahmad and Tirmidhi report on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority of Ali ibn Abu Talib that the Prophet, peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, said: \"O Ali, never delay three things: prayer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen its time approaches, the funeral when death is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfirmed, and marrying a widow or a divorcee when a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuitable match is found for her.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis means that the judgement regarding a soul's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsalvation or perdition or its entry into Paradise is held\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin abeyance until its debts are fully paid off and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettled. This applies to a person who leaves some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty upon his death. His debt should be paid out of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe property that he leaves behind. In the case of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson who dies in debt which he sincerely intended to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpay, but has no property (nor leaves any behind to pay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this debt), according to a confirmed report, his debt will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe settled by Allah, the Exalted. Concerning a person who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdies in debt with sufficient means to pay it and was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twilling to do so, but his heirs do not pay it, Bukhari\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecords on the authority of Abu Hurayrah that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, peace be upon him, said: \"If anyone takes other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople's money with the intention to repay it and then he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor she should die without settling the debt, Allah will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpay the debt on his behalf. And if anyone takes money or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty (of others) with the intention of destroying it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah will destroy him.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA hadith recorded by Ahmad, Abu Nu'aym, Al-Bazzar, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt-Tabarani from the Prophet, peace be upon him, says:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The debtor will be summoned before Allah on the Day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJudgement. Then Allah will ask him: 'O Son of Adam ! Why\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid you incur debt and infringe on others ' rights? ' The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman would reply: 'My Lord! You know I took it, but I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneither abused nor lost it. It was stolen or bumed in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfire or lost its value.' Allah, the Almighty and Exalted,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill say: 'My slave has told the truth, and I am more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentitled (than anyone else) to settle his debt. Then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah will issue a command and something will be placed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton his scales causing his good deeds to outweigh his bad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tones. And so, by Allah's Grace, he will enter Paradise'.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Prophet, peace be upon him, did not perform funeral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayers for those who had died in debt. When, however,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah the Almighty, granted him certain lands as a result\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof conquests, and the community's wealth increased, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffered funeral prayer for them and settled their debts.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBukhari reports that the Messenger of Allah, peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, said: \"I am nearer to the believers than their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\town selves. So if someone dies leaving behind debt, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno wherewithal to settle it, we shall pay his debt, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif someone dies and leaves some estate behind him, it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor his heirs (to pay his debt).\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis hadith shows that the debt of a deceased Muslim may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe paid from the public exchequer out of the zakah funds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecified as the portion for the people in debt. This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone of the prescribed categories of zakah recipients.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDeath by itself does not annul one's debt or other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponsibilities to the living.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

It is recommended that the body be placed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton an elevated surface i.e., a table or a board. It then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be stripped of clothes, but his 'awra (private\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparts) should be covered. (Ash-Shafi'i says that it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetter to wash the body of the deceased wearing a shirt,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif it is thin enough to let water reach the body. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, peace be upon him, was washed this way, but it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas done only in his case. The common practice has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto cover the 'awra and wash the body) At the washing,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly people whose presence is needed may stay.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe washer, male or female, must be a trustworthy and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpious person who will not broadcast what he or she might\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsee except what is good.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Majah reports that the Prophet, peace be upon him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: \"Trustworthy persons should wash your dead.\" A\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twasher must utter his or her intention to wash the body\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof a specific person. Then he should begin by lightly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpressing the stomach of the deceased so as to expel, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible, any remnants from it, and then wash the body of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall impurities. The washer should use a wash cloth or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrap his or her hand with it, because touching the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprivate parts of the dead is haram (forbidden). Then he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor she should wash the deceased as in wudu (ablution) for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe salah (obligatory prayers). The Prophet, peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, is reported to have said: \"Begin washing the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdead by washing organs on the right, and those parts that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare washed in ablution.\" This is in order to crystalize\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mark of the believer's parts of the body always\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twashed during wudu that will shine forth brightly on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDay of Judgement. Then beginning from its right side, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbody should be washed with soap and water, three times.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf soap is not available, then washing with ordinary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twater will suffice. If the washer feels that three washes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare not enough to cleanse the body properly, then he may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twash it five or seven times. According to a sahih hadith,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"Wash the dead body\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan odd number of times, that is, three, five, or seven,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor more if you feel it is necessary.\" (Ibn Abd al-Barr\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobserves: \"I know about no one who recommended more than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseven washes.\" Ahmad and Ibn al-Mundhir disliked to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texceed beyond seven)\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn al-Mundhir said: \"The Prophet instructed the female\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twashers to wash the dead body more than seven times in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcase they felt it was necessary to do so, but it must be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan odd number of times. If the deceased is a female, then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther hair should be loosened, washed, redone, and placed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehind her back. According to a hadith narrated by Umm\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Atiyyah the hair of the Prophet's daughter was done in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree plaits. I asked: 'Did they loosen her hair and then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tredo them in three braids?' She said: 'Yes'.\" Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treports this in these words: \"We braided her hair in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree braids, on both sides and in front (of her).\" In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Sahih, Ibn Hibban says: \"They did so in compliance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the order of the Prophet: 'Do her hair in three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplaits'.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter having washed the body, it should be dried with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclean cloth lest the shroud should get wet. Then some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperfume should be applied to it. The Prophet, peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, said: \"When you apply perfume (to the dead),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapply it an odd number of times after washing it.\" This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis reported by AlBaihaqi, Al-Hakim and Ibn Hibban, of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom the last two consider it a sound hadith.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Wa'il said: \"Ali had some musk, and he requested that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit be applied to his body upon his death. This was of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat was left from the perfume used on the body of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet upon his death.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe majority of scholars are of the opinion that clipping\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta deceased's finger nails, trimming his mustache, shaving\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe hair under his arms or from his private parts is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmakruh (disliked). Ibn Hazm, however, considers it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermissible.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe scholars are agreed that the body of the deceased be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trewashed if the stomach excrete something (i.e., urine or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstool) after it had been washed and prior to being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshrouded. They differ, however, whether in such a case\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe entire body should be rewashed. Some hold that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbody must be washed again in such a case. Others are of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe opinion that there is no need to wash the whole body\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagain, while still others hold that at least wudu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(ablution) must be repeated in such a case. Some others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thold that in such a case the entire washing must be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepeated.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe opinions of most scholars concerning washing of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdead are based on the hadith transmitted by the group on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe authority of Umm 'Atiyyah who said: \"The Prophet came\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto our house when his daughter died, and said: 'Wash her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree times, five times, or more than that if you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsider it necessary, with water and sidr (lotus tree\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleaves), and after the last wash apply some camphor to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe body, and inform me after you have done so.' So when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twe finished washing we informed him. He gave us a cloth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he wore around his waist, and told us to wrap her in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit as a first sheet of shroud.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe reason for using camphor, as mentioned by some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscholars, is its pleasant smell, since burial is a time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen angels are present. Besides, it is cool and has a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsoothing effect, especially when the body stiffens, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelps keep various insects away from the body, thus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreventing its early decomposition. In case camphor is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot available, any other substance that has these or some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof these properties may be used instead.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

But, when the angels left, I rode the mount.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis was narrated by Abu Daw'ud, Al-Baihaqi, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Hakim, who said this hadith is sound according to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcriterion of Muslim and Bukhari. Tirmidhi narrated that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet, peace be upon him, walked with the funeral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Ibn Ad-Dahdah, but on his way back he rode on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thorseback.

This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\targument is based only on their silence about the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice, and silence is not proof when a matter rests on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmere assumption, for prohibition of raising graves is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresumptive.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIncluded in the discussion of raising the grave are dome\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbuildings, shrines built on graves, and erecting mosques\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taround graves.The Prophet, peace be upon him, cursed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who did that. The practice of erecting buildings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taround graves and beautifying them causes corruption,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich Islam seeks to eliminate.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPart of such a corruption is exaggerating the importance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof graves, in accordance with the superstitious belief of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe ignorant, similar to the belief of non-believers in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir idols, that these monuments can bring benefit or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevent harm. Thus they travel to these graves for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfulfillment of their needs or achievement of their goals.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey ask those in the graves what believers should ask\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly of their Lord. They ride horses to them, touch them,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand seek their aid. In general, they do exactly what the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpre-Islamic people used to do with their idols.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDespite this disgraceful, reprehensible evil and hideous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelief, how many people dare to take a stand for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcause of Allah, or evince any uneasiness for the defense\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the true din? Where are the scholars and students, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe rulers, the ministers, and the kings, who are obliged\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto teach the truth? Various reports reaching us leave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlittle doubt that many of these grave adorers, in fact\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost of them, when confronted and asked under oath to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treject such idolatry would readily take a solemn oath\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfalsely by Allah. But if you then ask them, \"(Swear) by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour spiritual leader and your saint, so-and-so,\" they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill ponder, apologize, refuse, and confess the truth.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is one of the clearest proofs that their polytheism\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis indeed worse than that of the Christians and others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho say: \"Allah, the Exalted, is the second of two or the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthird of three.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tO scholars of Islam!

In all such cases, transferring of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbody from one place to another is permissible provided\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits sanctity is not affected, e.g., it does not bloat,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes not decompose or its bones do not break.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Hanafi school considers the removal of a body from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone place to another undesirable, and holds it preferable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto bury a person at the place of death. The body may be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken for a mile or two for burial, for that is the usual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistance to a cemetery. After the burial removing the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbody without a genuine reason is not permissible as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned above. If a woman's son dies and he is buried\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin her absence in another town, and she was impatient and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twanted to remove his body to her own town, her request\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmay not be heeded.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Hanbali school considers it desirable to bury a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmartyr at the place where he or she is killed. Ahmad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"As to those who are slain, a hadith reported by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJabir from the Prophet, peace be upon him, says: 'Bury\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe martyrs wherever they are killed'.\" Ibn Majah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treported: \"The Prophet, peace be upon him, ordered that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe martyrs of the Battle of Uhud be returned and buried\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat the places where they had fallen.\" As for the others,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey are not to be removed from one town to another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout a valid cause. This is the opinion of AlAwza'i\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Ibn al-Mundhir. Abdallah ibn Malikah said: \"Abd-ur\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRahman ibn Abu Bakr died in Abyssinia and his body was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcarried to Makkah where he was buried. When 'Aishah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvisited his grave she said: 'By Allah!

And had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI seen you there, I would not have visited you'.\" Burying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe deceased at the place of death is easier and more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecure against deterioration of the physical remains.

I did not recognize you.' The Prophet, peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, said, 'Verily patience is needed at the time of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe first affiction'.'' (Bukhari and Muslim) This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupports the argument in favor of the permissibility of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen visiting graves, for the Prophet, peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, saw her at the grave and did not show his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisapproval of it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe purpose of visiting graves is to remember the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter, which is something that both men and women\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneed. Men are by no means more in need of this reminder\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan women. Some scholars disliked it for women to visit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgraves as they are less patient and too emotional. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, peace be upon him, said, \"May Allah curse the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen who are frequent visitors of the graves.\" (Reported\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Ahmad, Ibn Majah, and Tirmidhi, who said that it is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsound hadith)\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Qurtubi said: \"The curse mentioned in this hadith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapplies only to those women who visit graves frequently.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe reason for this curse lies perhaps in the fact that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit involves infringement of the rights of the husband,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand leads to adornment and exhibition of their beauty to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrangers, and shouting, yelling, and other similar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthings.\" It may be said that, \"If no such harm is feared\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom women visiting graves, then there is no valid reason\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor preventing them from visiting graves, for indeed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremembrance of death is something that both men and women\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tequally need.\" Commenting on Al-Qurtubi's view,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAsh-Shawkani said, \"This statement may form the basis for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treconciling apparently contradictory hadith.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

As for a non-believer or a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrite, he will respond to the angels, \"I do not know,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut I used to say what the people used to say ! \" It will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe said to him, \"Neither did you know nor did you seek\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguidance from those who had knowledge.\" Then he will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thit with an iron hammer between his two ears, and he will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcry and that cry will be heard by all except human beings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand jinns'.\" (Bukhari and Muslim)\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Bara ibn 'Azib reported: The Prophet, peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, said, 'When a Muslim is questioned in his grave, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbears witness that there is no god but Allah, and that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad is the Messenger of Allah.' According to one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treport, the verse, 'Allah will establish in strength\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who believe with the Word, that stands firm in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld and in the Hereafter' (Qur'an 14.27) was revealed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerning the punishment of the grave. The deceased will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe asked, 'Who is your Lord?' He will say, 'Allah is my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLord and Muhammad is my Prophet.' That is what is meant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the statement of Allah, 'Allah will make firm those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho believe with a firm statement in this life and in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thereafter'.\" (Al-Bukhari, Muslim, and Sunan)\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad and Abu Hatim reported that the Prophet, peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, said, \"When a deceased person is laid in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrave, he hears the sound of the footsteps of people as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey go away. If he is a believer, the prayer will stand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby his head, the fasting will be to his right, alms to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this left, and all other good deeds of charity, kindness\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto relations, and good behavior will be by his feet. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeceased will be questioned by the angels at his head.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe prayer will say, 'There is no entrance through me.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen he will be questioned by his right side where\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfasting will say, 'There is no entrance through me.' Then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the will be questioned by his left side where charity will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay, 'There is no entrance through me.' Then he will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestioned by his feet where the good acts of voluntary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharity, kindness to relations, and good behavior will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay, 'There is no entrance through me.' Then they will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay to him, 'Get up.'And he will get up. The sun will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappear to him and it will begin to set. Then they will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\task, 'This man who was among you, what do you say about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim? What is your testimony about him?' The man will say,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Let me pray.' The angels will say, 'You will pray.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnswer our question. What do you think about this man who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas among you? What do you say concerning him? What do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou testify concerning him?' The deceased will say, I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbear witness that Muhammad was the Messenger of Allah who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrought the truth from Allah.' The deceased will be told,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'According to this you lived, died, and according to this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou will be resurrected, if Allah wills.'\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Then a door to Paradise will be opened for him. He will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe told, 'This is your place in Paradise and what Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas prepared for you. ' At this the desire and happiness\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the deceased will increase. His grave will be enlarged\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t70 arms-length and his grave will be lit up. His body\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill change to his original form and his spirit will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplaced in a bird dangling by the trees of Paradise in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnice breeze.\" The Prophet, peace be upon him, added,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"That is what is meant by the statement of Allah, 'Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill establish in strength those who believe with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWord that stands firm, in this world and in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter'.\" He also mentioned the unbeliever and said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"His grave will be compressed, so that his ribs will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcrushed together. About this the Qur'an says, 'Verily,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor him is a narrow life and We will resurrect him blind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the Day of Resurrection'.'' Qur'an 20.124\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSamura ibn Jundub reported, \"The Prophet, peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, after the prayers would turn toward us and ask us,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Did any one of you have a dream?' If someone had, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould relate it. Upon hearing it the Prophet, peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, would say, 'Whatsoever Allah wills (is done).'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOne day he questioned us saying, 'Did anyone of you have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta dream?' They answered, 'No.' Then the Prophet, peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, said, 'But I saw tonight two men. They came to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tme. They held my hand and took me to the holy land. We\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame across a man Iying down, and behold, another man was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstanding over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas throwing the rock at the man's head, crushing it. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trock rolled away and the thrower followed it and brought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit back. By the time he reached the man, his head was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trestored to its normal state. The thrower then did the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame as he had done before. I asked my two companions,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Who are these two people?\" They said, \"Proceed!\" So we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproceeded and came to a man lying flat on his back and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother man standing over his head with an iron hook.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBehold, he would put the hook in one side of the man's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmouth and tear off that side of his face to the back of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe neck and similarly tear his nose from front to back\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother side of the man's face and did just as he had done\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the other side. As soon as he tore one side, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother side returned to its normal state. Then he returned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanions, \"Who are these two people?\" They said to me,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Proceed!\" So we proceeded and saw a hole like an oven,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnarrow at the top and wide at the bottom, and fire\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tburning in it. In that oven there were naked men and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen, and behold, flames of fire were reaching them from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderneath, and when it reached them, they would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\traised high until they were close to the mouth of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toven. Then the fire subsided and they went back inside it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagain. I asked, \"Who are these?\" They said to me,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Proceed!\" And so we proceeded and came to a river of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblood. And behold, in the middle of the river was a man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstanding, and on the bank there was one who had many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstones. The man who was in the river would try to leave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut the other man would throw rocks into his mouth so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he would return to where he was. Every time the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformer tried to leave, the other would throw rocks into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this mouth. Then he would return to where he was. I asked,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Who are these people?\" They replied, \"Proceed! Proceed!\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWe proceeded until we came to a man with a repulsive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappearance, the most repulsive appearance you ever saw in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta man! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand running around it. I asked my companions, \"Who is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis (man)?\" They said to me, \"Proceed! Proceed!\" So we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproceeded until we reached a garden of deep green dense\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvegetation, bedecked with all sorts of spring colors. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe middle of the garden there was a very tall man. I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould hardly see his head because of his great height.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd around him there were more children than I had ever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseen before. I said to my companions, \"Who is this?\" They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied, \"Proceed! Proceed!\" So we proceeded until we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame to a huge majestic garden, greater and better than I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave ever seen! My two companions said to me, \"Go up,\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand I went up.'\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Prophet, peace be upon him, added, 'So we ascended\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuntil we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWe went to its gate and asked the gatekeeper to open the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgate. It was opened and we entered the city. There we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfound men with one side of their bodies as handsome as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe most handsome person you have ever seen, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseen. My two companions ordered those men to throw\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves into the river. Behold, there was a river\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflowing through the city, and its water was as white as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmilk. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturned to us after the ugliness of their bodies had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisappeared and they turned in the best shape.' I said to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem, \"I have seen many wonders tonight. What is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaning of all that I have seen?\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey replied, \"We will inform you. As for the first man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou came upon whose head was being crushed with the rock,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the is the symbol of the one who studies the Qur'an and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen neither recites it nor acts on it, and sleeps,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneglects the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon whose mouth, nostrils, and eyes were torn off from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfront to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his house in the morning and tells so many lies that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit spreads all over the world. And those naked men and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen whom you saw in the oven, they are the adulterers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the adulteresses, and the man whom you saw in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\triver of blood is the usurer. As for the man by the base\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the tree, he was Abraham. As for the children around\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, they are the children of the people. (The narrator\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadded, \"Some Muslims asked the Prophet. peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, 'O Messenger of Allah! What about the children of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpagans?'

    "text": "<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn al-Qayyim dealt with this subject under a separate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchapter in which he mentions opinions of various scholars\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerning the abode of souls. Mentioning the most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorrect position he explained, \"It is said that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabodes of the souls in barzakh vary considerably. Some of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem are in the highest reaches of the heavens, such as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe souls of the Prophets, peace be upon them all. Their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatus also varies as observed by the Prophet, peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, during the night of Isra.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSome souls are in the form of green birds who roam around\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfreely in Paradise. These are the souls of some of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmartyrs, but not all of them. The souls of some martyrs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare prevented from entering Paradise on account of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdebts or some other similar thing. This is supported by a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treport by Ibn Hanbal in his Musnad from Muhammad ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdallah ibn Jahsh that \"A man came to the Prophet, peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe upon him, and asked, 'O Allah's Prophet! What would I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave if I am killed in the cause of Allah?' The Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace be upon him, replied, 'Paradise.'  But, when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman got up to go, the Prophet added, 'Unless you have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome debts to pay. Gabriel has informed me about it just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnow'.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSome souls will be locked out at the gate of Paradise, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccordance with this hadith: \"I have seen your companion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlocked out at the gate of Paradise.\" Other souls are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trestricted to their graves as is evident from the hadith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout the martyr who had stolen a cloak (He had stolen it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout of the spoils of war before their proper\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistribution) when he was killed, the people asked, \"Will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the have bliss in Paradise?\" The Prophet, peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, said, \"By Him in whose hand is my soul, the cloak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich he stole causes a fire to flare over him in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrave.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe abode of others is at the gate of Paradise, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescribed in a hadith by Ibn 'Abbas that, \"The abode of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmartyrs is in a green dome, on a bright river, near the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgate of Paradise. Their provision comes from Paradise in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe morning and in the evening.''  (Ahmad) This does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapply to Ja'far ibn Abi Talib, whose hands were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttransformed into wings, and with these he flies wherever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the wishes in Paradise.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOthers remain confined to earth, for these souls cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trise to heaven. Indeed, these are base, earthly souls\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich do not mix with the heavenly souls, just as they do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot mix with them during their sojourn on earth. A soul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat is oblivious to its Lord, blind to His love,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnegligent of His remembrance, and remiss in seeking His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpleasure is a despicable earthly soul. After separation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom its body, it cannot go anywhere, but remains here.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the other hand, the heavenly soul in this life clings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the love of Allah and to His remembrance, and seeks\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis pleasure and nearness. After separation from its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbody, it will join other kindred heavenly souls. In the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbarzakh (Literally an interval, a separation or a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpartition, Al-barzakh may be defined as the intervening\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate between death and the Last Day) and on the Day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tResurrection a person will be with those he loved. Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill join some souls with others in the abode of barzakh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand on the Day of Resurrection, placing the believer's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsoul with other pure souls, that is, other pure souls\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkindred to his soul. A soul, after separation from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbody, joins other kindred souls who in their nature and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeeds are similar to it and stays with them.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSome souls would be thrown in an oven or a pit along with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother fornicators and harlots. Other souls would be in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\triver of blood, floating therein and swallowing rocks.The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo categories of souls - the blessed and the damned - do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot share a similar abode, for there are souls that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treside in the highest reaches of heavens, while the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers, low and mean earthly souls, cannot rise above the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearth.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen one ponders the hadith and traditions on this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubject carefully, one can easily find the reason for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis. There is no contradiction in the sound traditions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton this subject. In fact, they are all true and each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupports the other. It is important, however, to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstand the soul and to appreciate its essence and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlaws that govern its functions. Indeed, the soul is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething completely different from the body. It is in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tParadise, but at the same time is attached to the grave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the body in it. It is the swiftest thing in moving,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelocating, ascending, or descending from one place to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother.These souls are divided into various categories:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe ones that are free to move about, those that are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfined, the ones that are celestial, and the others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat are earthly and of a low order. After separation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom their bodies, souls do experience health and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsickness, and they feel far more pleasure and pain than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey experienced when they were joined together.They are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubject to confinement, pain, punishment, sickness, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrief as they are to various states of joy, rest, bliss,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand freedom. How similar is its condition in the body to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen it was in the womb of its mother! And likewise how\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanalogous is its situation after separation from the body\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto when it came out of the womb into this world! There\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare four abodes of the soul, and each abode is bigger and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreater than the previous one.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe soul's first abode is the womb of the mother, where\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is confinement, compression, seclusion, and three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlayers of darkness.The second abode is its earthly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thabitat where it grows, does good and evil, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccumulates blessings for its ultimate success or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfailure. Its third abode is the abode of barzakh, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis more spacious and immense than the abode of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld. This abode, compared to the fourth one, is like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis [third] abode compared to the first abode.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe fourth abode is the abode of eternity, either\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tParadise or Hell. There is no other abode after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese.Allah causes the soul to pass through these abodes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin stages, until it reaches the abode most suitable for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit, an abode that only it deserves and for which it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[uniquely] suitable, because this abode was created for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit, and the soul was given the ability to perform the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeeds that lead precisely to this abode.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn each abode the soul enjoys a peculiar status and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tposition altogether different from what it has in other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabodes. Blessed indeed is soul's Originator and Creator,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWho gives it life, causes it to die, makes it happy or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubjects it grief and sorrow. Blessed is He Who appointed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor it various levels of success and failure, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistinguished them by various grades in accordance with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir knowledge, performance, faculties, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmorality.Whoever truly understands and appreciates this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot, but bear witness to the fact that there is no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeity except Allah, Who has no partners. With Him alone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trests all authority, praise, and all that is good, and to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHim alone all affairs return for decision. His is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsolute authority, and all dominion, might, honor,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twisdom, and perfection free of any defects or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timperfections. He is known through the testimony of His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruthful Prophets and Messengers. They did indeed come\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith Truth. Reason testifies to its truthfulness, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnature supports and confirms it. And anything that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontradicts this testimony is untrue.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

The Qur'an says, \"And\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablish regular prayer, for prayer restrains from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshameful and unjust deeds, and remembrance of Allah is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe greatest thing in life, without doubt.'' Qur'an 29.45\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn other words, the remembrance of Allah has a greater\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timpact in restraining one from shameful and unjust deeds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan just the formal regular prayer. This is so because\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen a servant opens up his soul to his Lord, extolling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis praise, Allah strengthens him with His light,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincreasing thereby his faith and conviction, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treassuring his mind and heart. This refers to \"those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremembrance of Allah, for without doubt in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremembrance of Allah do hearts find satisfaction.''\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an 13.28\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd when hearts are satisfied with the Truth, they turn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the highest ideals without being deflected by impulses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof desire or lust.

Obviously it would be unreasonable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto expect these results just by uttering certain words,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor words of the tongue unsupported by a willing heart\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare of no consequence. Allah Himself has taught us the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanner in which a person should remember Him, saying,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"And do bring your Lord to remembrance in your very soul,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith humility and in reverence, without loudness in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords, in the mornings and evening, and be not of those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho are unheedful.'' Qur'an 7.205\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis verse indicates that doing dhikr in silence and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout raising one's voice is better. Once during a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjourney the Prophet, peace be upon him, heard a group of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims supplicating aloud. Thereupon the Prophet, peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe upon him, said, \"Give yourselves a respite, you are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot calling upon someone deaf or absent. Surely He Whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou are calling upon is near you and He listens to all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe is nearer to you than the neck of your mount.\" This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith underlines the love and awe a person should feel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhile engaged in dhikr.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA part of this etiquette is the requirement that a person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twishing to do dhikr be clean in body and dress, and smell\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsweet and fragrant.

(A hadith reported from a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanion through words or acts uninterruptedly or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\totherwise) They all prove that the ability to arrange\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone's provisions and possession of means of journey is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary prerequisite for Hajj, and this despite the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) knew that many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the people (in his time) were able to go for Hajj on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfoot.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSimilarly the words of Allah: \"Pilgrimage thereto is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduty men owe to Allah - those who can afford the journey\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderline the fact that ability and power are the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary prerequisite for all forms of worship. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsignifies the unspecified power or a little bit more than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat may be necessary. In the case of sawm (fasting) and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsalah (obligatory prayers) the financial ability is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuperfluous and is not specified in the Qur'an, unlike\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj for which it is an important requirement. Similarly,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj is a form of worship which involves traveling for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich one must be in possession of sufficient means to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupport oneself (and one' s family), as well as be able\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto shoulder the cost of the journey as in jihad.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this regard we may refer to the Qur'anic verse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(9.91-92) \"Nor is there any blame on those who find no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresources to spend, nor is there (blame) on those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcome to you to be provided with mounts, and when you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'I can find no mounts for you,.\"'\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Al-Muhadhib we read: \"If someone has the money to buy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovisions and the passage to Hajj but he needs it to pay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this debts, Hajj is not binding on him, whether the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettlement of the debt is required immediately or is due\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter a time. The debts that are due for immediate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettlement must be paid at once, whereas the Hajj may be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformed later on in life. But if he spends all that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas on Hajj he may not be in a position to pay off his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdebt.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSimilarly, if one is in need of a dwelling or a servant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto help him, he may be classified as unable to perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj. Likewise, if one needs to take a wife because he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfears he may not be able to avoid evil, he must get\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarried, for it is his immediate need. Furthermore, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone needs goods for his business to obtain requisite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresources therefrom, such a one, according to Abul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abbas, Ibn Sarih, may be classified as unable to perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj in view of his specific need. Al-Mughni says: \"If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe debt is owed to a wealthy person who does not demand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timmediate settlement of the loan, defers settlement to a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlater stage, and is ready to permit the debtor to proceed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor Hajj, then such a debtor is (technically) able to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperform Hajj. But in case the lender cannot afford to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefer settlement of the loan, the debtor would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treckoned as unable to perform Hajj.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to the Shafi'i school: \"If someone offers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother a free passage for Hajj, one is not obliged to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept the offer, for it is a favor and involves distress\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof being obliged to another person. If, however, such an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffer is made by one' s son to perform Hajj, then one is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligated to do so, for one can perform it without being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeholden to anyone else.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Hanbali school is of the view that an offer of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfinancial help by someone else does not obligate a person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto perform Hajj, nor does this classify him as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(financially) capable of performing it, whether the offer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomes from a stranger or a relative and whether the offer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovides means of travel and provision, or linanacial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelp as such.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim reports: \"Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaibah and Ishaq bin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbrahim told us that Hatem bin Isma'il al-Madani reported\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Ja'far bin Mohammad and he of his father, saying, 'We\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvisited Jabir bin Abdullah (he was blind) and he began\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinquiring about the people (who had come to see him) till\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit was my turn. I said: \"I am Mohammad ibn Ali ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHussein.\" He placed his hand on my head and opened my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupper button and then the lower one, and then placed his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thand on my chest (in order to bless me). I was during\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose days a young boy, and then he said: \"You are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twelcome, my nephew. Ask whatever you want to ask.\" I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked him a question but it was time for prayer. He stood\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tup covering himself in his mantle. Whenever he placed its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tends upon his shoulders they slipped down because it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshort (in size). Another mantle was, however, Iying on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe clothes rack nearby (and he put it on) and led the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayer. I said to him: \"Tell me about the Hajj of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (peace be upon him).\" He held up his nine fingers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand said: \"The Prophet (peace be upon him) stayed in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah for nine years but did not perform Hajj. Then, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe tenth year he made a public announcement to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teffect that Allah's Messenger was about to perform the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj. A large number of people came to Madinah, and all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof them were eager to emulate the Prophet (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim) and follow his actions.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"We set out with him until we reached Dhul-Hulaifah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhere Asma bint 'Umais gave birth to Mohammad ibn Abi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBakr. She sent a message to the Prophet (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim) asking him: \"What should I do?\" He said, \"Take a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbath, bandage your private parts and put on ihram.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Prophet (peace be upon him) then prayed in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmosque and then mounted al-Qaswa (his she-camel) and it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstood erect with him on its back at al-Baida. As far as I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould see in front of me, behind me, on my right and on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmy left, I saw riders and pedestrians. The Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah (peace be him) was prominent among us and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(revelation) of the Qur'an was descending upon him, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is he who knows (its true) interpretation. Whatever he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid, we also did.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe pronounced the Oneness of Allah (saying): Labbaika\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllahumma labbaik labbaika la sharika laka labbaik, innal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thamda wan-ni'mata laka wal mulk, la sharika lak (O Allah!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI hasten to You. You have no partner. I hasten to You.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAll praise and grace is Thine and the Sovereignty too;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYou have no partner). And the people also pronounced this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttalbiyah which they pronounce today. The Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah (peace be upon him) did not disapprove of anything\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin it, but he adhered to his own talbiyah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJabir said: \"We did not have any other intention but that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Hajj only, being unaware of the 'Umrah, but when we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame with him to the House (of Allah), he touched the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBlack Stone (Hajar al Aswad) and made seven circuits,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trunning three of them and walking four. Then going to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tStation of Ibrahim, he recited: \"And adopt the Station of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbrahim as a place of prayer.'' (Qur'an 2.125) He stood\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat a place where the Station (of Ibrahim) was between him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the House. There he prayed two rak'ahs reciting Surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-lkhlas, and Surah Al-Kafirun. He then returned to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBlack Stone (Hajar al A.sl~ad) and kissed it. Then he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twent out of the gate to Safa, and as he approached it he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecited: \"Al-Safa and al-Marwah are among the signs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappointed by Allah,\" (Qur'an 2.15) (adding:) I begin with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat Allah began. He first mounted Safa until he saw the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHouse, and facing Qiblah he declared the Oneness of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand glorified Him and said: La ilaha illa Allah wahdahu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tla sharika lahu, lahul mulk wa lahul hamd, wa huwa 'ala\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkulli sha'in qadeer, la ilaha illallahu wahdahu anjaza\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twa'dahu, wa nasara 'abdahu, wa hazamal ahzaba wahdah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(There is no God but Allah, One, He has no partner. His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the Sovereignty, to Him praise is due, and He is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPowerful over everything. There is no God but Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talone, Who fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trouted the confederates alone\").\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe said these words three times making supplications in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween. He then descended and walked towards Marwah, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen his feet touched the bottom of the valley, he ran;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand when he began to ascend, he walked till he reached\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMarwah. There he did as he had done at Safa.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"When it was his last round of Marwah he said: 'If I had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknown beforehand what I have come to know afterwards, I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould not have brought sacrificial animals and would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffered it as an 'Umrah. So, he among you who has not the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrificial animals with him should put off ihram and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreat it as an 'Umrah. Suraqa ibn Malik ibn Ju'tham got\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tup and said, 'Messenger of Allah, does it apply to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresent year, or does it apply forever? Thereupon the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah (peace be upon him) intertwined the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfingers (of one hand) into another and said twice: 'The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Umrah has become incorporated in the Hajj,' (adding):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'No, but forever and ever.'\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Ali came from Yemen with the sacrificial animals for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (peace be upon him) and found Fatimah (Allah be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpleased with her) to be one among those who had put olf\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tihram. put on dyed clothes, and had applied kuhl*. Ali\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshowed diiapproval of it, whereupon she said: 'My father\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas commanded me to do this.' (The narrator) said that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAli used to say in Iraq: 'I went to the Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah (peace be upon him) showing annoyance at Fatimah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor what she had done, and asked the Prophet (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him) regarding what she had narrated from him, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttold him that he was angry with her, whereupon the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (peace be upon him) said: 'She has told the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruth; she has told the truth.'\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"(The Prophet then asked Ali): 'What did you say when you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tput on ihram?' I (Ali) said: 'O Allah, I am putting on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tihram for the same purpose as Your Messenger has put it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton.' Thereupon the Prophet (peace be upon him) told him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'I have with me sacrificial animals, so do not put off\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe ihram.'\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"(Jabir) said: 'The total number of those sacrificial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanimals brought by Ali from Yemen and of those brought by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet (peace be upon him) was one hundred. All the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople except the Prophet (peace be upon him) and those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho had with them sacrificial animals, put off ihram and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgot their hair clipped. When it was the day of Tarwiya\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(8th of Dhul-Hijjah) they went to Mina and put on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tihram for Hajj and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim) rode and led there, the noon, afternoon, sunset,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Isha and dawn prayers. He then waited a little till the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsun rose, and commanded that a tent of hair should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpitched at Namira.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) then set out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Quraish did not doubt that he would halt at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Mash'ar Al-Haram (the sacred site) as the Quraish used\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto do in the pre-Islamic period. The Messenger of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him), however, passed on till he came to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Arafah and he found that the tent had been pitched for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim at Namira. There he got down till the sun had passed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe meridian; he commanded that al-Qaswa be brought and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaddled for him. Then he came to the bottom of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvalley, and addressed the people saying: Verily your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblood, your property are as sacred and inviolable as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacredness of this day of yours, in this month of yours,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin this town of yours.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBehold! Everything pertaining to the Days of Ignorance is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunder my feet, and completely abolished. Abolished are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso the blood-revenges of the Days of Ignorance. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst claim of ours on blood-revenge which I abolish is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat of the son of Rabi 'a ibn al-Harith, who was nursed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the tribe of Sa'd and killed by Hudhail. And the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tusury of the pre-Islamic period is abolished, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst of our usury I abolish is that of 'Abbas ibn 'Abd\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Muttalib, for it is all abolished.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFear Allah concerning women! Verily you have taken them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the security of Allah, and intercourse with them has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen made lawful unto you by word of Allah. You too have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trights over them, in that they should not allow anyone to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsit on your bed whom you do not like. But if they do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat, you can chastise them but not severely. Their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trights upon you are that you should provide them with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfood and clothing in a fitting manner.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI have left among you the Book of Allah, and if you hold\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfast to it, you will never go astray. And you will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked about me (on the Day of Resurrection), (now tell\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tme) what would you say? They (the audience) said: \"We\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill bear witness that you have conveyed (the message),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdischarged (the ministry of Prophethood) and given wise\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(sincere) counsel.\" He (the narrator) said: \"He (the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet) then raised his forefinger towards the sky and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpointing it at the people (said): 'O Allah, be witness. O\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah be witness,' saying it thrice' .\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Then adhan was pronounced and later on iqama and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (peace be upon him) led the noon prayer. Then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother Iqama was pronounced and the Prophet (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him) led the afternoon prayer and he observed no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother prayer in between the two. (This proves the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvalidity of joining Zuhr and 'Asr prayer on this day, at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis place. There is consensus on it, but there is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisagreement as to its cause. Abu Hanifah and some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tShafi'i scholars hold that it is a part of Hajj, but the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmajority of Shafi+i scholars hold it is due to journey)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) then mounted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this camel and came to the place where he was to stay. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade his she-camel, al-Qaswa, turn towards the rocky\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tside, with the pedestrian path Iying in front of him. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaced the Qiblah, and stood there until the sun set, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe yellow light diminished somewhat, and the disc of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsun totally disappeared. He made Usama sit behind him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand pulled the nosestring of Qaswa so forcefully that its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thead touched the saddle (in order to keep her under\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperfect control), and pointing out with his right hand,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadvised the people to be moderate (in speed) saying: \"O\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople! calmness, calmness!\" Whenever he passed over an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\televated tract of land, he slightly loosened the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnose-string of his camel till she climbed up. This is how\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the reached al-Muzdalifah.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"There he led the evening and 'Isha prayers with one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadhan and two iqamas and did not glorify (Allah) in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween them (i.e. he did not observe supererogatory rak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'ahs between Maghrib and 'Isha prayers). The Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah (peace be upon him) then lay down til1 dawn and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffered the dawn prayer with an adhan and iqama when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmorning light was clear. He again mounted al-Qaswa, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen he came to Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram, he faced Qiblah, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupplicated to Allah, Glorified Him, and pronounced His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUniqueness and Oneness, and kept standing till the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdaylight was very clear.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"He then went quickly before the sun rose, and seated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehind him was Al-Fadl ibn 'Abbas, who wa.s a man with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeautiful hair, fair complexion, and handsome face. As\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) moved on, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgroup of women riding camels was also passing. Al-Fadl\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegan to look at them. The Messenger of Allah (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him) placed his hand on Al-Fadl's face who then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tturned his face to the other side, and began to look, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) turned his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thand to the other side and placed it on Al-Fadl's face.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe again turned his face to the other side till he came\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the bottom of Muhassir. He urged her (al-Qaswa) a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlittle, and, following the middle road, (This proves that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is sunnah to follow a different road on the way back\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Arafah than the one taken while going toward it. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (peace be upon him) went by the Dab road to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArafah. Similarly he used to take different routes going\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto or coming back from 'Eid prayers) which comes out at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe greatest Jamarah, he came to the Jamarah which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnear the tree. At this he threw seven small pebbles,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying, 'Allahu Akbar' while throwing every one of them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin a manner in which the small pebbles are thrown\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(holding them with fingers) and this he did while at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbottom of the valley. (That is, he stood there at a place\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhere Mina, Arafah and Al-Muzdalifah were on his right,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Makkah on his left side)\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"He then went to the place of sacrifice, and sacrificed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsixty-three (camels) with his own hand. He shared the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremaining camels with Ali, who sacrificed them. He then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommanded that a piece of meat from each sacrificed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanimal be put in a pot. When it was cooked, both of them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(the Prophet and Ali) ate some of it and drank its soup.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) again rode\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand came to the House (of Allah), where he performed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTawaf Al-Ifadah and oftered the Zuhr prayer at Makkah. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame to the tribe of 'Abd al-Muttalib, who were supplying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twater at Zamzam, and said: 'Draw water, O Banu 'Abd\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Muttalib; were it not that people would usurp this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright of supplying water from you, I would have drawn it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talong with you.' So they handed him a bucket and he drank\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe scholars said: \"This hadith is one of its kind. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontains lots of valuable information.\" Al-Qadi 'Iyad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: \"Many scholars have spoken (and written) at great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlength about the legal injunctions contained in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith.\" Abu Bakr ibn Al-Mundhir has listed a large part\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof these identifying about one hundred and fifty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinjuctions. He observes that if he had analysed more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclosely this number would almost double.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe scholars said: This hadith indicates that for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen giving birth to a child or having monthly periods\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is sunnah - and much more so for others - to take a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbath when they intend to perform Hajj or 'Umrah. It also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteaches us that the women who are menstruating or are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstill in their confinement after childbirth, should clean\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves properly, cover their private parts with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpiece of cotton, then declare their ihram. It also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindicates that ihram must be declared after offering\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teither a fard or a supererogatory prayer. After declaring\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tihram one should utter talbiyah loudly and preferably use\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same words as used by the Prophet (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim). However, there is no harm in adding similar phrases\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas 'Umar did: \"O Allah! I answer Your call, You Who gives\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessings and good favors. I answer Your call fearing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYou, and wishing Your favor.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis hadith also indicates that a pilgrim must first come\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Makkah where one must perform circumambulation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarrival in Makkah (Tawaf qudoom), and touch the Black\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tStone--if possible--and make the first three rounds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trunning, while making the other four walking at normal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspeed. The running is done around the Ka'bah except\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter making the Tawaf one must go to the Station of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbrahim (peace be upon him) and recite the verse: \"Take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Station of Ibrahim as a place for prayer.\" Then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstanding there, with the Station of Ibrahim between him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Ka'bah, he should pray two rak'ahs reciting after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Fatihah, Surah Al-Kafirun in the first rak'ah, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Al-lkhlas in the second rak'ah. This hadith also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindicates that touching the Black Stone again prior to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleaving the Sacred Mosque is recommended (if possible),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjust as one did upon entering it. There is consensus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the scholars that touching (kissing) the Black\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tStone is sunnah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter that, one must make Sa'i and for this purpose go to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmount Safa. climb it, face the Ka'bah and make\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupplications three times to Allah. Then. one must climb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown and walk toward Marwah, while jogging in the marked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarea called bainal milain between Safa and Marwah every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime one passes this area during the seven rounds not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjust in the first three rounds as in Tawaf. On reaching\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMarwah one should climb it just as one climbed Safa, make\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupplications, and make remembrance.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompletion of all these rites will complete one's 'Umrah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow one should either shave one's head or clip some of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone's hair to get out of the state of ihram. This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprecisely what the Companions of the Prophet (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him) did when the Prophet (peace be upon him)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommanded them to change their Hajj to 'Umrah. As for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpilgrim who is combining Hajj and 'Umrah, he must not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshave or clip his hair, but should remain in his state of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tihram.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the 8th of Dhul-Hij jah. those who had put off their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tihram after making 'Umrah, should again put on ihra77l to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperform pilgrimage, and then head to Mina with those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcombine Hajj and 'Umrah. It is sunnah to offer the five\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdaily prayers in Mina and to spend the night of the 9th\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Dhul-Hijjah there.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is also sunnah not to leave Mina for 'Arafah until\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the sunrise, and not to enter 'Arafah until the sun\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegins to decline, and after ot'fering both Zuhr and 'Asr\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayers, which the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNamira which is not a part of 'Arafah. The Prophet (peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe upon him) did not enter his quarters at 'Arafah until\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter otfering Zuhr and 'Asr prayers. Moreover, it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) to offer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome supererogatory (nawafil) prayers in between these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo prayers.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe imam should give a sermon before the prayer, which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone of the sunnah sermons in pilgrimage. The second\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsermon is given by the imam on the 7th of Dhul-Hijjah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter Zuhr prayer in the Ka'bah.

They differ about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe month of Dhul-Hijjah, whether only the first ten days\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof it are included in the months of Hajj or the entire\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmonth.

'Ata said, \"I heard Jabir ibn Abdullah saying,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'We (the Companions) declared our intention to perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj only. On the 4th of Dhul-Hijjah the Prophet (peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe upon him) commanded us to terminate our state of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tihram, saying, \"Terminate your state of ihram and go to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour wives.\" He did not, however, oblige us to do so but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the permitted us. We said: 'There are only five days left\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Day of 'Arafah. Shall we go to 'Arafah while semen\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis dribbling from our male organs?\" The Prophet (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him) stood up and said: \"You know that I fear Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe most, and that I am the most truthful, and the most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpious amongst you. If I had not brought my sacrificial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanimals with me, I also would have terminated my state of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tihram. If I were to again come (to Makkah), I shall not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbring the sacrificial animals with me. So terminate your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate of ihram.\" At this we terminated our state of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tihram; we listened to and obeyed (the Prophet).\" This was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treported by Muslim.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn 'Abbas was once asked about the break between 'Umrah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Hajj to which he replied: \"The Muhajirun (immigrants\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Makkah), the Ansar (people of Madinah), and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twives of the Prophet (peace be upon him) declared their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintention to perform the Farewell Hajj. So we also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeclared our intention to do the same. Upon arrival in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Make your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeclaration of intention for 'Umrah only, except for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who have already designated their sacrificial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanimals, and brought them along with them.\" We made Tawaf\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Ka'bah, walked seven times between Safa and Marwah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen we consorted with our wives and wore our regular\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclothes. The Prophet (peace be upon him) further told us:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Those who have garlanded (i.e., marked) their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrificial animals, they must not break their state of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tihram until the animal reaches the slaughter house to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffered in sacrifice. Then we were commanded by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (peace be upon him) to declare our intention for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj on the night of the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah. After\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompleting all the rites of Hajj, we went and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcircumambulated around the Kabbah, walked between Safa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Marwah, and thus we completed Hajj and we offered the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrifice as Allah says, \"If anyone wishes to continue\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe 'Umrah onto the Hajj, he must make an offering such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, he should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfast three days during the Hajj and seven days on his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn ... (to his country).\" (Qur'an 2.196) Offering a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsheep in sacrifice is enough for this purpose. These\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) combined\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo worships in one year: Hajj and 'Umrah. Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned it in His Book and (reinforced it) by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice of His Prophet (peace be upon him), making it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermissible for all people, excepting the residents of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah. Allah says (Qur'an 2.136): \"This is for those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhose household is not in (the precincts of) the Sacred\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMosque.\" The Hajj months referred to are Shawwal,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDhul-Qui'dah and DhulHijjah. So whosoever combines an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Umrah and Hajj during these months has to offer a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrifice, or observe fast. This is reported by Bukhari.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis hadith proves that the residents of Makkah can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneither perform qiran nor tamattu'. They may perform if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trad only--a single Hajj or a single 'Umrah. This is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topinion of Ibn 'Abbas, and Abu Hanifah in the light of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah' s words, \"This is for those whose household is (in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe precincts of) the Sacred Mosque.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere is disagreement among scholars concerning \"those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhose household is (in the precincts) of the Sacred\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMosque.\" Malik holds that they are the people of Makkah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-A'raj agrees with this view and also At-Tahawi who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreferred this view. Ibn 'Abbas, Taw'us, and another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgroup are of the opinion that it is the people living\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithin the sacred precincts of Haram, which according to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Hafiz, is quite apparent. Ash-Shafi'i holds that any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone living around Makkah at a distance not more than that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat which one is permitted to shorten regular prayers is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresident of Makkah. Ibn Jarir agrees and prefers this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tview. The Hanafi scholars hold that all those living\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithin or at the miqat are residents of Makkah. In this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregard, the place of residence and not the place of birth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof a person is taken into account.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe above hadith also indicates that a person who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperforms Hajj tamattu' must first make a tawaf of Ka'bah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Sa'i between Safa and Marwah. This will suffice him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor tawaful qudum (circumambulation of arrival) which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformed as a greeting to the Sacred Mosque upon arrival\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere. Then, after the Day of 'Arafah, such a person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshall make another tawaf, tawaf ifada. and perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother Sa'i between Safa and Marwah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs for the qarin, the pilgrim who combines 'Umrah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj and remains in a state of ihram after the first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Umrah, the scholars are of the opinion that he needs to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperform only one tawaf (seven circumambulations around\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKa'bah) and one Sa'i (seven rounds between Safa and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMarwah) for both the Hajj and 'Umrah. The case of such a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson is very much similar to the pilgrim who performs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tifrad (Hajj only).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><ul><li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJabir reported: \"The Prophet (peace be upon him)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcombined Hajj and 'Umrah, with one tawaf.\" This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tis transmitted by Tirmidhi, who considers it a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsound hadith.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li><li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn 'Umar reported that the Prophet (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him) said: \"He who declared his intention to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tperform Hajj and 'Umrah together, may perform one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttawafand one Sa'i for them.\" This is reported by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTirmidhi, with the remarks that this is a hasan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgharib hadith. Ad-Daraqutni has also reported it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbut he adds: \"One must not terminate one's state\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof ihram until one has completed both (the Hajj\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tas well as 'Umrah).\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li><li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Prophet (peace be upon him) told 'Aishah:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Your tawaf of the Ka'bah and Sa'i between Safa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Marwah will suffice you for both Hajj and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t'Umrah.\" This is reported by Muslim.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li></ul><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Hanifah, however, is of the view that in such a case\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(i.e., combining Hajj and 'Umrah) lawaf and Sa'i must be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformed twice.

Ibn Qudamah said: \"There is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagreement on the permissibility of using herbs, flowers,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrass and tender plants grown by men within the sacred\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprecincts of Haram.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe author of Al Rawdah al-Nadiyyah says: \"The dwellers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Haram, who are not in the state of ihram, incur\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsin, but no penalty for killing a game or cutting a tree\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithin the Sacred Precincts.\" As for those who are in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate of ihram, they must pay the penalty prescribed by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah for killing a game. But for cutting a tree in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah they incur no penalty, because the evidence in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis regard is not strong enough. The hadith which states\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"If one cuts a big tree, he must slaughter a cow in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompensation\" is not a sound hadith. What is related from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearlier scholars and their opinions on this issue, cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe taken as conclusive by themselves.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe author continues: \"In short, there is no connection\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween prohibition of killing game and cutting trees,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the obligation of paying a penalty or giving away an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamount of equivalent value in atonement. Prohibition,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, is clear from what is forbidden. The penalty or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tequivalent value can be applied only when there is clear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevidence to establish it. But the only evidence we have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin this matter is the words of Allah \"...Kill no game\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhile in the Sacred Precincts or in pilgrim garb...\" In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis verse only penalty is mentioned; nothing else is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tessential (wajib).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

Atter completing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(seven rounds of) the tawafthe pilgrim should go to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tStation of Ibrahim in compliance with the command of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah \"And take the Station of Ibrahim as a place of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayer.\" (Qur'an 2.125) There he should pray two rak'ahs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof tawaf.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow he should go to the well of Zamzam and drink of its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twater as much as possible.

After\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis he should climb down and start walking toward the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(hill of) Al-Marwah as a start of his seven round walk\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween the two hills, while remembering Allah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupplicating to Him.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn approaching one of the two green markers, he should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjog to the second green marker.

He should perform it in the same manner as he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad earlier performed Tawaf Al-Qudum. If the pilgrim is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperforming Hajj Tamattu', he must perform a Sa'i after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Tawaf Al-Ifadah. For a pilgrim performing Hajj Qiran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor Ifrad, this second Sa'i is not essential, if on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarriving in Makkah he had performed a Tawaf Al-Qudum.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this tawaf - Tawaf-Al-Ifadah - a pilgrim may engage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin all normal lawful activities including sexual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercourse with his wife.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe pilgrim must now return to Mina and stay overnight\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere.

Then he should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgo to the last Jamarah, throw pebbles at it, and leave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout stopping there. A pilgrim should finish throwing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpebbles at the three Jamarahs well before the sunset. On\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe 12th of Dhul-Hijjah he should repeat the rites of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevious day.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHaving thrown the pebbles a pilgrim is free either to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn to Makkah before the sunset of the 12th of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDhul-Hijjah, or spend the 13th of Dhul-Hijjah as well in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMina, and throw pebbles at the Jamarahs.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThrowing pebbles is an essential rite of Hajj and for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfailing to do so one must offer a sacrifice.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter returning to Makkah if the pilgrim desires to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn to his home country he must perform TawafAI-Wida'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor Farewell Tawaf, which is also an essential rite of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj.

I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbear witness that you indeed delivered the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage (of Allah). discharged your trust,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcounseled the Muslim community, and strove hard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttor the cause of Allah.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li><li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNow moving about a yard to the right, the visitor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tshould offer his greetings to Abu Baker\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAs-Siddiq, and then moving further another yard\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin the same direction, offer greetings to 'Umar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbin Al-Khattab.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li><li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThen facing the direction of Qiblah the visitor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tshould supplicate for himself, his family,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfriends, relatives, and the rest of the Muslims,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand then leave.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li><li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA visitor should not raise his voice more than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tneeded to hear himself. The people in charge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tshould prevent others from raising their voices\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgently and politely.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li></ul><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is reported that 'Umar bin Al-Khattab saw two men\\n\\t\\t\\t\\traising their voices in the Mosque of the Prophet (peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe upon him). At this he told them, \"Had I known that you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare from this city, I would have punished you.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Daw'ud reported from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him) said, \"Do not turn your houses into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgraves, nor make my grave a place of festivity. Send your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreetings upon me, for your greetings are conveyed to me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twherever you are.\" Abdullah bin Hasan saw a man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrequenting the grave of the Prophet (peace be upon him)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand making supplications there. Thereupon he told him, O,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso and so, the Prophet (peace be upon him) has said, 'Do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot make my grave a place of festivity. but send your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreetings upon me from wherever you happen to be, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour greetings are conveyed to me.' (In this respect)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is no difference between you and a man from (a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistant country like) Andalusia.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"
