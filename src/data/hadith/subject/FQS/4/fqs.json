Such a person may, likewise, be entrusted with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfunds or other financial transactions, for Allah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tExalted, says: 'Among the People of the Book are some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho, if entrusted with a hoard of gold, will (readily)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpay it back; others, who, if entrusted with a single\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsilver coin, will not repay it unless you constantly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstand over them demanding it'.'' (Qur'an 3.75)\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWe find in a sound hadith that the Prophet, peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, hired a polytheist as a guide at the time of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmigration to Madinah, so he entrusted him with his life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand money. The people of the tribe of Khuza'ah, who were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboth Muslims and non-Muslims, acted as scouts for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah, peace be upon him. It is also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treported that the Prophet, peace be upon him, ordered\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims to seek treatment from Al-Harith ibn Kaldah, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas a disbeliever. But when a Muslim physician with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpertise is available, one should seek his or her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreatment and not turn to anyone else. The same applies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen one has to entrust a person with funds or deal with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim in business. If a Muslim has to confide in or turn to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomeone from the people of the Book for medical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreatment, he may do so. It is not prohibited to befriend\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJews and Christians. And when the Muslim has an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topportunity to talk to them, he should address them in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tways that are polite and sincere. Indeed, Allah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tExalted, says: \"And do not argue with the people of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBook, except in ways that are best.\" Qur'an 29.46\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn a hadith on the Treaty of Hudaibiyah, Abu Al-Khattab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttells us that \"the Prophet, peace be upon him, sent a man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Khuza'ah tribe to gather intelligence, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, peace be upon him, accepted his report despite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fact that he was a disbeliever.\" This proves,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to Abu Al-Khattab, that it is quite permissible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto take the advice of a non-believing physician for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiagnosis and treatment, provided he is not suspect and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this fidelity is not doubtful.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

This interpretation is supported by Ahmad,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho recorded in his Al-Musnad that Safwan states: \"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost eminent scholars say: 'The recitation of Surah Ya\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSin at the time of a person's death makes death easy for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim'. \"The compiler of Musnad al-Firdaus attributes this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith to Abu ad-Darda and Abu Dharr.

Similarly, when the Prophet died, Abu Bakr leaned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover him and kissed him between his eyes saying: \"O my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet!

This is based on a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treport, recorded by Abu Daw'ud from al-Husayn ibn Wujuh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat when Talhah ibn al-Bara fell ill, the Prophet, peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, said: \"I see that Talhah is on the verge of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath.

Ahmad and Tirmidhi report on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority of Ali ibn Abu Talib that the Prophet, peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, said: \"O Ali, never delay three things: prayer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen its time approaches, the funeral when death is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfirmed, and marrying a widow or a divorcee when a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuitable match is found for her.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis means that the judgement regarding a soul's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsalvation or perdition or its entry into Paradise is held\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin abeyance until its debts are fully paid off and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettled. This applies to a person who leaves some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty upon his death. His debt should be paid out of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe property that he leaves behind. In the case of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson who dies in debt which he sincerely intended to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpay, but has no property (nor leaves any behind to pay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this debt), according to a confirmed report, his debt will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe settled by Allah, the Exalted. Concerning a person who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdies in debt with sufficient means to pay it and was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twilling to do so, but his heirs do not pay it, Bukhari\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecords on the authority of Abu Hurayrah that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, peace be upon him, said: \"If anyone takes other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople's money with the intention to repay it and then he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor she should die without settling the debt, Allah will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpay the debt on his behalf.

Then he should begin by lightly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpressing the stomach of the deceased so as to expel, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible, any remnants from it, and then wash the body of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall impurities. The washer should use a wash cloth or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrap his or her hand with it, because touching the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprivate parts of the dead is haram (forbidden).

Then beginning from its right side, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbody should be washed with soap and water, three times.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf soap is not available, then washing with ordinary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twater will suffice. If the washer feels that three washes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare not enough to cleanse the body properly, then he may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twash it five or seven times.

If the deceased is a female, then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther hair should be loosened, washed, redone, and placed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehind her back. According to a hadith narrated by Umm\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Atiyyah the hair of the Prophet's daughter was done in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree plaits. I asked: 'Did they loosen her hair and then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tredo them in three braids?' She said: 'Yes'.\" Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treports this in these words: \"We braided her hair in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree braids, on both sides and in front (of her).\" In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Sahih, Ibn Hibban says: \"They did so in compliance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the order of the Prophet: 'Do her hair in three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplaits'.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter having washed the body, it should be dried with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclean cloth lest the shroud should get wet.

Even if a person were eaten by carnivorous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanimals or bumt to ashes and thrown into the air or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdrowned in the sea, he or she would be questioned about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this or her deeds, and rewarded with good or evil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdepending on his or her deeds in life. Both the body and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe soul together experience punishment or reward.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn al-Qayyim said, \"The early Muslim community and its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprominent scholars held that after death, a person is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teither in bliss or torment both physically and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspiritually. After its separation from the body, the soul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tendures a state of happiness or punishment. At times,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen the soul rejoins the body, both of them receive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttorture or joy. On the Day of Resurrection, the souls\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill be returned to the bodies and they will rise from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir graves and stand before the Lord of the worlds. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims, Christians, and Jews, all believe in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresurrection of the body.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Maruzi related that Imam Ahmad said, \"The punishment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the grave is a reality, and only he who is misguided\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor wants to misguide others denies it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHanbal said, \"I asked Abu Abdallah about the punishment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the grave. He said, 'These are the sound hadith and we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve in them and affirm them. We affirm everything\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat comes from the Prophet, peace be upon him, with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsound chain of narrators. If we were to confirm a report\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas being from the Prophet, peace be upon him, and then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treject it or oppose it, we would be denying the Word of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, \"Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it\".'  I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked him, 'Is the punishment of the grave a reality?' He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'Yes, it is a reality. The people are punished in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir graves. ' I heard Abu Abdallah saying, 'We believe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the punishment of the grave, in Munkar and Nakir (the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo questioning angels), and that the deceased will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestioned in their graves.' The Qur'an states that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Allah will establish in strength those who believe in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Word, that stands firm in this world and in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter,'  Qur'an 14.27 that is, in the grave.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad ibn al-Qasim said, I asked, 'O Abu Abdallah! Do you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve in Munkar andNakir and what is related conceming\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe punishment of the grave? ' He said, 'Glory to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah.Yes, we do confirm that and we declare so.'I said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'This expression that you use, is it Munkar and Nakir? Or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo you call them, \"The two angels?\"' He answered: 'Munkar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Nakir.'I said, 'They say, \"There is no mention of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMunkar and Nakir in the hadith\".' He replied, 'Of course\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is. There is Munkar and Nakir'.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Hafiz said in Al-Fath, \"Ahmad ibn Hazm and Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHubairah are of the opinion that the questioning is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taddressed to the soul only, without its returning to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbody. The majority of Muslim scholars, however, disagree\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith them. They say, 'The soul is returned to the body or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome of it, as is confirmed by the hadith. Had the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunishment been directed at the soul only, there would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot be concern for the body. The scattered parts of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbody should pose no problem, for Allah is able to give\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife to any part of a body, and then address the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestioning to that particular part. Likewise, He is able\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto gather all its parts easily'.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThose who hold that the questioning will be addressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly to the soul say that if one were to examine the body\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the grave at the time of the questioning, one will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnotice no trace of its sitting or any other movement.One\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill also notice that the grave is neither more narrow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnor spacious. Similar is the case of those who are not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tburied in any grave, e.g., the people who are crucified.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTo counter this objection, it is maintained that it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot impossible. Rather, in physical life we find a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimilar example, namely, sleeping. A sleeping person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texperiences both pleasure and pain, but his companion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot notice any of its effects on him. In fact, even a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson who is wide awake also feels pain and pleasure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen he hears or thinks of his painful or pleasant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texperiences, but its effects cannot be noticed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConsidering the unseen in the light of what is seen or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguessing about life after death in terms of the present\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife is the mistake of this fallacious thinking.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tObviously Allah has screened the sights and sounds of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother world from man, and with our limited physical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaculties, we are incapable of perceiving the vast\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkingdom of heavens, unless Allah wills it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe opinion of the majority in this respect is supported\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby various hadith. The Prophet, peace be upon him, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texample, told us, \"the deceased hears the sound of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfootsteps\"; \"his ribs are altered because of the embrace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the grave\"; \"the sound of his voice resounds when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tangel strikes him with a hammer\"; \"he is struck between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this ears,\" or \"they (the two angels) will cause him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsit up.\" All these hadith refer to various bodily\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions. We will mention here some of the sound hadith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerning this subject.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZaid ibn Thabit reported, \"The Prophet, peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, was going with us toward the dwellings of Banu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan-Najjar. He was riding a pony, which spooked and he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnearly fell off. He found four, five, or six graves\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere, and asked, 'Which of you knows about those lying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin these graves?' Someone said, ' I do . ' Thereupon the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, peace be upon him, asked, ' In what state did\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey die? ' He replied, 'They died as polytheists. ' He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"These people are passing through an ordeal in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgraves. You would stop burying your dead in the graves if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou heard the torment in the grave that I hear. If it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere not for this fact, I should have certainly made you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlisten to it.' Then turning his face toward us, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmonished, 'Seek refuge with Allah from the torment of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHell.' They replied, 'We seek refuge with Allah from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttorment of Hell.' He said, 'Seek refuge with Allah from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe torment of the grave.' They said, 'We seek refuge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith Allah from the torment of the grave. ' He warned,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Seek refuge with Allah from temptations both visible and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvisible.' They replied, 'We seek refuge with Allah from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttemptation (fitnah) in every visible and invisible form.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen he added, 'Seek refuge with Allah from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttemptation of the Dajjal.' They said, 'We seek refuge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith Allah from the temptation of the Dajjal'.'' \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Muslim)\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQatadah reported that Anas ibn Malik said, \"The Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace be upon him, said, 'When a human is laid in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrave and his companions return and he hears their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfootsteps, two angels will come to him and make him sit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand ask him, \"What did you say about this man, Muhammad,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmay peace be upon him?\" He will say, \"I testify that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis Allah's servant and His Messenger.\" Then it will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid to him, \"Look at your place in Hell-Fire. Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texchanged for you a place in Paradise instead of it\".'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Prophet, peace be upon him, added, 'The dead person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill see both his places. As for a non-believer or a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thypocrite, he will respond to the angels, \"I do not know,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut I used to say what the people used to say ! \" It will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe said to him, \"Neither did you know nor did you seek\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguidance from those who had knowledge.\" Then he will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thit with an iron hammer between his two ears, and he will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcry and that cry will be heard by all except human beings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand jinns'.\" (Bukhari and Muslim)\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Bara ibn 'Azib reported: The Prophet, peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, said, 'When a Muslim is questioned in his grave, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbears witness that there is no god but Allah, and that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad is the Messenger of Allah.' According to one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treport, the verse, 'Allah will establish in strength\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who believe with the Word, that stands firm in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld and in the Hereafter' (Qur'an 14.27) was revealed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerning the punishment of the grave. The deceased will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe asked, 'Who is your Lord?' He will say, 'Allah is my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLord and Muhammad is my Prophet.' That is what is meant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the statement of Allah, 'Allah will make firm those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho believe with a firm statement in this life and in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thereafter'.\" (Al-Bukhari, Muslim, and Sunan)\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad and Abu Hatim reported that the Prophet, peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, said, \"When a deceased person is laid in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrave, he hears the sound of the footsteps of people as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey go away. If he is a believer, the prayer will stand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby his head, the fasting will be to his right, alms to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this left, and all other good deeds of charity, kindness\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto relations, and good behavior will be by his feet. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeceased will be questioned by the angels at his head.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe prayer will say, 'There is no entrance through me.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThen he will be questioned by his right side where\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfasting will say, 'There is no entrance through me.' Then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the will be questioned by his left side where charity will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay, 'There is no entrance through me.' Then he will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestioned by his feet where the good acts of voluntary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharity, kindness to relations, and good behavior will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay, 'There is no entrance through me.' Then they will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay to him, 'Get up.'And he will get up. The sun will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappear to him and it will begin to set. Then they will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\task, 'This man who was among you, what do you say about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim? What is your testimony about him?' The man will say,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Let me pray.' The angels will say, 'You will pray.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnswer our question. What do you think about this man who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas among you? What do you say concerning him? What do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou testify concerning him?' The deceased will say, I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbear witness that Muhammad was the Messenger of Allah who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrought the truth from Allah.' The deceased will be told,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'According to this you lived, died, and according to this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou will be resurrected, if Allah wills.'\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Then a door to Paradise will be opened for him. He will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe told, 'This is your place in Paradise and what Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas prepared for you. ' At this the desire and happiness\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the deceased will increase. His grave will be enlarged\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t70 arms-length and his grave will be lit up. His body\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill change to his original form and his spirit will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplaced in a bird dangling by the trees of Paradise in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnice breeze.\" The Prophet, peace be upon him, added,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"That is what is meant by the statement of Allah, 'Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill establish in strength those who believe with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWord that stands firm, in this world and in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHereafter'.\" He also mentioned the unbeliever and said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"His grave will be compressed, so that his ribs will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcrushed together. About this the Qur'an says, 'Verily,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor him is a narrow life and We will resurrect him blind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the Day of Resurrection'.'' Qur'an 20.124\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSamura ibn Jundub reported, \"The Prophet, peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, after the prayers would turn toward us and ask us,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Did any one of you have a dream?' If someone had, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould relate it. Upon hearing it the Prophet, peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, would say, 'Whatsoever Allah wills (is done).'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOne day he questioned us saying, 'Did anyone of you have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta dream?' They answered, 'No.' Then the Prophet, peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, said, 'But I saw tonight two men. They came to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tme. They held my hand and took me to the holy land. We\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame across a man Iying down, and behold, another man was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstanding over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas throwing the rock at the man's head, crushing it. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trock rolled away and the thrower followed it and brought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit back. By the time he reached the man, his head was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trestored to its normal state. The thrower then did the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame as he had done before. I asked my two companions,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Who are these two people?\" They said, \"Proceed!\" So we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproceeded and came to a man lying flat on his back and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother man standing over his head with an iron hook.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBehold, he would put the hook in one side of the man's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmouth and tear off that side of his face to the back of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe neck and similarly tear his nose from front to back\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother side of the man's face and did just as he had done\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the other side. As soon as he tore one side, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother side returned to its normal state. Then he returned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanions, \"Who are these two people?\" They said to me,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Proceed!\" So we proceeded and saw a hole like an oven,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnarrow at the top and wide at the bottom, and fire\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tburning in it. In that oven there were naked men and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen, and behold, flames of fire were reaching them from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderneath, and when it reached them, they would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\traised high until they were close to the mouth of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toven. Then the fire subsided and they went back inside it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagain. I asked, \"Who are these?\" They said to me,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Proceed!\" And so we proceeded and came to a river of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblood. And behold, in the middle of the river was a man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstanding, and on the bank there was one who had many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstones. The man who was in the river would try to leave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut the other man would throw rocks into his mouth so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he would return to where he was. Every time the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformer tried to leave, the other would throw rocks into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this mouth. Then he would return to where he was. I asked,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Who are these people?\" They replied, \"Proceed! Proceed!\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWe proceeded until we came to a man with a repulsive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappearance, the most repulsive appearance you ever saw in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta man! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand running around it. I asked my companions, \"Who is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis (man)?\" They said to me, \"Proceed! Proceed!\" So we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproceeded until we reached a garden of deep green dense\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvegetation, bedecked with all sorts of spring colors. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe middle of the garden there was a very tall man. I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould hardly see his head because of his great height.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd around him there were more children than I had ever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseen before. I said to my companions, \"Who is this?\" They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied, \"Proceed! Proceed!\" So we proceeded until we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame to a huge majestic garden, greater and better than I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave ever seen! My two companions said to me, \"Go up,\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand I went up.'\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Prophet, peace be upon him, added, 'So we ascended\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuntil we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWe went to its gate and asked the gatekeeper to open the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgate. It was opened and we entered the city. There we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfound men with one side of their bodies as handsome as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe most handsome person you have ever seen, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseen. My two companions ordered those men to throw\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves into the river. Behold, there was a river\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflowing through the city, and its water was as white as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmilk. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturned to us after the ugliness of their bodies had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisappeared and they turned in the best shape.' I said to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem, \"I have seen many wonders tonight. What is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaning of all that I have seen?\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThey replied, \"We will inform you. As for the first man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou came upon whose head was being crushed with the rock,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the is the symbol of the one who studies the Qur'an and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen neither recites it nor acts on it, and sleeps,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneglects the enjoined prayers.

As for the man by the base\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the tree, he was Abraham. As for the children around\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, they are the children of the people.

Their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatus also varies as observed by the Prophet, peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him, during the night of Isra.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSome souls are in the form of green birds who roam around\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfreely in Paradise. These are the souls of some of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmartyrs, but not all of them. The souls of some martyrs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare prevented from entering Paradise on account of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdebts or some other similar thing. This is supported by a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treport by Ibn Hanbal in his Musnad from Muhammad ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbdallah ibn Jahsh that \"A man came to the Prophet, peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe upon him, and asked, 'O Allah's Prophet! What would I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave if I am killed in the cause of Allah?' The Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace be upon him, replied, 'Paradise.'  But, when the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman got up to go, the Prophet added, 'Unless you have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome debts to pay. Gabriel has informed me about it just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnow'.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSome souls will be locked out at the gate of Paradise, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccordance with this hadith: \"I have seen your companion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlocked out at the gate of Paradise.\" Other souls are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trestricted to their graves as is evident from the hadith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout the martyr who had stolen a cloak (He had stolen it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout of the spoils of war before their proper\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistribution) when he was killed, the people asked, \"Will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the have bliss in Paradise?\" The Prophet, peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, said, \"By Him in whose hand is my soul, the cloak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich he stole causes a fire to flare over him in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrave.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe abode of others is at the gate of Paradise, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescribed in a hadith by Ibn 'Abbas that, \"The abode of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmartyrs is in a green dome, on a bright river, near the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgate of Paradise. Their provision comes from Paradise in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe morning and in the evening.''  (Ahmad) This does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapply to Ja'far ibn Abi Talib, whose hands were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttransformed into wings, and with these he flies wherever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the wishes in Paradise.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOthers remain confined to earth, for these souls cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trise to heaven. Indeed, these are base, earthly souls\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich do not mix with the heavenly souls, just as they do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot mix with them during their sojourn on earth. A soul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat is oblivious to its Lord, blind to His love,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnegligent of His remembrance, and remiss in seeking His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpleasure is a despicable earthly soul. After separation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom its body, it cannot go anywhere, but remains here.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the other hand, the heavenly soul in this life clings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the love of Allah and to His remembrance, and seeks\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis pleasure and nearness. After separation from its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbody, it will join other kindred heavenly souls. In the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbarzakh (Literally an interval, a separation or a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpartition, Al-barzakh may be defined as the intervening\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate between death and the Last Day) and on the Day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tResurrection a person will be with those he loved. Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill join some souls with others in the abode of barzakh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand on the Day of Resurrection, placing the believer's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsoul with other pure souls, that is, other pure souls\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkindred to his soul. A soul, after separation from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbody, joins other kindred souls who in their nature and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeeds are similar to it and stays with them.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSome souls would be thrown in an oven or a pit along with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother fornicators and harlots. Other souls would be in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\triver of blood, floating therein and swallowing rocks.The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo categories of souls - the blessed and the damned - do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot share a similar abode, for there are souls that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treside in the highest reaches of heavens, while the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers, low and mean earthly souls, cannot rise above the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearth.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen one ponders the hadith and traditions on this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubject carefully, one can easily find the reason for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis. There is no contradiction in the sound traditions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton this subject. In fact, they are all true and each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupports the other. It is important, however, to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstand the soul and to appreciate its essence and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlaws that govern its functions. Indeed, the soul is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething completely different from the body. It is in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tParadise, but at the same time is attached to the grave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the body in it. It is the swiftest thing in moving,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelocating, ascending, or descending from one place to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother.These souls are divided into various categories:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe ones that are free to move about, those that are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfined, the ones that are celestial, and the others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat are earthly and of a low order. After separation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom their bodies, souls do experience health and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsickness, and they feel far more pleasure and pain than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey experienced when they were joined together.They are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubject to confinement, pain, punishment, sickness, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrief as they are to various states of joy, rest, bliss,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand freedom. How similar is its condition in the body to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen it was in the womb of its mother! And likewise how\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanalogous is its situation after separation from the body\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto when it came out of the womb into this world! There\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare four abodes of the soul, and each abode is bigger and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreater than the previous one.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe soul's first abode is the womb of the mother, where\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is confinement, compression, seclusion, and three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlayers of darkness.The second abode is its earthly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thabitat where it grows, does good and evil, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccumulates blessings for its ultimate success or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfailure. Its third abode is the abode of barzakh, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis more spacious and immense than the abode of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld. This abode, compared to the fourth one, is like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis [third] abode compared to the first abode.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe fourth abode is the abode of eternity, either\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tParadise or Hell. There is no other abode after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese.Allah causes the soul to pass through these abodes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin stages, until it reaches the abode most suitable for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit, an abode that only it deserves and for which it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[uniquely] suitable, because this abode was created for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit, and the soul was given the ability to perform the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeeds that lead precisely to this abode.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn each abode the soul enjoys a peculiar status and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tposition altogether different from what it has in other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabodes. Blessed indeed is soul's Originator and Creator,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWho gives it life, causes it to die, makes it happy or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubjects it grief and sorrow. Blessed is He Who appointed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor it various levels of success and failure, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistinguished them by various grades in accordance with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir knowledge, performance, faculties, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmorality.Whoever truly understands and appreciates this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot, but bear witness to the fact that there is no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeity except Allah, Who has no partners. With Him alone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trests all authority, praise, and all that is good, and to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHim alone all affairs return for decision. His is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsolute authority, and all dominion, might, honor,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twisdom, and perfection free of any defects or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timperfections. He is known through the testimony of His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruthful Prophets and Messengers. They did indeed come\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith Truth. Reason testifies to its truthfulness, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnature supports and confirms it. And anything that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontradicts this testimony is untrue.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"
