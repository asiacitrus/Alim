In another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith, 'Aishah reports that the Prophet sallallahu alehi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twasallam would perform nine rak'at during the night and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he would not sit during them until the eighth rak'ah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin which he would make remembrance of Allah, praising\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHim, and would make supplication. Then, he would stand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout making the taslim and pray the ninth rak'ah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter which he would sit, make the tashahud and make the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaslim in such a manner that we could hear him. Then, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould pray two rak'at after the taslim while sitting, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat would make eleven rak'at. When he became older and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theavier, he would make the witr with seven rak'at,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperforming the (last) two rak'at like the first one. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother version from her, it is stated: \"When he became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tolder and bulkier, he would make the witr with seven\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trak'at, and he would not sit during them, save in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsixth and seventh rak'ah and he would not make the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttaslim, save in the seventh rak'ah.\" In yet another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tversion, it is stated: \"He would pray seven rak'at and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould not sit, save in the last of them.\" This is related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the group.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAll of the preceding ahadith are authentic and clear and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is no contradiction in them.

This is an authentic hadith, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe statement that he observed witr with seven or five\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trak'at is equally true. Both statements confirm each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother. The seven, five, nine, and one rak'ah constitute\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe witr prayer, for witr is the name given to the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trak'ah offered in conclusion of whatever is offered prior\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto it. And the witr of the five, seven and nine rak'at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare all connected like the maghrib which is described as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree connected rak'at. If one breaks apart the five or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseven rak'at with two taslim, like in the eleven rak'at,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit will all be called witr due to the last odd rak'ah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is supported by the Prophet's statement: 'The night\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayer is sets of two rak'at.

Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSireen narrates that Anas ibn Malik was asked: \"Did the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet make the qunut in the dawn prayer?\" He answered:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Yes.\" They asked him: \"Before the ruku' or after it?\" He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treplied: \"After it.\" This is related by the group save\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat-Tirmidhi.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere is a report from Anas which says: \"The Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah sallallahu alehi wasallam did not stop making qunut\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduring the dawn prayer until he left this world.\" This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated by Ahmad, al-Bazzar, adDaraqutni, al-Baihaqi, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Hakim who says it is sahih.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, there remains some doubt concerning this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevidence since the qunut which they asked Anas about, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis clear in the narrations of al Bukhari and Muslim, was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe qunut during the time of calamities. Concerning the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlatter hadith (the one mentioned in support of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstand), in its chain of narrators there is Abu Ja'far\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tar-Razi who is not a credible source and, thus, one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot build a case upon his hadith. How could it be that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Messenger of Allah never stopped performing this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqunut until his death, and yet, the rightly guided\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaliphs did not perform it? It is even confirmed that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnas himself did not make the qunut in the dawn prayer!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf we must accept this latter hadith as authentic, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould mean that the Prophet always made supplications and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremembrance ( dhikr), after the ruku', until his death.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis would also come under qunut and, in this sense, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be more befitting. Still, this is one of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatters in which it is acceptable to have differences of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topinion, and one may either do it or leave it.

The fact that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet insisted that Abu Bakr lead the salah after he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas inforrned that he would be overcome by weeping proves\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it is permissible to cry while praying.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Umar prayed fajr and recited Surah Yusuf, and when he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treached the verse \"I expose my distress and anguish only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunto Allah,\" he raised his voice in crying. This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated by al-Bukhari, Sa'id ibn Mansur, and ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Mundhir. In 'Umar's raising his voice in crying is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefutation of those who say that crying invalidates the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsalah if it causes a sound from the mouth, regardless of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhether it is due to the fear of Allah or not.

When he performed ruku', he put her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown, and when he got up from his sajdah, he would place\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther back on his neck. 'Amr inquired during which salah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis happened.

The Prophet sallallahu alehi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twasallam acted differently from them, and carried a girl\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton his neck in the prayer, and making something clear by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texample is much more effective than a mere precept.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abdullah ibn Shidad relates that his father said: \"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah came to us either during the noon or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafternoon prayers and he was carrying Hassan or Hussain.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Prophet proceeded to the front and put him down and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade the takbir for the salah.

He said: 'None of that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappened but my son was resting and I hated to rush him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuntil he had finished what he desired.\"' This is related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Ahmad, an-Nasa'i, and al-Hakim.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn-Nawawi observes that this, according to the opinion of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tash-Shaf'i and those who agree with him, points to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermissibility of carrying or holding a young child, male\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor female, or any pure animal during an obligatory\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayer, and that it is permissible for both the imam and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe followers. The companions of Malik say that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermissibility is only for voluntary prayers and not for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligatory prayers. This interpretation is incorrect as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is clear that the Prophet was leading one of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligatory prayers, and as stated earlier it was the fajr\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayer. Some followers of Malik claim that its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermissibility has been abograted, while others say it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas only permissible for the Prophet, and yet others hold\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it was due to some necessity. All of this is wrong\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand to be rejected as there is no proof for any of it or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany necessity. The authentic hadith clearly states that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is permissible and there is nothing in that ruling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich contradicts any basic principle of the shari'ah as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta human being is pure and what is in his/her abdomen is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot relevant in this regard, as it remains within the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstomach, its natural receptacle. Also, the clothing of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchild is considered pure and the shari'ah is quite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplicit on this point. Actions during the salah do not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvalidate it if they are minor or few or dispersed. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfact that the Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam did this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis an exposition of its permissibility, and this argument\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis built upon the principle which we have mentioned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore. This refutes what Abu Sulaiman al-Khattabi says,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnamely, that the Prophet did not carry the child\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintentionally but the child was holding onto the Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand when he stood the child remained with him. He said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Do not think that he held him again intentionally as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat would be too much action and would distract the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theart. If a curtain distracted him, how could [the child]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot distract him?\" This statement by al-Khattabi, may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah have mercy on him, is incorrect and to be rejected.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmong the things that refute it are the statements in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSahih Muslim, \"when he stood, he carried him.\" And, \"when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the got up from his sajdah, he would return [the child to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this place].\" Further refutations are derived from a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tversion other than Sahih Muslim, \"He came to us while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcarrying Umamah and prayed...\" Concerning the ruling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout the curtain, it distracts the heart without there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing any benefit to it. Concerning carrying Umamah, we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare not convinced that it distracts the heart, and even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif it does, it is allowed due to its benefit and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprinciples that we have mentioned. The source of that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreoccupation is that benefit, which differs from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident concerning the curtain. Thus, the correct\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tposition is that the hadith is a clear exposition that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis permissible to carry a child in salah and this will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue to be part of the Islamic law until the Day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJudgment.

And the Prophet would pray\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon the pulpit, making ruku' there, but when the time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame to perform sajdah, he would descend, moving\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbackward, and prostrate upon the ground, and then return\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the pulpit. He once prayed toward a wall and an animal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttried to pass between him and the wall. The Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevented the animal from passing to the extent that its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstomach was against the wall. Once while he was praying,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo girls from the tribe of 'Abd al-Muttalib were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfighting behind him and he separated them with his arms\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhile he was praying. Ahmad's version says that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrabbed unto his knees and he separated them without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleaving the salah. On another occasion, when he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpraying, a boy came to him and he motioned to him to move\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tback, and he moved back. Then a girl tried to pass in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfront of him, he beckoned her to move back, but the girl\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassed, and when he finished, he said: \"They are more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetermined.\" Ahmad recorded it and it is also in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSunan. He would also puff out air while praying. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith which states: \" Puffing out is speech\" cannot be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraced to the Messenger of Allah, but Sa'id related it in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this Sunan from Ibn 'Abbas as one of Ibn 'Abbas'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatements - if it is authentic. The Prophet would cry\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduring his salah and would also clear his throat while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpraying. 'Ali ibn Abi Talib said: \"I had a certain time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat which I would visit the Messenger of Allah. When I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame to him, he would permit me to enter. If I found him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpraying, he would clear his throat and I would enter. If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the was free, he would give me permission to enter.\" This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis recorded by an-Nasa'i and Ahmad. Ahmad's version says:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"I could enter upon the Prophet during the day or night.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf I came to him while he was praying, he would clear his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthroat [as a sign that I may enter]. This was related by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad who used to act by it and he was not of the opinion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat clearing one's throat invalidated the salah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSometimes the Prophet would pray barefoot and sometimes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhile wearing shoes. This is what 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid and he ordered people to pray with shoes on in order\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto differ from the Jews. Sometimes he would pray in one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgarment and sometimes in two garments and [this latter]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas the majority of the cases.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

The proof for our\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tposition [i.e, the position of Ibn Hazm] is found in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords of Allah, the Exalted: \"Woe unto the worshippers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho are heedless of their prayers,'' and: \"And then there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsucceeded them a later generation who wasted the prayers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand followed their own lusts, but they will meet with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestruction.\" If one who intentionally misses a salah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould make it up later, then why is it mentioned with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffliction or transgression?

Here we shall mention some of the more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant reports.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad, Muslim, Abu Dawud, and al-Baihaqi record that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYahya ibn Yazid said: \"I asked Anas ibn Malik about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshortening the prayer, and he said: 'The Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah would pray two rak'at if he had traveled a distance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof three miles or farsakh.\"' Ibn Hajar writes in Fath\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Bari: \"This is the most authentic hadith which states\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand clarifies [that question].\" The conflict between mile\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand farsakh is made clear in Abu Sa'id al-Khudri's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatement: \"If the Prophet traveled a distance of one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfarsakh, he would shorten his prayer.\" This was related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Sa'id ibn Mansur in his Sunan and by al-Hafiz ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajar in at-Talkhis, and he implicitly accepted it by not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaking any further comments about it. It is well-known\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat a farsakh equals three miles and, therefore, Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSa'id's hadith removes the confusion which arises from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnas' hadith when he says that the shortest distance, due\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto which the Prophet shortened his prayer, was three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmiles. One farsakh is equivalent to 5,541 meters while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone mile equals 1,748 meters. The shortest distance which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been mentioned with respect to the shortening of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsalah is one mile. This was recorded by Ibn abi Shaibah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith a sahih chain, on the authority of Ibn 'Umar. Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHazm follows this report, and argues that if the distance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis less than one mile, one is not to shorten the salah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Messenger of Allah went to the graveyard of al-Baqi'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto bury the dead and (similarly) he went off to answer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe call of nature and did not shorten his salah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConcerning what some jurists say, namely, that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjourney must be at least two days long or as some say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree days, Imam Abu al-Qasim alKharqi's refutation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir opinion is sufficient for us. In al-Mughni he says:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 'I do not find any proof for what those scholars say.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe statements of the (sahabah) companions are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontradictory, and they are not a (conclusive) proof if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey differ. Something has been related from Ibn 'Umar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Ibn 'Abbas which differs from what these scholars use\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas proof. Even if that were not the case, their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatements do not constitute a proof when a statement or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taction of the Prophet himself exists. Even if their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatements were accepted, we would not be able to follow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe distance they mentioned due to the following two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treasons. One, they differ from the sunnah that has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated from the Prophet and from the clear meaning of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qur'an, as the clear meaning of the verse allows one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto shorten one's salah if one makes any journey upon the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearth. Allah says: \"If you journey on the earth, there is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno blame upon you if you shorten your prayer.\" The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition of there being fear has been deleted as can be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseen in the hadith we recorded from Ya'la ibn Umayyah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand what remains is the clear meaning of the verse which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcovers every type of journey. The Prophet said: \"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraveler may wipe over his socks for a period of three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays.\" This shows the length of time that one may wipe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover the socks and it cannot be used as a proof for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestion we are discussing here. One could argue that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraveling is less than a three-day journey on the basis\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the hadith: \"It is not allowed for any woman who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieves in Allah and the last day to travel a journey of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone day, save in the presence of a male relative.\" Two,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe question of the distance to be traveled is one that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmay only be answered by some sort of revelation from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, the Exalted [the Qur' an or Sunnah]; it is not the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttype of issue which one may address on the basis of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonal reasoning, nor is there any way to derive an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanalogy. The proofs which exist support the opinion that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshortening the salah is permissible for every traveler,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunless there is some consensus to the contrary.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSimilar to that is the traveling by planes, trains, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso forth, or a trip that is in obedience to Allah, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tExalted, or otherwise. If there is someone whose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccupation requires him to always be traveling, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance, a pilot, a ship captain, truck driver, and so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton, then he is permitted to shorten his salah or break\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this fast as he is truly traveling.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

The scholars differ on this point. Summing up and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiving his own opinion, Ibn al-Qayyim says: \"The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah stayed in Tabuk for twenty days and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduring that time he shortened his salah and he did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay that one may not shorten his salah if he stays longer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan that, although there is agreement that he did stay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere for that period of time.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Sahih al-Bukhari, it is recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Prophet stayed, during some of his journeys, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnineteen day and he prayed only two rak'at. If we stayed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin a place for nineteen days, we would not pray the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplete salah. However, if we stayed longer than that,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twe would perform the whole salah.\" Ahmad states that ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abbas was referring to the Prophet's stay in Makkah at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe time of its conquest when he said: \"The Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah stayed in Makkah for eighteen days during the time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the conquest as he had to go to Hunain and was not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplanning to stay there.\" This is his interpretation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn 'Abbas' statement. Others say that Ibn 'Abbas was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treferring to the Prophet's stay in Tabuk as Jabir ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abdullah said: \"The Messenger of Allah stayed in Tabuk\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor twenty days and performed qasr salah.\" Imam Ahmad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated this in his Musnad. Al-Miswar ibn Makhramah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treports: \"We stayed with Sa'd in some of the cities of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tash-Sham [Syria] for forty days, and Sa'd would perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqasr while we would offer the whole salah.\" Naf'i\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelates: \"Ibn 'Umar was in Azerbaijan for six months, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere was snow blocking the pass, and he would pray two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trak'at.\" Hafs ibn 'Ubaidullah says: \"Anas ibn Malik\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstayed in ash-Sham for two years and he prayed the salah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof a traveler.\" Anas relates: \"The companions of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet stayed in Ram Hurmuz for seven months and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshortened their salah.\" Al-Hassan reports: \"I stayed with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abdurrahman ibn Samurah for two years in Kabul, and he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshortened his salah but he did not combine the salah.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbrahim says: \"We resided in Rai for a year or more and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Sijistan for two years . . . [and we prayed qasr].\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is the guidance of the Prophet and his companions,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand this is the correct position.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConcerning other opinions which people follow Imam Ahmad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay: \"If a person intends to stay for four days, he has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto offer the whole salah and he may offer qasr if his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintention is for less than that. This is based on an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretation of the reports from the Prophet and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanions [i.e., they never intended to stay for longer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan that and would always say: 'We will leave tomorrow,'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand so on]. This interpretation is obviously suspect. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet conquered Makkah and stayed there to establish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam, eradicate polytheism, and to guide the Arabs. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefinitely goes, without saying, that such an objective\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes take more than a day or two to complete. Similarly,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this stay in Tabuk was in preparation for the impending\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twar and he knew that this might take longer than just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfour days. In the same way, Ibn 'Umar's stay in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAzerbaijan for six months, and his praying qasr during\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe entire time was with the knowledge that it takes more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan two or three days for such snow to melt and the pass\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto become traversable. The same is the case with Anas'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstay of two years in ash-Sham and his praying qasr and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe companions' stay in Ram Hurmuz for seven months while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshortening their prayers. It is well known that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactivities like theirs, such as jihad and guarding, took\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore than four days.\" The followers of Ahmad maintain:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"If one is staying in a place for the purpose of jihad or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdue to imprisonment or sickness, then one may shorten\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone's salah regardless of whether the person thinks that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch a situation may last for a short time or a long\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime.\" This is correct but there is no proof that such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions have been stipulated in the Qur'an, Sunnah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tijma' (consensus), or practice of the Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanions. They argued that such conditions are based on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat is needed for the person to fulfill his need while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremaining a traveler, and that is what is less than four\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays. His response to them was: 'From where do you derive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose conditions, while the Prophet sallallahu alehi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twasallam stayed for more than four days, shortening his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsalah, in Makkah and Tabuk, and he did not mention to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanyone anything about it and he never told them that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnever intended to stay for more than four days, even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthough he knew that the people would [strictly] follow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this actions concerning the salah. They surely followed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim in his shortening of the salah, and he did not object\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto their praying qasr if they were to stay for more than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfour nights. This should be made clear as it is very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant. Similarly, the companions (as-sahabah)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowed him in that and he did not say anything [in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobjection] to those who prayed with him.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik and ash-Shaf'i say: \"If one intends to stay for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore than four days, he should perform the whole salah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand if he intends to stay for less than that, he is to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffer qasr.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Hanifah holds: \"If one intends to stay for fifteen\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays, he should do the qasr. If he intends to stay for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tless than that, he should not shorten the salah.\" This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso the opinion of al-Laith ibn Sa'd, and it has also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen related from three companions: 'Umar, ibn 'Umar, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn 'Abbas.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSa'id ibn al-Musayyab is of the opinion that: \"If you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstay for four days, you pray four rak'at.\" A statement\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimilar to that of Abu Hanifah's has also been related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom him. 'Ali ibn Abi Talib says that if one stays for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tten days, he is to perform the whole salah, and the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been related from Ibn ' Abbas .\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Hassan says: \"One who does not get to his destination\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor (city of residence) may shorten salah.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Aishah says: \"One who does not put down his provision is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto shorten the salah.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe four imams agree that if one has some need to take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcare of and always has the intention of leaving the next\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tday, then he may shorten his salah for as long as he is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin that state. However, according to one statement of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tash-Shaf'i, he may do so only for seventeen or eighteen\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays and he is not to shorten his salah after that time.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn al-Mundhir states in his Ishraf: \"The people of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknowledge are in agreement that a traveler may perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqasr as long as he does not intend to stay in a place,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven though he stays there for years.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

There is no evidence whatever that those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions are even preferred - not to speak of being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligatory, or for that matter, being a necessary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition for the Friday salah. If two people pray the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJumu'ah in a place where there is no one else but them,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey would have performed their prescribed duty. If one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof them delivers the khutbah, they would be following\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat is sunnah; and if they leave the khutbah, then it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly the sunnah which they have neglected, (not something\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich was obligatory). But for the hadith of Tariq ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tShihab which clearly requires every Muslim to offer it in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcongregation and the fact that the Prophet sallallahu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talehi wasallam always performed it in a congregation,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffering it individually, like the rest of the prayers,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould have been quite acceptable. Concerning the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatement \"from four people to the ruler of the area,\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat is certainly not the Prophet's statement nor of any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his companions... In fact, [this is] a statement of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Hassan al-Basri. As to various statements and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpsuedojuristic opinions concerning this noble worship,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Friday prayer, which Allah has prescribed once a week\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas one of the signs of Islam, a little consideration\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould suffice to show their superfluity and error. One\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof these is the amazing statement that khutbah is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tequivalent to two rak'at of salah, and if one misses it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen his jumu'ah is not valid. They seem to be quite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tignorant of what has been related from the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough a number of chains which support each other that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"if a person misses one rak'ah, then he is to perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother rak'ah and his salah would be completed.\" Have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot other ahadith reached them that are valid in such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatters? Some say that one cannot perform the Jumu'ah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunless there are three people with the imam and others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thold that four people are needed, while yet others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstipulate seven people! Still others say nine, and some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthink twelve, twenty, thirty, and there are even some who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthink forty, fifty, seventy, and every number that is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween those numbers! Some hold that many people have to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe present without specifying a particular number, while\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers state that al-Jumu'ah may only be performed in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcity in which there is a \"congregational mosque.\" Some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare convinced that there have to be so many thousand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople living in the area. Some hold that there has to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta congregational mosque and a public restroom. Yet others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpropose that the prayer is not obligatory unless there is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta well-known and established imam; if such an imam cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe found or if his credibility is doubtful, then the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFriday salah is neither obligatory nor legitimate....No\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch statement can be found [in the book of Allah or in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sunnah] to support what they claim to be the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions or prerequisites of the Jumu'ah... Whoever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomes with such gibberish must be refuted for the only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcriterion is the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger. As Allah says in the Qur'an: \"If you dispute\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerning any matter, refer it to Allah and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger\"; \"The answer of the believers, when summoned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Allah and His Messenger, in order that he may judge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween them is no other than this: they say: \"We hear\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand we obey\"; \"But no, by thy Lord, they can have no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(real) faith, until they make thee judge in all disputes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween them, and find in their souls no resistance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconviction.\" Those verses and others similar to them are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe clearest evidence that one must return to the rule of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah and His Messenger if there is any dispute. The rule\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah is the Book of Allah. The rule of the Messenger,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter his passing away, is his sunnah and nothing other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan that. Also, Allah did not endow any of his slaves -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven if he reaches the highest degree of knowledge and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas accumulated what no one else has - with the right to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake any statement concerning this religion without any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority from the Book or the Sunnah. Likewise, if a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmujtahid (jurisconsult) should take liberty of proposing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan opinion without substantiating it, then it is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermissible for anyone to follow him in that, regardless\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof who he may be.

During the Prophet's time, there was only one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadhan and that was made when the Prophet sat upon the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpulpit. Bilal would make the adhan and then the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould give the two khutbahs. Next, Bilal would make the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tiqamah and the Prophet would lead the people in salah. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis not possible that the Prophet would have made a salah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the adhan nor anyone else among the Muslims who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayed with the Prophet could have done so. And we have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tno evidence to show that the Prophet, sallallahu alehi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twasallam, prayed in his house before going out to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmosque on Friday. He did not specify any time for any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsalah before the Friday salah. What he said was meant to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texhort those going early to the mosque on Friday to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tengage themselves in prayer. He said: 'Whoever goes out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearly and walks and does not ride to the mosque and prays\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat has been prescribed [by Allah] for him...' That has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen related from the Prophet's companions. When they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould reach the mosque on Friday, they would pray\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhatever amount was easy for them. Some of them prayed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tten rak'at and some prayed twelve and some only eight and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers less than that.

The time for the takbirat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduring the 'id of the sacrifice is from the day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Arafah until the time of the 'asr on the thirteenth of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDhul-Hijjah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Hajar writes in Fath al-Bari: \"None of that has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfirmed from the Prophet. The most authentic report\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the companions is that 'Ali and Ibn Mas'ud would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake the takbirat from the day of 'Arafah to the 'asr of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe last day of Mina. Ibn al-Mundhir and others reported\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit. AshShaf'i, Ahamd, Abu Yusuf, and Muhammad follow that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treport and it is also the view of 'Umar and Ibn 'Abbas.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere is no specific time for the takbirat during the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays of tashriq (three days after 'idul adha). In fact,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is preferred to pronounce takbirat during every moment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof those days.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Bukhari recorded: \"During 'Umar's stay at Mina, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould say takbirat in his tent [so loud] that the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the mosque would hear it and then they would start\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoing it also and the people in the market place would do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same and all of Mina would resound with the takbirat.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn 'Umar used to say the takbirat, during those days of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMina, after the prayers and while on his bed, in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttent, while sitting and while walking during all of those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays. Maimuna would say the takbirat on the day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrifice. The women used to say takbirat behind Abban\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tibn 'Uthman and 'Umar ibn 'Abdulaziz along with the men\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the mosque during the days of tashriq.\" Al-Hafiz ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajar said: \"These reports show that the takbirat are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade during all the times of these days, after salah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall other times. Some say the takbirat are made only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the salah, and some say they are to be made only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the fard prayers and not after nawafl, others\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeclare them to be for men and not for women, while some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay that they are only to be said in congregations and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot individually, while others reserve them only for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who perform the salah on time and not for those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare making up a missed prayer, and some say only for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresidents and not travellers, whereas others think they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare only for the people of the city and not for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople of the countryside. Apparently al-Bukhari is of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe opinion that it is for all people and the reports\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat he has transmitted support his opinion.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese takbirat can be made in many different forms. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost authentic form is that which has been recorded with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta sahih chain by 'Abdurrazaq from Salman, who said: \"They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade takbirat with: 'Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\takbar kabeera.\"' From 'Umar and ibn Mas'ud the following\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis related: \"Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar. La ilaha\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tillallah. Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar wa lillahil-hamd.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTranslation: Allah is the greatest, Allah is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreatest. There is no God but Allah. Allah is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreatest, Allah is the greatest. All praise belongs to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"
