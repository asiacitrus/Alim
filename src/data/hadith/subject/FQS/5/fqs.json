Ash-Shafi'i considers such a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith weak, while Abu Hanifah and Malik consider it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsound) and others are mauquf. (A hadith reported from a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanion through words or acts uninterruptedly or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\totherwise) They all prove that the ability to arrange\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone's provisions and possession of means of journey is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary prerequisite for Hajj, and this despite the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) knew that many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the people (in his time) were able to go for Hajj on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfoot.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSimilarly the words of Allah: \"Pilgrimage thereto is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduty men owe to Allah - those who can afford the journey\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderline the fact that ability and power are the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary prerequisite for all forms of worship. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsignifies the unspecified power or a little bit more than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat may be necessary. In the case of sawm (fasting) and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsalah (obligatory prayers) the financial ability is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuperfluous and is not specified in the Qur'an, unlike\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj for which it is an important requirement. Similarly,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj is a form of worship which involves traveling for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich one must be in possession of sufficient means to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupport oneself (and one' s family), as well as be able\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto shoulder the cost of the journey as in jihad.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn this regard we may refer to the Qur'anic verse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(9.91-92) \"Nor is there any blame on those who find no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresources to spend, nor is there (blame) on those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcome to you to be provided with mounts, and when you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, 'I can find no mounts for you,.\"'\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Al-Muhadhib we read: \"If someone has the money to buy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovisions and the passage to Hajj but he needs it to pay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this debts, Hajj is not binding on him, whether the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettlement of the debt is required immediately or is due\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter a time. The debts that are due for immediate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettlement must be paid at once, whereas the Hajj may be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformed later on in life. But if he spends all that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas on Hajj he may not be in a position to pay off his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdebt.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSimilarly, if one is in need of a dwelling or a servant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto help him, he may be classified as unable to perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj. Likewise, if one needs to take a wife because he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfears he may not be able to avoid evil, he must get\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarried, for it is his immediate need. Furthermore, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone needs goods for his business to obtain requisite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresources therefrom, such a one, according to Abul\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abbas, Ibn Sarih, may be classified as unable to perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj in view of his specific need. Al-Mughni says: \"If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe debt is owed to a wealthy person who does not demand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timmediate settlement of the loan, defers settlement to a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlater stage, and is ready to permit the debtor to proceed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor Hajj, then such a debtor is (technically) able to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperform Hajj. But in case the lender cannot afford to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefer settlement of the loan, the debtor would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treckoned as unable to perform Hajj.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to the Shafi'i school: \"If someone offers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother a free passage for Hajj, one is not obliged to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccept the offer, for it is a favor and involves distress\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof being obliged to another person. If, however, such an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffer is made by one' s son to perform Hajj, then one is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligated to do so, for one can perform it without being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeholden to anyone else.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Hanbali school is of the view that an offer of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfinancial help by someone else does not obligate a person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto perform Hajj, nor does this classify him as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(financially) capable of performing it, whether the offer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomes from a stranger or a relative and whether the offer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovides means of travel and provision, or linanacial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelp as such.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

He again mounted al-Qaswa, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen he came to Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram, he faced Qiblah, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupplicated to Allah, Glorified Him, and pronounced His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUniqueness and Oneness, and kept standing till the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdaylight was very clear.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"He then went quickly before the sun rose, and seated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehind him was Al-Fadl ibn 'Abbas, who wa.s a man with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeautiful hair, fair complexion, and handsome face. As\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) moved on, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgroup of women riding camels was also passing. Al-Fadl\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegan to look at them.

The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (peace be upon him) went by the Dab road to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArafah. Similarly he used to take different routes going\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto or coming back from 'Eid prayers) which comes out at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe greatest Jamarah, he came to the Jamarah which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnear the tree. At this he threw seven small pebbles,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying, 'Allahu Akbar' while throwing every one of them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin a manner in which the small pebbles are thrown\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(holding them with fingers) and this he did while at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbottom of the valley.

He shared the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremaining camels with Ali, who sacrificed them. He then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommanded that a piece of meat from each sacrificed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanimal be put in a pot. When it was cooked, both of them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(the Prophet and Ali) ate some of it and drank its soup.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) again rode\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand came to the House (of Allah), where he performed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTawaf Al-Ifadah and oftered the Zuhr prayer at Makkah. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame to the tribe of 'Abd al-Muttalib, who were supplying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twater at Zamzam, and said: 'Draw water, O Banu 'Abd\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Muttalib; were it not that people would usurp this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright of supplying water from you, I would have drawn it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talong with you.' So they handed him a bucket and he drank\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe scholars said: \"This hadith is one of its kind. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontains lots of valuable information.\" Al-Qadi 'Iyad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: \"Many scholars have spoken (and written) at great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlength about the legal injunctions contained in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith.\" Abu Bakr ibn Al-Mundhir has listed a large part\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof these identifying about one hundred and fifty\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinjuctions. He observes that if he had analysed more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclosely this number would almost double.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe scholars said: This hadith indicates that for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen giving birth to a child or having monthly periods\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is sunnah - and much more so for others - to take a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbath when they intend to perform Hajj or 'Umrah. It also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteaches us that the women who are menstruating or are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstill in their confinement after childbirth, should clean\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves properly, cover their private parts with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpiece of cotton, then declare their ihram. It also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindicates that ihram must be declared after offering\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teither a fard or a supererogatory prayer. After declaring\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tihram one should utter talbiyah loudly and preferably use\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same words as used by the Prophet (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim). However, there is no harm in adding similar phrases\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas 'Umar did: \"O Allah! I answer Your call, You Who gives\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessings and good favors. I answer Your call fearing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYou, and wishing Your favor.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis hadith also indicates that a pilgrim must first come\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto Makkah where one must perform circumambulation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarrival in Makkah (Tawaf qudoom), and touch the Black\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tStone--if possible--and make the first three rounds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trunning, while making the other four walking at normal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspeed. The running is done around the Ka'bah except\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter making the Tawaf one must go to the Station of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbrahim (peace be upon him) and recite the verse: \"Take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Station of Ibrahim as a place for prayer.\" Then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstanding there, with the Station of Ibrahim between him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the Ka'bah, he should pray two rak'ahs reciting after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Fatihah, Surah Al-Kafirun in the first rak'ah, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSurah Al-lkhlas in the second rak'ah. This hadith also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindicates that touching the Black Stone again prior to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleaving the Sacred Mosque is recommended (if possible),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjust as one did upon entering it. There is consensus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the scholars that touching (kissing) the Black\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tStone is sunnah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter that, one must make Sa'i and for this purpose go to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmount Safa. climb it, face the Ka'bah and make\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupplications three times to Allah. Then. one must climb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdown and walk toward Marwah, while jogging in the marked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarea called bainal milain between Safa and Marwah every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime one passes this area during the seven rounds not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjust in the first three rounds as in Tawaf. On reaching\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMarwah one should climb it just as one climbed Safa, make\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupplications, and make remembrance.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompletion of all these rites will complete one's 'Umrah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow one should either shave one's head or clip some of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone's hair to get out of the state of ihram. This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprecisely what the Companions of the Prophet (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon him) did when the Prophet (peace be upon him)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommanded them to change their Hajj to 'Umrah. As for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpilgrim who is combining Hajj and 'Umrah, he must not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshave or clip his hair, but should remain in his state of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tihram.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the 8th of Dhul-Hij jah. those who had put off their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tihram after making 'Umrah, should again put on ihra77l to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperform pilgrimage, and then head to Mina with those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcombine Hajj and 'Umrah. It is sunnah to offer the five\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdaily prayers in Mina and to spend the night of the 9th\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Dhul-Hijjah there.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is also sunnah not to leave Mina for 'Arafah until\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the sunrise, and not to enter 'Arafah until the sun\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbegins to decline, and after ot'fering both Zuhr and 'Asr\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayers, which the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNamira which is not a part of 'Arafah. The Prophet (peace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe upon him) did not enter his quarters at 'Arafah until\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter otfering Zuhr and 'Asr prayers. Moreover, it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) to offer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome supererogatory (nawafil) prayers in between these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo prayers.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe imam should give a sermon before the prayer, which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone of the sunnah sermons in pilgrimage. The second\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsermon is given by the imam on the 7th of Dhul-Hijjah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter Zuhr prayer in the Ka'bah. The third of these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsunnah sermons is delivered on the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe day of slaughtering. And the fourth sermon is given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the day the people leave (yawm an-nafr)--the 11th day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Dhul-Hijjah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis hadith also contains some important manners and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tetiquette for performing Hajj and 'Umrah:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOne is thereafter permitted to engage in any lawful\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactivity that was unlawful for him while in the state of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tihram, including sexual intercourse with one's wife.

Then we were commanded by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet (peace be upon him) to declare our intention for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj on the night of the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah. After\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompleting all the rites of Hajj, we went and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcircumambulated around the Kabbah, walked between Safa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Marwah, and thus we completed Hajj and we offered the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacrifice as Allah says, \"If anyone wishes to continue\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe 'Umrah onto the Hajj, he must make an offering such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, he should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfast three days during the Hajj and seven days on his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn ... (to his country).\" (Qur'an 2.196) Offering a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsheep in sacrifice is enough for this purpose. These\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) combined\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo worships in one year: Hajj and 'Umrah. Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned it in His Book and (reinforced it) by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice of His Prophet (peace be upon him), making it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermissible for all people, excepting the residents of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah. Allah says (Qur'an 2.136): \"This is for those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhose household is not in (the precincts of) the Sacred\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMosque.\" The Hajj months referred to are Shawwal,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDhul-Qui'dah and DhulHijjah.

Ibn Jarir agrees and prefers this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tview. The Hanafi scholars hold that all those living\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithin or at the miqat are residents of Makkah.

Thus, if a person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintended to perform Hajj but did not utter talbiyah, his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj would still be valid, and he is not required to do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything, because according to them, such a person enters\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe state of ihram just by making intention to perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHanafi scholars hold that talbiyah or any substitute for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit - such as containing praise or glorification of Allah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand bringing an animal for sacrifice -is a requisite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondition for the validity of ihram. If someone puts on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe garb of ihram without uttering talbiyah or glorifying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah or bringing a sacrificial animal, his ihram is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvalid, because ihram, according to them, is a combination\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof intention and one of the rites of Hajj. Thus, if one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeclares his intention for ihram and performs any of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trites of Hajj, for example if he glorifies Allah or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeclares, \"There is no deity worthy of worship but Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talone,\" or if he brought his sacrificial animal along\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith him but did not utter talbiyah, his ihram will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvalid but he will be required to sacrifice an animal as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpenalty for failing to do so.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to the well-known position of Imam Malik,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuttering talbiyah is obligatory and in cases where one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfails to do so or does not utter it upon donning the garb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof ihram but utters it later on, one must slaughter an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanimal in atonement.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

He should perform it in the same manner as he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad earlier performed Tawaf Al-Qudum. If the pilgrim is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperforming Hajj Tamattu', he must perform a Sa'i after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis Tawaf Al-Ifadah. For a pilgrim performing Hajj Qiran\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor Ifrad, this second Sa'i is not essential, if on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarriving in Makkah he had performed a Tawaf Al-Qudum.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter this tawaf - Tawaf-Al-Ifadah - a pilgrim may engage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin all normal lawful activities including sexual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercourse with his wife.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe pilgrim must now return to Mina and stay overnight\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere.

Then he should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgo to the last Jamarah, throw pebbles at it, and leave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout stopping there. A pilgrim should finish throwing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpebbles at the three Jamarahs well before the sunset. On\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe 12th of Dhul-Hijjah he should repeat the rites of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevious day.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHaving thrown the pebbles a pilgrim is free either to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn to Makkah before the sunset of the 12th of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDhul-Hijjah, or spend the 13th of Dhul-Hijjah as well in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMina, and throw pebbles at the Jamarahs.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThrowing pebbles is an essential rite of Hajj and for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfailing to do so one must offer a sacrifice.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter returning to Makkah if the pilgrim desires to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn to his home country he must perform TawafAI-Wida'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor Farewell Tawaf, which is also an essential rite of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHajj. In case he is unable to perform it, and if he has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot crossed the miqat, he should return to Makkah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperform it, or else sacrifice a sheep.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn short, the essential rites of Hajj and 'Umrah are:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeclaring ihram from miqat, tawaf, Sa'i, halq (shaving\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone' s hair) or qasr (or cutting one' s hair short). With\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese the rituals of 'Umrah are completed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the case of Hajj one has to perform certain additional\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trites. The essential rites of Hajj are spending a Day at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArafah, throwing pebbles at Jamarahs, Tawaf Al-lfadah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstaying in Mina, slaughtering an animal, shaving or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcutting one's hair short.
