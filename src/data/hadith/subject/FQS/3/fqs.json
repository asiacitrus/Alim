The term\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis derived from the Arabic verbal root meaning \"to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincrease.\" \"to purify,\" and \"to bless.\" It find its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torigin in Allah's command to: \"Take sadaqah (charity)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom their property in order to purify and sanctify them\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[at-Taubah 103]. That is why this kind of sadaqah is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcalled zakah, for by paying it, one is aspiring to attain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessing, purification, and the cultivation of good\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeeds.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTaking into account its very nature, it is no wonder that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakah constitutes one of the five pillars of Islam. It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassociated with prayer (salah) in eighty-two Qur'anic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverses. Allah, the Exalted One, prescribed it in His Book\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(The Qur'an), His Messenger corroborated it by his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(sunnah), and the community (ummah) by consensus  upheld\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit. Ibn 'Abbas reported that when the Prophet, upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace, sent Mu'adh ibn Jabal to Yemen (as its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgovernor), he said to him: \"You are going to a people who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare People of the Scripture. Invite them to accept the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshahadah: that there is no god but Allah and I am His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger. If they accept and affirm this, tell them that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, the Glorious One, has enjoined five prayers upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem during the day and night. If they accept that, tell\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem also that He has enjoined sadaqah upon their assets\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich will be taken from the rich of the (Muslim)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommunity and distributed to the poor. If they accept\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat, refrain from laying hands upon the best of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoods and fear the cry of the oppressed, for there is no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbarrier between Allah and it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt-Tabarani relates in al-'Awsat and as-Saghir, on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority of 'Ali, that the Prophet said: \"Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoined upon rich Muslims a due to be taken from their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperties corresponding to the needs of the poor among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem. The poor will never suffer from starvation or lack\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof clothes unless the rich neglect their due. If they do,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah will surely hold them accountable and punish them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseverely.\" According to at-Tabarani: \"It was reported\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly by Thabit ibn Muhammad az-Zahid.\" Of Thabit's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcredibility, al-Hafiz in turn says: \"Thabit was an honest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand trustworthy person. AlBukhari and others related from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim, and the rest of the narrators in the chain are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsidered as accepted authorities.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the early days of Islam at Makkah, no limit or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trestriction was placed on the amount to be donated, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat decision was left to the individual Muslim's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconscience and generosity. In the second year of hijrah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to the widely known authorities, both the type\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the quantity of zakah revenues were determined, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetailed illustrations were provided.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

However, there are a number of reports that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorroborate each other with regard to the evidence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovided by [their] texts. Their rationale is that since\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmerchandise is a form of cash, there is no difference\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween it and dinars or dirhams in terms of which it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvalued. This means that the form of the nisab can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talternate between value in the form of cash and that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich is valued in the form of merchandise. If zakah had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot been obligatory on merchandise, the rich--or most of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem --would have converted their cash into merchandise\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor trading purposes, making sure that the nisab of gold\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand silver is never possessed by them for a year.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe main consideration here is that by levying zakah on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe rich, Allah the Exalted wants to help the poor and to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpromote the welfare of the people in general. For the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trich, its benefit lies in cleansing their persons of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstinginess--both in money and feelings. For the poor, its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbenefit lies in easing their circumstances. Zakah thus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teliminates the causes of corruption which results from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe increase of money in a few hands. It is this wisdom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich the Qur'an refers to when it deals with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistribution of booty: \"... that it becomes not a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommodity between the rich among you\" (al Hashr 7).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTherefore, it is not reasonable to exempt businessmen\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom their societal obligations when they possess most of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe nation's wealth.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

In its application, a generic statement is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas important as a specific one. Should there be a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconflict between the two, then the most comprehensive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill be applicable. This is the rule.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt has been said that both of the preceding hadith ought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto be followed. In their essence, they do not contradict\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teach other, nor does one of them have to cancel the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother. The Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, has to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe obeyed in this matter, for he said: \"From what the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theavens water, a tithe [is due] . . .\" This saying seeks\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto distinguish between the two (categories): one on which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta tithe is due, and the other on which only half of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttithe is due. He therefore distinguished between the two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategories only in respect to the amount due. There is no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmention of any amount of nisab in this hadith. However,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the mentioned it explicitly in another hadith which cannot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe ignored as something that is general or is intended to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe so and not otherwise. It is similar to other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatements of general import which have been explained in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe texts.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Qudamah concludes: \"The saying of the Prophet, upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be peace, that 'there is no sadaqah [zakah] on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything less than five awsuq' is agreed upon. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith is specific, and for this reason takes precedence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand clarifies his previous statement of general import.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is similar to his saying that 'zakah is due on all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfreely grazing camels,' which becomes explicit by his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother saying on the same subject: 'There is no sadaqah on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tless than five camels.' Likewise his saying: 'Sadaqah on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsilver is a fourth of the tithe,' becomes specific by a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlatter utterance: 'There is no sadaqah on any amount less\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan five ounces.' Thus, it is possible to have holdings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich qualify for sadaqah per se, but on which it is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlevied.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen it comes to land produce, possession of a property\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor a year cannot be used as criterion, because their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaturity or growth is completed by the time of harvest,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand not by their continuity extended beyond a year.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, possession is considered for goods other than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tland produce since it is generally assumed that by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tend of the year they must have completed their growth.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe principle of attaining a nisab on any property is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbased on the understanding that a nisab is an amount\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlarge enough to be subjected to zakah. This may be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplained by recalling that sadaqah is obligatory for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trich, which presupposes the existence of nisab generated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby their holdings. For produce which cannot be measured\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut qualifies for zakah, a sa'a is used. One sa'a is a \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeasure equal to one and one-third cups (gadah). Thus, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnisab is fifty kaylah (kaylah is a dry measure of weight,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Egypt it is equal to 16.72 L). As to the produce which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot be measured, Ibn Quadamah says: \"The nisab of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaffron, cotton and such items is to be weighed at 1,600\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIraqi pounds (ratl, an Iraqi ratl equals approximately\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t130 dirhams). Thus, its weight is estimated.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Yusuf says that if the produce cannot be measured,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen zakah can only be levied on it when its value\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattains the nisab of articles subject to the lowest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstandard of measurement. Thus, zakah will not be levied\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton cotton until its value reaches five awsuq of an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarticle to the lowest value so measured, such as barley\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the like. This is because it is impossible to measure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe article in itself except by the lower price of two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnisabs. According to Muhammad ibn al-Hasan: \"For zakah, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproduct has to reach five times the greatest value of its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkind. Thus, zakah is not payable on cotton when it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treaches five qintars, because evaluation by means of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twusuq is based on the consideration that its value is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thigher than what is valued in kind.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

It may also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave alluded to dissensions which could prevail at the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tend of time and which would lead to neglecting or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfulfilling the obligation of zakah, jizyah and other such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdues by them.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn-Nawawi says: \"If this hadith means what they [the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHanafiyyah] claim, then it means that zakah could not be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoined on dirhams, dinars, and merchandise. If this is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso, then nobody subscribes to it.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt was reported that when the dahqan (grandee) of Bahr\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Mulk embraced Islam, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab said: \"Give\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim the land and collect the land tax from him.\" This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta clear statement on the matter of taking kharaj without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdemanding payment of the tithe.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis incident indicates that kharaj is not cancelled for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany person after he embraces Islam, nor does it lead to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe cancellation of tithe. He mentioned kharaj here as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tway of stating that it will not be cancelled by embracing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam, like jizyah. As for the tithe, it is well known\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it is binding on a free Muslim, so there is no need\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto mention it. He also did not mention the levy of zakah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton cattle. This holds for the payment of zakah on silver\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand gold and other valuables. Perhaps the dahqan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(grandee) did not possess anything which required the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlevy of a tithe on it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is said that the practice of the rulers and imams was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot to combine the 'ushr and kharaj. Ibn al-Mundhir\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisapproves of such a practice because 'Umar ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abdulaziz did combine the two.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is also said that kharaj is the opposite of 'ushr.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis means that kharaj is a consequence of conquest,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhereas 'ushr is an act of worship. Therefore, the two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot be combined (at one time) and obtained\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimultaneously from the same person. This held true in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe beginning (when lands were conquered), but it is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttenable in the long run. Nevertheless, not all forms of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkharaj are based on force and conquest since some of its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforms are instituted without force as, for example, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe case of lands adjoining a kharaj land or in the case\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof acquired and revived land watered with streams.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is also said that the reason behind the imposition of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkharaj and 'ushr is one--that is, an actually or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpotentially yielding land. This can be explained by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecalling that if it is marsh land of no benefit\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(sabkhah), there is no kharaj or 'ushr on it. That is,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone cause cannot demand two dues of the same kind. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis similar to the case of an individual who for a year\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossesses free-grazing camels (sa'imah) intended for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsale, for such a person is not required to pay two kinds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof zakah--that is, one for possession and one for trade.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is not the case because the 'ushr (tithe) is payable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the land's produce and the kharaj on the land itself,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregardless of whether it is planted or not. As to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmissibility of the unity of cause, alKamal ibn al-Humam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplains there is nothing to prevent two obligations from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing connected to one cause, such as land.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMost scholars are of the opinion that anyone who rents a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpiece of land and cultivates it must pay the zakah, not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe true owner of that land. To this Abu Hanifah replies:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Zakah is due on the land owner.\" Ibn Rushd holds: \"Their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifference lies in whether the 'ushr is payable on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tland itself or its produce.\" Obviously, zakah, as their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tviews suggest, is payable on either of them. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifference is only of priority, considering that both the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproduce and the land belong to the same owner. Most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscholars say that zakah is due on seeds (habb). Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHanifah holds that the essence of obligation rests with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe land. Ibn Qudamah inclines toward the majority's view\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand says: \"The obligation lies on the produce and is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpayable by its owner, as in the case of zakah on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvalue [of a property] intended for trade. Also, it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimilar to the tithe payable on the produce of the land\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towned.\" Their (the Hanafiyyah) view is not authentic, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif zakah were to be levied on the value of the land, then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit would have been obligatory even if the land was not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcultivated, as is the case with the land tax, and even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnonMuslirns would not be excluded from its application.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBe that the case, kharaj would have to be estimated on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe land itself, not on the value of produce--that is, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be considered part of the expenditure of fay', not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe expenditure of zakah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

Each is ordered not to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadd or separate his possessions to obtain a lower or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thigher sadaqah. Since the owner would naturally prefer a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlow sadaqah on his property, he would combine or separate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this possessions accordingly. The same would also be true\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the zakah collector, who might like to collect as much\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsadaqah as possible. By using the phrase khashyat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassadaqah (for fear of sadagah), the Prophet meant that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit may become more or less since both altematives were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible. This shows that he did not prefer one choice\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover the other. Therefore, he made both altematives\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible. According to the Hanafiyyah: \"This is, in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsense, a prohibition on the zakah collector's separating\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe property of a person so that his sadaqah is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincreased. For example: a man possesses 120 sheep. If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey are divided into three lots of forty each, the zakah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould amount to three sheep. Another example: if they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcombine the property of one man with the property of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother, the sadaqah would increase. Thus, if a person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towns 101 sheep and another owns an equal number, then the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakah collector, if he combines the two lots, would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecure three sheep as payment toward zakah, while the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactual amount due is only two sheep.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

However, if the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflocks of sheep are considered separately, then the zakah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdue on each lot is only one sheep. As for the case of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree associates, each of them having forty sheep, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey combine them, the zakah due is one sheep--that is,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe zakah due for each partner is one-third of a sheep.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, if treated separately, each should pay one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsheep.

The second opinion, that zakah is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe responsibility of the owner, means that he should pay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakah twice, one for each year, as zakah is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponsibility of the owner and is not affected by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecrease of the nisab.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Hazm favors the view that it is the owner's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponsibility.

Concerning payment of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakah from a different lot of wheat, barley, dates, gold,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsilver, camels, cattle, and sheep, he says it does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter whether one pays it from the same lot, from a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifferent one in one's possession, or from a lot that may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe bought, granted as a gift, or borrowed.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe conviction that the payment of zakah is the owner's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponsibility and is not necessarily that of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty itself is a sound principle, for if it becomes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdue on the property itself, the owner will not be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermitted to make payment from a different lot. It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimilar to the case of one partner being prevented from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiving his money to his copartner from a source other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan the one involved in their partnership--unless the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpartners approve of it and it does not violate the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconditions of the transaction between them. Furthermore,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif zakah has to be applied to the property itself, only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo situations can arise. First, zakah is payable on all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparts of that property and is applicable to any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindividual amount of it, without individual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecification. Second, if it is applicable to every part\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof it, it is impermissible to sell from any herd or grain\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsince zakah collectors in this case would become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpartners. Thus, the proprietor is not allowed to take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything from it. This is void without any dispute.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFurthermore, it would become obligatory upon him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecify exactly the price of the sheep which he desires\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto take out, just as is done in partnerships. If zakah is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdue on any part of it other than the property itself, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecomes void. This holds true in such a case since he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes not know what he might sell or whether he is taking\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat is due for the sadaqah collectors.

When part of it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperishes, the perished portion is not subject to zakah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis is in accordance with the rule that zakah is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassociated with the property itself.

Ash-Shaf'i, alHassan ibn Salih, Ishaq,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Thaur, and Ibn al-Mundhir hold that if the nisab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperishes before zakah is paid, then the owner owes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnothing. However, if it perishes subsequent to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccumulation of the nisab, the owner has to pay it. Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQudamah supports this view and says it vitiates the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpayment of zakah if the property perishes without any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnegligence on the part of the owner. This is because it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis obligatory for the sake of beneficence, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresupposes the existence of the property--and not with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe purpose of impoverishing the payers of zakah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNegligence in this context implies that the owner had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccumulated the nisab and thus it was possible for him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpay zakah, but he did not and the property perished. On\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe contrary, if he did not have the nisab, or the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tholdings were not in his possession, or they were to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurchased and he could not, then this does not constitute\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan act of negligence.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLikewise, if it is presumed that the obligation to pay\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakah remains even after the holdings are lost, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towner has the means to pay it, then he must do so.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOtherwise, he should be granted a respite in order to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfulfill his obligation to pay zakah.

This would be similar to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcase of a man who divorces his wife during his terminal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tillness. His evil intention calls for punishment as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tredemptive act.

He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twas absent at the time but came forward later and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twent with the Muslims to fight in the battle of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHunayn before his acceptance of Islam.

Thereupon Safwwan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid: \"This is a gift from someone who does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfear poverty. By Allah,\" he continued, \"the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, upon whom be peace, has given all of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthis to me and verily he is the person whom I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdislike the most, but he continued to give me\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthings until he became the one I loved the most.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li><li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPeople whose evil is feared, and it is hoped that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmoney, if given to them, will neutralize their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thostility: Ibn 'Abbas reported: \"A group of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople used to come to the Prophet, upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace.

The Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tupon whom be peace, gave every one of them one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thundred camels.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li></ul><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Hanafiyyah say that the share of such people are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcancelled when Islam is strong. For instance, 'Uyainah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tibn Hisn, al-Aqra' ibn Habis, and al-'Abbas ibn Mirdas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcame to Abu Bakr and requested their share. He wrote them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta letter, which they took to 'Umar. He tore the letter\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand said: \"This is something that the Prophet, upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace, used to give you to reconcile you to Islam.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow, Allah has fortified Islam and it is no longer in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneed of you. Unless you stay with Islam, the sword will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe between you and us. Say: 'It is the truth from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLord of you [all]. Then whoever will, let him believe,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand whoever will, let him disbelieve' [al Kahf 29].\" They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturned to Abu Bakr and said: \"Are you the Caliph or is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Umar? You wrote a letter for us and 'Umar tore it up.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe answered: \"This is the way it is.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Hanafiyyah continue: \"Indeed, Abu Bakr agreed with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Umar, and none of the companions disapproved of it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLikewise, it was never reported from 'Uthman or 'Ali that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey gave anything to anyone in this category.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt can be answered that the case under reference was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Umar's own judgment. He saw that there would be no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbenefit in mollifying these people after Islam had become\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell-established among their people, and no harm would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollow if they abandoned Islam. Also, if 'Uthman and 'Ali\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstopped spending this kind of endowment, this does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessarily mean that the provision for it was repealed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is possible that the change of circumstances did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcall for the continuation of such an endowment to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnonbelievers. However, this does not amount to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvalidation of the provision for such endowments. Should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe contingency call for its revival, the endowments in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis category can be given. This is because their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsanction lies in the Qur'an and sunnah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad and Muslim reported from Anas that whenever the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, upon whom be peace, was asked for anything for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sake of Islam, he would give it away. A man came and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasked for sadaqah. The Prophet ordered that the man be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven the entire lot of sheep between two mountains.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThese sheep were part of the sadaqah. The man returned to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this people and said: \"Oh my people! Accept Islam, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindeed, Muhammad gives in such a way as if he does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfear poverty.\" Ash-Shaukani says that al-'Itrah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Jobbani, al-Balkhi, and Ibn Mubashshir held that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsadaqah may be given to those whose hearts are to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treconciled to Islam. On the contrary, ash-Shaf'i\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaintains that such endowments are not for unbelievers.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs for the sinner (faszq), he may be given from such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallocations.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Hanifah and his followers hold that this kind of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tendowment was cancelled with the spread and domination of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam and, as evidence, they cite Abu Bakr's refusal to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trestore endowments to Abu Sufyan, 'Uyainah, al-Aqra', and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-'Abbas ibn Mirdas. It appears that reconciliation is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermitted when the need for it arises. In other words, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis permitted to give them sadaqah for reconciliation when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta people obey a leader only for worldly affairs, and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcannot be controlled except by force and domination. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspread of Islam has no ramification on the issue of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treconciliation because it makes no difference in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcase. The author of al-Manar testifies: \"This is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole truth. Only independent judgment can be exercised\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto elaborate on the eligibility and the amount of sadaqah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor booty to be given away when they are available, along\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith other kinds of property [immovable and movable]. It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis necessary to seek consultation of capable people (ahl\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tashShura) as the caliphs did in those matters that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trequired ijtihad. Whether a leader can force them into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobedience by coercive action before resorting to the use\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the endowment is an unsettled issue. Nevertheless,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis cannot be followed as a rule but rather as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprinciple of inclining to the lesser of two evils and to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe best benefit of the society.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

At-Tirmidhi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrades this report as good and sound.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs to the meaning of free captives (wa fi ar-riqab),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tash-Shaukani says that scholars differ over it. 'Ali ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Talib, Sa'id ibn Jubair, al-Layth, ath-Thauri,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-'Itrah, the Hanafiyyah, the Shaf'iyyah, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmajority of scholars are reported to believe that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefers to contracted slaves (rnukatabdn) whose freedom is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecured through payment from zakah. According to Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abbas, al-Hasan al-Basri, Malik, Ahrnad ibn Hanbal, Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThaur, and Abu 'Ubaid, it means using zakah in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelease of any kind of slave. Al-Bukhari and Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Mundhir are also supportive of this view. Their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trationale is that the expression wa fi ar-riqab cannot be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfined to the kind of slavery arising from a contract\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause, if that had been the case, then it would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfallen under the category of those in debt (gharimln),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor theirs is an obvious case of debt. As such, freeing a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave from bondage is better than helping a contracted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave. He could be aided or helped, but not freed, for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe contracted slave is a slave as long as he owes even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone dirham. At the same time, freeing a slave is possible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat any time, in contrast to the situation of a contracted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCommenting on the subject, az-Zuhri says that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreceding position entails two possibilities. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'anic 'ayah on the subject alludes to these two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossibilities, which have been pointed out by ashShaukani\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin his Muntaqa al-Akhbar. In the hadith narrated by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talBara', evidence suggests that redeeming necks is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same as freeing them. Nor is the deed of freeing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslaves the same as helping contracted ones with money to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpay off the contract. Both of these bring the individual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcloser to Heaven and distance him from Hell.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

If other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategories are for some reason ineligible for their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare, it will be distributed among those still eligible.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is not permissible to disregard any category if it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeets the conditions for eligibility. Ibrahim anNakha'i\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsays that if the amount of zakah received is large, then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is possible to divide it among the different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategories. However, if it is small, it is permissible to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplace it into one category. Ahmad ibn Hanbal holds that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe division of zakah has a priority but that it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermissible to give it all to one category. Malik\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaintains that the distributor of zakah should make an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teffort to investigate those who are in need. He should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistribute it according to the immediate condition of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneedy and poor people. Thus, if he sees in certain years\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the poor need more, they should be given priority.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf he sees in another year that the wayfarers are more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneedy, he should distribute it among the travelers. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHanafiyyah and Sufyan athThauri thought that the zakah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpayer can choose the categories he wished to distribute\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe zakah to. This is related by Hudhaifah and Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abbas. Al-Hasan alBasri and 'Ata' ibn Abi Rabah base\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir opinions on it. Abu Hanifah holds that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistributors of zakah may give it to one person under any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the eight categories.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

                "text": "<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe author of ar-Rawdah an-Nadiyyah says: \"Distributing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall of the zakah to one group is more benefiting to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealization of the word of Allah.\" In brief, one may say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Allah made zakah applicable only to the eight\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecifically mentioned categories. Spelling out these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategories does not mean that the zakah has to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistributed among them equally or even that it has to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivided among them. The intended meaning, however, is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the categories of sadaqah are similar to various\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgroups of people who are eligible for it. Thus, one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis obligated to pay anything to any category of sadaqah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand gives it to a person in a parallel group is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsidered to be fulfilling what Allah commanded him to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo. Contrary to this, if one divides his zakah due into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe acknowledged eight categories, if all eight exist,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen that would not only be contrary to the practice of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Muslims throughout history, but it would cause\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thardship to the payer of zakah. For example, if the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcollected zakah were meager, it would be of no benefit to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany designated category--even if it was of one kind, to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsay nothing if it was of numerous kinds. To endorse such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta practice would be tantamount to counter what the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, upon whom be peace, did when he permitted the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpayment of a penance (kaffarah) from the charity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcollected for Salmah ibn Sakhr. Obviously, the hadith of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas-Suda'i cannot be used as evidence.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere is not a single case in the entire corpus of hadith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tliterature which could be used to make the distribution\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof zakah to all groups of people obligatory. Using the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith of Mu'adh as evidence that the Prophet, upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace, instructed him to take zakah from the rich\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYemenites and give it to their poor will not be of much\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelp because it does not establish that the zakah was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistributed to all the groups. Nor is the hadith of Ziyad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tibn al-Harith as-Suda'i valid in this regard because in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits chain of narrators is 'Abdur-Rahman ibn Ziyad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-'Afriqi, whose credibility has been questioned by many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscholars. Assuming that this hadith is valid for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoint under discussion, the meaning of the division of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakah into parts is its distribution according to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapparent meaning of the Qur'anic 'ayah and what the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, upon whom be peace, had in mind. Assuming that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe division of zakah itself is intended, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistribution has to be done according to the specified\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategories. In this case, any transfer of the share of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone group to another, even if the group concerned was for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome reason non-existent, will not be permissible. Such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan approach will be contrary to the consensus of Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscholars. If we accept that, then the deciding factor for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sadaqah's distribution is the leader's wish rather\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan, and not the specific categories of eligible people.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThus, there is no evidence that makes division\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligatory, and it is consequently permissible to give\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome sadaqah to those eligible people and some to other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgroups. Indeed, when the leader collects all the sadaqat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom his people and all eight categories are eligible to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceive them, each group has the right to claim its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare. However, he does not have to divide the collected\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsadaqat among them equally or distribute it without any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistinction, for he can give any amount to any group or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgroups that he wants to, or he can give some without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiving the rest if he thinks it is in the interest of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam and its people. For example, if the sadaqah was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcollected and then a jihad was announced, meaning that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould become necessary to defend the territory of Islam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst the unbelievers, the leader can give some or all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof it to the deserving warriors. This also applies to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother concerns if the interest of Islam necessitates it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

I and 'Uthman ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Affan came to the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace, and said to him: 'O Messenger of Allah! Do not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeny Banu Hashim the grace of their position because\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah placed you among them. How about our brothers Banu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Muttalib?

The Prophet, upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace, answered: 'I and Banu al-Muttalib are not to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseparated either during jahiliyyah or Islam. We and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare one.' Then he joined his fingers [in demonstrating\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe close relationship].\" Reason dictates that one should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot differentiate between them (the two families) in any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter of law because they are one according to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying of the Prophet. It is evident that they are the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfamily of Muhammad, and therefore, sadaqat are forbidden\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto them. Abu Hanifah holds that the family of Banu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Muttalib may take from zakah. Both these reports are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated by Ahmad. Just as the Messenger of Allah, upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be peace, made charity unlawful for the family of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBanu Hashim, he also made it unlawful for their proteges\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(mawla).

Abu Hanifah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad, al-Hasan, and Abu 'Ubaidah maintain that in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch a case he would not be required to pay another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakah.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMa'an ibn Yazid reports: \"My father set aside a few\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdinars for sadaqah and gave them to a man in the mosque.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI went and took them and brought them back to my father.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe said: 'By Allah! What have you done?' I consulted the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, upon whom be peace, about it. The Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobserved: 'O Yazid, for you is what you intended and O\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMa'an, for you is what you have taken.' \" This is related\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Ahmad and al-Bukhari. The meaning of this hadith is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat sadaqah is supererogatory (nafl); however, the word\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tma (meaning what) in laka rna nawayta (for you is what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou intended) denotes generalization. Abu Hanifah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad are supported in their stand by a hadith from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Hurairah which reports the Prophet, upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace, saying: \"A man [from Banu Isra'il] said [to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself]: 'Tonight I will give away something in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsadaqah.' So he went out with his sadaqah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[unknowlingly] gave it to a thief. The next moming he was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttold by the people that he had given sadaqah to a thief.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[On hearing this,] he said: 'O Allah! Praised be You.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCertainly I will give sadaqah again.' So, he went out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith his sadaqah and [unknowingly] gave it to an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadulteress. The next moming he was told that he had given\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsadaqah to an adulteress. The man said: 'O Allah! Praised\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe You. [I gave my sadaqah] to an adulteress. Certainly I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill give sadaqah again.' Thus he went out with his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsadaqah again and [unknowingly] gave it to a rich person.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe next moming the people said that the night before he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad given his sadaqah to a wealthy person. He said: 'O\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah! Praised be You. [I have given my sadaqah] to an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadulteress, a thief, and a rich person.' [In his dreams]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the saw someone saying to him: 'The sadaqah you gave to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe thief might make him abstain from stealing, and that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven to the adulteress might make her abstain from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tillegal sex [adultery], and that given to the wealthy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson might make him learn a lesson from it and spend\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this wealth, which Allah, the Exalted One, has given him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Allah's cause.' \" This is related by Ahmad,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Bukhari, and Muslim.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Prophet, upon whom be peace, said to a man who asked\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim for sadaqah: \"If you were eligible for zakah, I would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave given you your due.\" He (the Prophet) gave (zakah)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto two well built persons saying: \"If you wish, I will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgive from it [sadaqah]. There is no portion in it for a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twealthy person or a healthy individual who is eaming.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Qudamah says: \"If he would have considered the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treality of the rich person, he would not have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontented with what they said [conceming this matter].\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe opinion of Malik, ash-Shaf'i, Abu Yusuf, ath-Thauri,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Ibn al-Mundhir is that it will not be sufficient for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta zakah payer to give it to the undeserving, especially\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen his mistake becomes clear. In that case, he should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpay zakah once again to those who deserve it. His case is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimilar to the case of unpaid debts (owed) to other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople. Ahmad says that there are two opinions conceming\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone paying zakah to a person whom he thought was poor and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlater leamed was rich. The first contends it would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsidered paid, while the second says that it would not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe. When it becomes known that one who received zakah is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta slave, an unbeliever, a Hashimite (a person from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet's family), or an ineligible relative of the zakah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpayer, then one has not discharged one's obligation, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason being that it is difficult to know who is rich and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho is poor: \"The ignorant man thinks that since they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[who do not ask for] are modest they are free from want\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[al-Baqarah 273].\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

In this statement: '... to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsteadfast in prayer, and to give zakah,' Allah mentions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakah with salah, which substantiates the fact that 'to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspend of your property out of love for Him' does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefer to obligatory zakah, for that would be redundant in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe 'ayah--and Allah knows best.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe scholars agree that should a need arise, even when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakah has been paid, the Muslim community is bound to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontribute toward the alleviation of the problem.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMalik says: \"It is obligatory for the people to ransom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose taken as prisoners of war, even if doing so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsumes all their property. The consensus on this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubject strengthens our view, and we seek success only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough Allah.\" According to al-Manar, the 'ayah \"... and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto spend your property out of love for Him . . .\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[alBaqarah 177] means that one should give the property\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the sake of Allah or for the love of giving it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tImam Muhammad 'Abduh's comments are: \"The giving of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty in excess of the due zakah is considered one of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe basic elements of piety (birr) and is enjoined like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe prescribed zakah.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhenever the exigency calls for it, sadaqah other than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tzakah is given. That could be before the completion of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe year (hawl) or after the payment of zakah. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontribution is not based on a specific amount of nisab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut on the ability to give. Thus, if someone possesses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly a loaf of bread and sees a person who is more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thard-pressed than himself, he should give it to that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson. The hard-pressed person is not the only one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas a right to be satisfied, but Allah has also ordered\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe believers to give non-prescribed sadaqat to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowing: kin, orphans, needy, wayfarers, beggars, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslaves.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

Generosity urges support for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe above-mentioned people and forbids harming them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tReferring to the guilty in the life to come, the Qur'an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsays that they would ask each other: \"What brought you to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis hellfire?\" They will answer: \"We were not of those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho prayed, nor did we feed the needy\" [al-Muddaththir\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t42-44]. Thus, Allah links feeding the needy with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperforming prayers.

It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, upon whom be peace, said: \"He whose holdings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texceed his needs, let him support the one whose holdings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo not, and he whose food exceeds his needs, let him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshare it with him who does not have food.\" Abu Sa'id\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Khudri says: \"Then he mentioned so many kinds of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty that we thought no one of us had the right to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave anything surplus with us.\" This is the consensus of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe companions, as it was reported by Abu Sa'id alKhudri.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tConcerning this tradition, it is reported on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority of Abu Musa al-Ash'ari that the Prophet, upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom be peace, said: \"Feed the hungry, visit the sick,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand ransom the prisoner.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere are many 'ayahs in the Qur'an and numerous sound\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith on this subject.

Then he said: \"It is not permissible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor a hard-pressed Muslim to eat the meat of a dead\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanimal or a pig when he can find surplus food from either\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta Muslim or a dhimmi. It is an obligation of the one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas food to feed the hungry.\" This has the consensus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the companions, and there are no contrary views\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerning it. It was accurately reported from ashShu'bi,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMujahid, Tawus, and others that: \"There is a due on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproperty other than zakah.\" If such is the case, then a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thard-pressed person is not forced to eat the meat of dead\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanimals or pigs. He has the right to fight for it and, if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the is killed, then retaliation by killing (qawad) will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timposed upon the killer. If the property holder who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevents him from receiving his due is killed, then may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the have the curse of Allah upon him because he withheld a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright (haqq), and he will be regarded as being among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunjust.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, the Exalted One, says: \"And if one party of them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes wrong to the other, fight those who do wrong until\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey return to the ordinance of Allah.\" Thus, one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithholds a right is an oppressor of his brother. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlatter is the possessor of that right.

Similarly,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif one fears that one's fasting during travel will look\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike showing off, then in this case, breaking the fast\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould be preferred.

The most apparent conclusion is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat none of them break the fast. The fast is part of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligion of Islam. Both the layman and specialist must be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknowledgeable about it. If the preceding actions were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforbidden by Allah and His Messenger to the fasting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson because they would ruin the fast, then it would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been obligatory upon the Messenger to clarify that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfact. If he had done so, his companions would have known\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabout it and would have passed it on to the rest of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims. Since no one has related that not from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, not with an authentic or a weak hadith, nor in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmursal or musnad form then it must be the case that such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacts do not void [the fast].\" He also says: \"If the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\truling is one that would affect everyone or everyday\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatters, then the Prophet would have clarified it to a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeneral audience. It is well-known that kohl was in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommon use as were oils, washing, incense, and perfume.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf they broke the fast, the Prophet would have mentioned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem, as he mentioned other things [that break the fast].\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSince he did not do so, they belong to the class of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperfumes, incense, and dyes. Incense goes through the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnose and enters the head and lands on the body. Dyes or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toils are absorbed by the skin and the body is refreshened\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby it. The case of perfumes is similar. Since these have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot been [explicitly] prohibited to the fasting person,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit points to the fact that using them is permissible for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fasting person and so is kohl. The Muslims during the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime of the Prophet would injure themselves, either from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjihad or otherwise, and would injure their stomachs or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tskulls. If that would have ended their fasts, it would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been made clear to them [by the Prophet].\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSince that was not prohibited for the fasting person, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmust not break the fast.\" Ibn Taimiyyah continues: \"No\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone eats kohl and no one causes it to enter his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstomach--neither through his nose nor through his mouth.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnal enemas are also not taken as food. Indeed, it helps\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe body to release whatever is in the intestines and it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes not reach the stomach. Any medicine that is used to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttreat stomach wounds or head injuries [that is taken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torally] is not considered similar to food. Allah says in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qur'an: 'Fasting is prescribed for you as it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprescribed for those before you.' The Prophet, upon whom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe peace, said: 'Fasting is a shield,' and, Verily, Satan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trushes through the body like the flowing of the blood [in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe body].

If they had intercourse out of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforgetfulness or not due to choice--that is, due to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcoercion, or they did not have the intention to fast,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen the expiation is not obligatory on either one of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem.

An-Nawawi says: \"The most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthentic opinion, in general, is that the expiation is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligatory upon the man only and that there is nothing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon the woman.

He said: 'I have not heard of any.' \" In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Mughni it is stated: \"This refers to the fact that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet ordered the man who had had sexual intercourse to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfree a slave. He did not order the woman to do anything,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talthough he obviously knew that she was a partner in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tact.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to most scholars, acts of expiation must be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformed in the order that was mentioned in the hadith.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe first command is to free a slave. If this is not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible, the person is to fast for two consecutive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmonths. If that is not possible, the person is to feed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsixty poor people with meals that are similar to an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taverage meal in his household. The person cannot jump\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom one act to another unless he is not able to perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe prior order commanded. According to the Malikiyyah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand a narration from Ahmad, the person is free to choose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany of the above three acts and that will be sufficient\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor him.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis latter opinion is based on the report from Malik and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn Juraij on the authority of Humaid ibn 'Abdurrahman\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho reported that Abu Hurairah narrated that a man broke\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this fast during Ramadan and the Prophet ordered him, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan expiation, to free a slave or fast two months\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsecutively or to feed sixty poor people. This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated by Muslim.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the preceding hadith, the word \"or\" implies choice,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut according to some, the reason for the expiation to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformed was different and therefore the person could\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchoose, as in the case of the expiation for breaking an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toath. Ash-Shaukani says: \"In the different narrations,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is evidence that the expiation is to be performed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin order or according to one's choice. Those who relate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit to be in order are more in number. Al-Muhallab and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Qurtubi combined the narrations and said that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevent [of someone breaking the fast] occurred more than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonce.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Hafidh differs: \"This is not correct. It was just one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevent and the parts are all united. So the crux of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter is that there was not more than one event. Some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcombine the reports and say that following the order is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreferred, but that one may choose. Others say the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topposite.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhoever has sexual intercourse (with his wife) on a day\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Ramadan and, before he performs the act of expiation,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas intercourse on another day of Ramadan, need only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperform one act of expiation according to a narration\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Ahmad and the Hanafiyyah. This is because there is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunishment for acts that are repeated, and if the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpiation or punishment is not carried out, all the acts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare taken together as one. According to Malik,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tash-Shaf'i, and Ahmad, the person must perform the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpiation twice, as each day of Ramadan is a separate act\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof worship. If the expiation is obligatory because the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson voided the fast, the separate acts are not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcombined together.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAll scholars agree that if the person intentionally had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercourse during a day of Ramadan and has performed the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpiation and then has intercourse on another day of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRamadan, then another expiation becomes obligatory upon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim. Similarly, they are in agreement that if one has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercourse twice during a day, before performing the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpiation for the first act, then he need only perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone act of expiation. If he has performed the expiation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the first one, then he need not perform an act of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpiation for the second, according to most scholars.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad says that in such a case, he must perform a total\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof two acts of expiation.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

Also, if he needs to eat or drink and there is no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone to bring him his food, he may leave to get it. If one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneeds to vomit, he may leave the mosque to do so.

'Ali said: \"What blame would there be upon you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif you go to the market to buy one?\" Qatadah used to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermit the person who was performing i'tikaf to follow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe funeral procession and to visit the sick, but not to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsit while doing so. Ibrahim an-Nakha'i says that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreferred that the person who was performing i'tikaf do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe following deeds and he was allowed to do them even if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the did not do them to visit the sick, to attend the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFriday prayers, to witness the funerals, to go out to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeet his needs, and not to enter a place that has a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tceiling. He said: \"The one who is performing i'tikaf\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould not enter a roofed place unless there is a need to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo so.\" Al-Khattabi says: \"A group of people say that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson performing i'tikaf may attend the Friday prayer,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvisit the ill, and witness funerals.

This means\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the person is not to leave his place of i'tikaf with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sole intention of visiting the sick, but if he passes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby him, he may ask about him provided it is not out of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this way.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

This is one of the types of words that have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore than one meaning. Those who say that it carries both\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeanings interpret 'touch' in the 'ayah . . . 'and touch\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem not and be at your devotions in the mosque' in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunrestrictive sense--that is, covering both sexual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercourse and also actions [of touching] that are less\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan that. Those who don't say it carries all of its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeanings and they are the majority say that the 'ayah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoints to sexual intercourse or to touching that is less\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan intercourse. If we say that it refers to sexual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercourse by consensus, then this nullifies the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossibility of it referring to actions less than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercourse, as one [single] word could not be taken in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits literal and figurative meaning [at the same time].\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThose who say that what is less than sexual intercourse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis included say so because it falls under the literal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaning of the verse.
