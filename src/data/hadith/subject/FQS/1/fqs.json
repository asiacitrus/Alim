For\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texample, hashish is prohibited but it is pure. But,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething impure is not necessarily prohibited. Every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timpure thing is prohibited, but not vice-versa. That is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecause of the ruling that something impure cannot be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttouched under any circumstances. If a ruling says that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething is impure, it is also prohibited. This differs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom a ruling that something is prohibited. For example,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is forbidden to wear silk and gold, but they are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsolutely pure by consensus.\" If one understands that,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen the prohibition of alcohol does not necessarily \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentail its also being considered impure: it needs some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother evidence to prove that it is impure. If not, then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twe are left with the original position that it is pure.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIf one claims other than that, he must substantiate it.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

Some have collected all of its narrations\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(from among the companions), and its number exceeds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teighty. This includes hadith from the ten pepole who were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpromised Paradise.\" The strongest hadith on this point\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been related by Ahmad, al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand at-Tirmidhi on the authority of Hammam anNakha'i who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"Jarir ibn 'Abdullah urinated, performed ablution\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand wiped over his socks.\" It was said to him, \"You do\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat and you have urinated?\" He said, \"Yes, I saw the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, urinate and then\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo likewise.\" Said Ibrahim, \"They were amazed at that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith, because Jarir had embraced Islam after surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Ma'idah was revealed (10 AH). One of its verses calls\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor washing one's feet. This hadith helps us understand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe verse by confining it to one who is not wearing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsocks. This constitutes a particular case, and the person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho wears socks can just wipe over them.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

In Ibn alQayyim's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTahdhib as-Sunan, he relates from Ibn al-Mundhir, \"Ahmad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade a statement about the permissibility of wiping over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslippers because of his fairness and justice.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNevertheless, the basis of this permissibility is the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractice of the companions and a manifest analogy. There\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis no real difference between socks and slippers. It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorrect that they take the same ruling. Most scholars say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat one can wipe over either one.\" Those who permit it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinclude Sufyan al-Thauri, Ibn al-Mubarak, 'Ata, al-Hasan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Sa'eed ibn alMusayyab. Commenting on this subject,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Yusuf and Muhammad said, \"It is allowed to wipe over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem if they are thick and completely hide what they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcover.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Hanifah did not approve of wiping over thick\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslippers, but he changed his mind three or seven days\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore his death. He wiped over his slippers during his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tillness and said to his visitors, \"I did what I used to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttell people not to do.\" Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah reported\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tablution and wiped over his socks and slippers. This is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelated by Ahmad, at-Tahawi, Ibn Majah and at-Tirmidhi,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho called it hassan sahih. Abu Dawud graded it weak.2\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs it is permissible to wipe over socks so is it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermissible to wipe over any foot covering, which has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen used to avoid the cold or protect the wound, and so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton. Of its permissibility, Ibn Taimiyyah says, \"It is all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright to wipe over foot covering because it takes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprecedence over wiping socks or slippers, for usually a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfoot covering is used for some need and to protect the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfeet from some harm. If wiping over the socks and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslippers is allowed, then wiping over any foot covering\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould come first. Whoever claims that there is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsensus on the inadmissibility of wiping over foot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcoverings does so with a lack of knowledge. Not to speak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof a consensus, he cannot prove its forbiddance even from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe works of ten famous scholars.\" He goes on to say,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Whoever ponders over the words of the Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, upon whom be peace, and gives analogy its proper\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplace, will know that the license from him was spacious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton this subject and in accord with the beauty of Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlaw and the monotheistic magnanimity with which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet had been sent.\" Even if there are some holes or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcuts in the socks, it is permissible to wipe over them,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas long as the person has only such socks to wear. Says\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Thauri, \"The slippers of the emigrants and helpers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere not free of cuts or holes, like the slippers of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople (in general).

In fact, Islamic law even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgoes to the extent of ordering one to perform ghusl at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis time as part of the overall cleanliness and hygiene\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Muslim society.

This understanding of the Prophet's saying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis derived from what al-Bukhari recorded about an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident from Ibn 'Umar about his father. One day, 'Umar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tibn al-Khattab was standing and delivering the khutbah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen 'Uthman, one of the people from among the emigrants\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand helpers, entered. 'Umar said to him, \"What time is it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnow?\" He said, \"I was busy and could not return home.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen I heard the call to prayer, I did not make more than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe regular ablution.\" 'Umar said, \"And the ablution\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly, when you know that the Messenger of Allah ordered\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tus to perform ghusl ?\" Commenting on the incident, says\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tash-Shaf'i, \" 'Uthman did not leave the prayer to perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tghusl, nor did 'Umar order him to do so. This illustrates\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the companions knew that this order was one of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchoice. It also shows that it is preferred.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim recorded that Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying, \"Whoever makes the ablution and perfects it and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen goes to the Friday prayer and listens attentively,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill have forgiveness during (the period) between the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFriday and the next (Friday), and an additional three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays.\" Says al-Qurtubi, \"This hadith shows that ghusl is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreferred. The mention of ablution, the reward and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacceptability points to the fact that ablution alone is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsufficient.'' Ibn Hajr states in at-Talkhis, \"It is one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the strongest proofs that ghusl for the Friday prayer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis not obligatory. The statement that it is preferred is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbuilt upon the fact that if one does not perform ghusl,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit will not harm (his prayer). But, if others are harmed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby his perspiration or bad smell from his clothes and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbody, ghusl becomes obligatory, and not performing it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetracts from the rewards of salah. Some scholars say\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Friday ghusl is a duty even if its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnon-performance causes no harm (to others). Their basis\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor this opinion is the hadith related by Abu Hurairah in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich the Prophet, upon whom be peace, said, \"It is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduty upon every Muslim to perform ghusl once every seven\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays, by washing his head and body.\" Al-Bukhari and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim accept the hadith mentioned on the subject in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir apparent meanings, and refute the ones contrary to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe last hadith (of Abu Hurairah).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe time for the Friday ghusl is between dawn and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime of the Friday prayer. It is preferable to do it at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe time of departure (to the mosque). If one loses his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tablution after that, it is sufficient for him just to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake a new ablution (he does not have to repeat the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tghusl).\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSays al-Athram, \"I heard Ahmad being asked if a person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformed ghusl, and then lost it, would the regular\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tablution be sufficient for him. He said, 'Yes, and I have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot heard anything about that preferable to the hadith of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn 'Abzi,\" Ahmad is referring to the hadith related by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn 'Abzi Shaibah (with a sahih chain from 'Abdurahman\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tibn 'Abzi on the authority of his father, who was a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanion.)He performed ghusl for the Friday prayer, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafterwards nullified his ablution. After that, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformed just the regular ablution, and did not repeat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this ghusl. The time for the ghusl ends with the time of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe prayer. If one performs ghusl after the prayer, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould not be the ghusl of the Friday prayer, and one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoes so is not following the Prophet's order.

This is based on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thadith of Umm Salamah, in which she asked the Messenger\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Allah, upon whom be peace, about this condition. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"She should wait for the days and nights of her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnormal period and figure them out of the month, and she\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould leave the prayer during those days. (Afterwards)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshe should perform ghusl, tighten something around her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvagina and then pray.\" (Related by Malik, ash-Shafi and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"the five,\" except for at-Tirmidhi.)\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEvaluating the report, an-Nawawi says, \"Its chain meets\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe conditions (of al-Bukhari and Muslim).\" Al-Khattabi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tholds, \"That regulation is for the woman who is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texperiencing prolonged blood flows. If the blood is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflowing, the Prophet ordered her to leave the prayer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduring her regular period, and to perform ghusl after her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcustomary time has passed. Then, she becomes just like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany other purified person.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the second case, a woman does not know her period well\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenough to determine if she is experiencing menstrual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbleeding or a prolonged flow of blood. In that case, her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmenstruation is considered to be six or seven days, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the most common among women.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSaid Jamnah bint Jahsh, \"I had a very strong prolonged\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflow of blood. I went to the Prophet to ask him about it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhen I asked him if I had to stop praying and fasting, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid 'Tie around a cloth, and it will stop.' I said, 'It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis greater than that.' He said, 'Curb it.' I said, 'It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflows greatly.' He then said, 'You may do one of two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthings: either one will suffice. Which one you are able\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto do you know best. This is a strike from Satan. Be on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyour period for six or seven days, which Allah knows, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthen perform ghusl until you see that you are clean. Pray\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor fourteen nights or thirteen nights and days and fast,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand that will be sufficient for you. Do that every month\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas the other women become pure and menstruate. If you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcan, you may delay the noon prayer and hasten the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafternoon prayer. Perform gh usl and pray the noon and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafternoon prayers together. Then delay the sunset and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thasten the night prayers and pray them together. Perform\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tghusl for the morning prayer and pray it. This is how you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmay pray and fast if you have the ability to do so...\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnd he said, \"That is the more loved way to me.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs to the authenticity of the hadith, it is related by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad, Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi, who grades it as hassan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsahih. He says, \"I asked al-Bukhari about it, and he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcalled it hassan.\" Ahmad ibn Hanbal says it is hassan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsahih.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Khattabi observes, in a note to this hadith, that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis for the woman who is a \"beginner\" and does not know\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther regular days of menstruation. The Prophet told her to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tact according to the customary situation of women, and to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsider herself as having her period only once a month,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike most women. His statement, 'As women menstruate and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas they become pure' points to this fact. This is by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanalogy to the affairs of women with respect to each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother in menstruation, pregnancy, maturity and other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffairs of theirs.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn the third case, a woman has a regular period, but she\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis able to distinguish the blood. She should, therefore,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehave according to the type of blood she sees. Fatimah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbint Abu Hubaish had a prolonged flow of blood, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet told her, \"If it is menstrual blood, it is dark\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand recognizable. If you have that, abstain from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayer. If it is other than that, make ablution and pray,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor it is a vein.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWomen who fall into any of these categories must abide by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe following regulations:\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

As prayer is the essence of Islam, we will discuss\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit here in detail.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTo state it simply, prayer must exist, for without it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam can not stand.

Its obligation was revealed directly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Prophet, during his ascension to heaven. Said\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAnas, \"The prayers were made obligatory on the Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon whom be peace, the night of his ascension to heaven.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt first, they were fifty in number, but were reduced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseveral times until they were five.

It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis the last thing that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecommended to his nation before he died, saying,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Prayer, prayer and what your right hand possesses.\" It\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill be the last thing taken away from the religion. When\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit perishes, Islam will perish. The Messenger of Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon whom be peace, said, \"If Islam were stripped away,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpiece by piece, people would hold tight to the next one.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe first thing taken would be ruling and governance, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe last thing would be prayer.\" (Related by Ibn Hibban\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the hadith of Abu Umamah.) In many verses of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an, Allah follows up prayer with the remembrance of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah. \"Lo! Worship preserves (one) from lewdness and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tiniquity, but verily, remembrance of Allah is more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant.\" (al-'Ankabut 45); \"He is successful who grows\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand remembers the name of his Lord, so pray (al-A'la\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t14-15); \"So serve Me and establish worship for My\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tremembrance\" (Taha 74). Sometimes He mentions prayer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talong with zakah: \"Establish prayer and pay zakah\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(al-Baqarah 110). And at times, with patience: \"Seek help\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin patience and prayer\" (al-Baqarah 45), and with hajj:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"So pray unto your Lord and sacrifice\" (al-Kauthar 2);\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Say: Lo! my worship and my sacrifice and my living and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmy dying are for Allah, Lord of the Worlds.

Of all the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the earth, am I not the most dutiful in being aware of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah?\" Khalid ibn al-Walid said, \"O Messenger of Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshall I kill him?\" He said, \"Perhaps he is one of those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho pray.\" Khalid said, \"How many people say with their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttongues what is not in their hearts?\" The Prophet said,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"I have not been ordered to look into the hearts of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople, nor to rip open their bellies.\" (Abridged from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Bukhari and Muslim.) In this hadith also, prayer is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven as the reason for not killing a person. It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstood, therefore, that not praying would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresulted in the person's killing.\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEven though the preceding hadith clearly rule that one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho discards salah becomes an unbeliever and should be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkilled, many early and later scholars (excluding Abu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHanifah, Malik and ash-Shafi) believe that such people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome evildoers who must repent. If such a person does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot repent, he is to be killed, that being the prescribed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunishment, according to Malik, ash-Shai'i and others.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Hanifah maintains that such a person is not to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkilled, but must be given a minor punishment and confined\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuntil he prays. They say the hadith that calls such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople unbelievers refer to those who deny the prayers,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand so on. They say that any other interpretation is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontradicted by other texts. For example, Allah says,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Lo! Allah does not pardon one who gives Him partners. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpardons all save whom He wills\" (an-Nisa' 116). There is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso a hadith related by Abu Hurairah and recorded by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAhmad and Muslim in which the Prophet, upon whom be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeace, said, \"Every prophet has a special supplication\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat is answered. Every prophet hastened to make his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupplication, but I concealed mine and will use it for my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnation on the Day of Resurrection. It will be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgranted--Allah willing--to whoever dies without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassociating any partners with Allah.\" Al-Bukhari also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecorded that Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon whom be peace, said, \"The person who will be the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappiest due to my intercession is the one who says,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'There is no god but Allah' sincerely from his heart.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSays ash-Shaukani, \"The truth of the matter is that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecomes an unbeliever who is to be killed for his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunbelief. The hadith authenticates that Islamic law calls\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone who does not pray an unbeliever. It has also put the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperformance as the barrier between a believer and an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunbeliever. Abandoning prayer means he may be called an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunbeliever. We need not concern ourselves with arguments\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpresented by those of the opposing opinion. We can say to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem: It is not impossible that some types of unbelievers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmay obtain forgiveness or may have a right to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintercession, such as the unbelief of those who pray to (\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tour) qiblah. Nevertheless, the fact remains that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommit some sins which the Islamic law views as unbelief.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTo turn to the other narrow interpretations is just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tredundant.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>"

He put\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe men in the row closest to him, the children in a row\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehind the men, and the women in a row behind the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchildren. After the iqamah, he raised his hands and made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe takbir, silently recited Surah al-Fatihah and another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurah, repeated the takbir and bowed while saying, \"Glory\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe to Allah and Praise be to Him\" three times, after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich he said, \"Allah hears him who praises Him\" and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstood straight. He then made the takbir and prostrated,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmade another takbir, raised his head (and sat), repeated\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe takbir and prostrated again, after which he said the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfinal takbir and stood up. In the first rak'ah he made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsix takbir, and he made another one when he stood for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecond rak'ah. When he finished the prayer, he turned to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this people and said, \"Guard the number of my takbir and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlearn my bowings and prostrations, for this is how the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet prayed with us during this part of the day.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Then he said) when the Prophet, upon whom be peace,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfinished the prayer, he turned toward the people and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaid, \"O people, listen and understand.

They do not dispute the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfact that the opening supplication is for the whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprayer. It is sufficient to seek refuge only once, as it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis apparent from the authentic hadith.\" Then he mentions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe preceding hadith of Abu Hurairah, and says, \"It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsufficient just to make one opening supplication, since\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is no real break between the recital of the prayer.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe only thing that is between them is the remembrance of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah, and so on.

He performed his prayer in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same manner that he asked others to pray--'light' or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'easy'. If his prayers were somewhat long, they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstill easy compared to how long he could have made them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe guidance that he came with and practiced is the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat decides our affairs and disputes for us.
