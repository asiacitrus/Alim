    "text": "<p>\\n\\t\\t\\tIt is narrated on the authority of Yahya ibn Ya'mar that the\\n\\t\\t\\tfirst man who discussed Qadr (Divine Decree) in Basrah was Ma'bad\\n\\t\\t\\tal-Juhani.  Humayd ibn AbdurRahman al-Himyari and I set out for\\n\\t\\t\\tPilgrimage or for Umrah and said: Should it so happen that we\\n\\t\\t\\tcome into contact with one of the Companions of the Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah (peace be upon him) we shall ask him about what is talked\\n\\t\\t\\tabout Taqdir (Division Decree). Accidentally we came across\\n\\t\\t\\tAbdullah ibn Umar ibn al-Khattab, while he was entering the\\n\\t\\t\\tmosque. My companion and I surrounded him. One of us (stood) on\\n\\t\\t\\this right and the other stood on his left. I expected that my\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanion would authorize me to speak.\\tI therefore said:\\n\\t\\t\\tAbuAbdurRahman! There have appeared some people in our land who\\n\\t\\t\\trecite the Holy Qur'an and pursue knowledge.  And then after\\n\\t\\t\\ttalking about their affairs, added: They (such people) claim that\\n\\t\\t\\tthere is no such thing as Divine Decree and events are not\\n\\t\\t\\tpredestined.  He (Abdullah ibn Umar) said: When you happen to\\n\\t\\t\\tmeet such people tell them that I have nothing to do with them\\n\\t\\t\\tand they have nothing to do with me. And verily they are in no\\n\\t\\t\\tway responsible for my (belief). Abdullah ibn Umar swore by Him\\n\\t\\t\\t(the Lord) (and said): If any one of them (who does not believe\\n\\t\\t\\tin the Divine Decree) had with him gold equal to the bulk of (the\\n\\t\\t\\tmountain) Uhud and then, it (in the way of Allah), Allah would\\n\\t\\t\\tnot accept it unless he affirmed his faith in Divine Decree. He\\n\\t\\t\\tfurther said: My father, Umar ibn al-Khattab, told me: One day we\\n\\t\\t\\twere sitting in the company of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim) when there appeared before us a man dressed in pure white\\n\\t\\t\\tclothes, his hair extraordinarily black. There were no signs of\\n\\t\\t\\ttravel on him. None amongst us recognized him. At last he sat\\n\\t\\t\\twith the Apostle (peace be upon him) He knelt before him placed\\n\\t\\t\\this palms on his thighs and said: Muhammad, inform me about\\n\\t\\t\\tal-Islam. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Islam implies that you testify that there is no god but Allah\\n\\t\\t\\tand that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, and you establish\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer, pay Zakat, observe the fast of Ramadan, and perform\\n\\t\\t\\tpilgrimage to the (House) if you are solvent enough (to bear the\\n\\t\\t\\texpense of) the journey. He (the inquirer) said: You have told\\n\\t\\t\\tthe truth. He (Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: It amazed us that he\\n\\t\\t\\twould put the question and then he would himself verify the\\n\\t\\t\\ttruth. He (the inquirer) said: Inform me about Iman (faith). He\\n\\t\\t\\t(the Holy Prophet) replied: That you affirm your faith in Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\tin His angels, in His Books, in His Apostles, in the Day of\\n\\t\\t\\tJudgment, and you affirm your faith in the Divine Decree about\\n\\t\\t\\tgood and evil. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe (the inquirer) again said: Inform me about al-Ihsan\\n\\t\\t\\t(performance of good deeds). He (the Holy Prophet) said: That you\\n\\t\\t\\tworship Allah as if you are seeing Him, for though you don't see\\n\\t\\t\\tHim, He, verily, sees you.  He (the enquirer) again said: Inform\\n\\t\\t\\tme about the hour (of the Doom). He (the Holy Prophet) remarked:\\n\\t\\t\\tOne who is asked knows no more than the one who is inquiring\\n\\t\\t\\t(about it). He (the inquirer) said: Tell me some of its\\n\\t\\t\\tindications. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That the slave-girl will\\n\\t\\t\\tgive birth to her mistress and master, that you will find\\n\\t\\t\\tbarefooted, destitute goat-herds vying with one another in the\\n\\t\\t\\tconstruction of magnificent buildings. He (the narrator, Umar ibn\\n\\t\\t\\tal-Khattab) said: Then he (the inquirer) went on his way but I\\n\\t\\t\\tstayed with him (the Holy Prophet) for a long while. He then,\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid to me: Umar, do you know who this inquirer was? I replied:\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah and His Apostle knows best. He (the Holy Prophet) remarked:\\n\\t\\t\\tHe was Gabriel (the angel). He came to you in order to instruct\\n\\t\\t\\tyou in matters of religion.\\n\\t\\t</p>"

He (the Holy Prophet) said: He has told the\\n\\t\\t\\ttruth. He (the Bedouin) said: By Him Who sent you (as a prophet),\\n\\t\\t\\tis it Allah Who ordered you about it (the fasts of Ramadan)? He\\n\\t\\t\\t(the Holy Prophet) said: Yes.  He (the Bedouin) said: Your\\n\\t\\t\\tmessenger also told us that a pilgrimage (Hajj) to the House (of\\n\\t\\t\\tKa'bah) had been made obligatory for him who was able to\\n\\t\\t\\tundertake the journey to it. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. The\\n\\t\\t\\tnarrator said that he (the Bedouin) set off (at the conclusion of\\n\\t\\t\\tthis answer, but at the time of his departure) remarked: By Him\\n\\t\\t\\tWho sent you with the Truth, I should neither make any addition\\n\\t\\t\\tto them nor should I remove anything from them.

And I prohibit\\n\\t\\t\\tyou from four (things): dry gourds, green-coloured jars, hollowed\\n\\t\\t\\tstumps of palm-trees, and receptacles. They (the members of the\\n\\t\\t\\tdelegation) said: Do you know what an-naqir is?  He replied: Yes,\\n\\t\\t\\tit is a stump which you hollow out and in which you throw small\\n\\t\\t\\tdates.\\tSa'id said: He (the Holy Prophet) used the word tamar\\n\\t\\t\\t(dates).

(The Holy Prophet) replied: The water-skins the\\n\\t\\t\\tmouths of which are tied (with a string).  They (again) said:\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet of Allah, our land abounds in rats and water-skins cannot\\n\\t\\t\\tremain intact.

You should rather say: \"We hear and we obey, (we seek)\\n\\t\\t\\tThy forgiveness, our Lord!

Our Lord, punish us not if we forget or make a\\n\\t\\t\\tmistake.\"  (The Prophet said): Yes, our Lord! do not lay on us a\\n\\t\\t\\tburden as Thou didst lay on those before us. (The Prophet said:)\\n\\t\\t\\tYes, our Lord, impose not on us (burdens) which we have not the\\n\\t\\t\\tstrength to bear. (The Prophet said:) Yes, and pardon us and\\n\\t\\t\\tgrant us protection!

So the people\\n\\t\\t\\ttravelled (self-absorbed) without paying any heed to one another,\\n\\t\\t\\tand the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) also travelled\\n\\t\\t\\tuntil it was midnight. I was by his side. The Messenger of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him) began to doze and leaned (to one side) of his\\n\\t\\t\\tcamel. I came to him and I lent him support without awaking him\\n\\t\\t\\tuntil he sat upright on his mount. He continued to travel until a\\n\\t\\t\\tmajor part of the night was over and (he again) leaned (to one\\n\\t\\t\\tside) of his camel. I supported him without awaking him till he\\n\\t\\t\\tsat upright on his mount, and then travelled until it was nearly\\n\\t\\t\\tdawn. He (again) leaned more sharply than on the two earlier\\n\\t\\t\\toccasions and he was about to fall down. So I came to him and\\n\\t\\t\\tsupported him. He lifted his head and said: Who is this?  I said:\\n\\t\\t\\tIt is AbuQatadah.  He (the Holy Prophet again) said: For how long\\n\\t\\t\\thave you been travelling with me like this?  I said: I have been\\n\\t\\t\\ttravelling in this very state since midnight.  He said: May Allah\\n\\t\\t\\tprotect you, as you have protected His Apostle (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim) (from falling down). He continued: Do you see that we were\\n\\t\\t\\thidden from the people? and again said: Do you see anyone?  I\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: Here is a rider. I again said: Here is another rider, until\\n\\t\\t\\twe gathered together and we were seven riders. The Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah (peace be upon him) stepped off the highway, placed his\\n\\t\\t\\thead (for sleep and said): Guard for us our prayers. The\\n\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was the first to wake up\\n\\t\\t\\tand the rays of the sun were falling on his back. We rose,\\n\\t\\t\\tstartled.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: Ride on. So we rode on\\n\\t\\t\\tuntil the sun had (sufficiently) risen. He then came down from\\n\\t\\t\\this camel and called for a jug of water that I had with me. There\\n\\t\\t\\twas a little water in that. With it he performed an ablution that\\n\\t\\t\\twas less thorough as compared with his usual ablutions when some\\n\\t\\t\\tof the water was left over. He (the Holy Prophet) said to\\n\\t\\t\\tAbuQatadah: Keep a watch over your jug of water; it will be on (a\\n\\t\\t\\tmiraculous) condition. Then Bilal summoned (people) to prayer.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) observed two rak'ahs\\n\\t\\t\\tand then said the morning prayer as he said it every day. The\\n\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah (peace be upon him) (then) rode on. We rode\\n\\t\\t\\twith him and some of us whispered to the others, saying: How will\\n\\t\\t\\tthere be compensation for omission in our prayers? Upon this he\\n\\t\\t\\t(the Apostle of Allah) said: Is there not in my (my life) a model\\n\\t\\t\\tfor you? There is no omission in sleeping. The (cognizable)\\n\\t\\t\\tomission is that one does not say prayer (intentionally) until\\n\\t\\t\\tthe time of the next prayer comes. So he who does thus (omits\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer in sleep or due to other unavoidable circumstances) should\\n\\t\\t\\tsay prayer when he becomes aware of it and on the next day he\\n\\t\\t\\tshould observe it at its prescribed time. He (the Holy Prophet)\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: What do you think the people would have done (at this\\n\\t\\t\\thour)? They would have found in the morning that their Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\twas missing from amongst them and then AbuBakr and Umar would\\n\\t\\t\\thave told them that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)\\n\\t\\t\\tmust be behind them, he could not leave them behind (him), but\\n\\t\\t\\tthe people would have said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim) is ahead of you. So if you had obeyed AbuBakr and Umar, you\\n\\t\\t\\twould have gone on the right path. So we proceeded until we came\\n\\t\\t\\tup to the people (behind whom we had been lagging). The day had\\n\\t\\t\\tadvanced considerably risen and everything became hot. They (the\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanions of the Holy Prophet) said: Messenger of Allah, we are\\n\\t\\t\\tdying of thirst. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) remarked: There\\n\\t\\t\\tis no destruction for you. And again said: Bring the small cup of\\n\\t\\t\\tmine; and then he asked for the jug of water to be brought to\\n\\t\\t\\thim. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) began to pour\\n\\t\\t\\twater (into that small cup) and AbuQatadah gave it to them to\\n\\t\\t\\tdrink. When the people saw that there was (a little) water in the\\n\\t\\t\\tjug, they fell upon it.  Upon this the Messenger of Allah (peace\\n\\t\\t\\tbe upon him) said: Behave well; the water (is enough) to satisfy\\n\\t\\t\\tall of you. Then they (the companions) began to receive (their\\n\\t\\t\\tshare of) water with calmness (without showing any anxiety). The\\n\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah (peace be upon him) continued to fill (the\\n\\t\\t\\tcup) and I continued to serve them until no one was left except\\n\\t\\t\\tmyself and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).\\tHe then\\n\\t\\t\\tfilled (the cup) with water and said to me: Drink it.  I said:\\n\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah, I should not drink until you have drunk. \\n\\t\\t\\tUpon this he said: The server of the people is the last of them\\n\\t\\t\\tto drink. So I drank and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim) also drank and the people came to the watering-place quite\\n\\t\\t\\thappy and satisfied. Abdullah ibn Rabah said: I am going to\\n\\t\\t\\tnarrate this hadith in the great mosque, when Imran ibn Husayn\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: See, O young man, how will you narrate it for I was also\\n\\t\\t\\tone of the riders that night?

I said: I am one of the\\n\\t\\t\\tAnsar.\\tUpon this he said: You narrate it, for you know your\\n\\t\\t\\thadith better. I therefore narrated it to the people.

When he\\n\\t\\t\\tcame to Medina he met the people of Medina. They dissuaded him\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom doing such a thing, and informed him that a group of six men\\n\\t\\t\\thad decided to do so during the lifetime of the Apostle of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him) and the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him)\\n\\t\\t\\tforbade them to do it.\\tHe had said: Is there not for you a model\\n\\t\\t\\tpattern in me? When they narrated this to him (Sa'd ibn Hisham),\\n\\t\\t\\the returned to his wife, though he had divorced her and made\\n\\t\\t\\t(people) witness to his reconciliation. He then came to Ibn Abbas\\n\\t\\t\\tand asked him about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\tupon him).  Ibn Abbas said: Should I not lead you to one who\\n\\t\\t\\tknows best amongst the people of the world about the Witr of the\\n\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah? He said: Who is it?  (Ibn Abbas) said: It is\\n\\t\\t\\tAisha. So go to her and ask her (about Witr) and then come to me\\n\\t\\t\\tand inform me of the answer that she gives you. So I came to\\n\\t\\t\\tHakim ibn Aflah and requested him to take me to her.  He said: I\\n\\t\\t\\tshall not go to her, for I forbade her to say anything (about the\\n\\t\\t\\tconflict) between the two groups, but she refused (to accept my\\n\\t\\t\\tadvice) and went (to participate in the conflict). I (requested)\\n\\t\\t\\thim (Hakim) with an oath to lead me to her. So we went to Aisha\\n\\t\\t\\tand we begged permission to meet her. She granted us permission\\n\\t\\t\\tand we went in.  She said: Are you Hakim? (She recognized him.) \\n\\t\\t\\tHe replied: Yes.  She said: Who is there with you?  He said: He\\n\\t\\t\\tis Sa'd ibn Hisham.  She said: Which Hisham? He said:  He is\\n\\t\\t\\tHisham ibn Amir. She blessed him (Amir) with mercy from Allah and\\n\\t\\t\\tspoke good of him (Qatadah said that he died as a martyr in\\n\\t\\t\\tUhud). I said: Mother of the Faithful, tell me about the\\n\\t\\t\\tcharacter of the Messenger of Allah.  She said: Don't you read\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Qur'an?  I said: Yes.  Upon this she said: The character of\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) was the Qur'an. He said:\\n\\t\\t\\tI felt inclined to stand up and not ask anything (further) until\\n\\t\\t\\tdeath. But then I changed my mind and said: Inform me about the\\n\\t\\t\\tobservance (of the night prayer) of the Messenger of Allah (peace\\n\\t\\t\\tbe upon him)  She said: Did you not recite: \"O thou wrapped up\"? \\n\\t\\t\\tHe said: Yes.  She said: Allah, the Exalted and the Glorious,\\n\\t\\t\\tmade the observance of the night prayer at the beginning of this\\n\\t\\t\\tSurah obligatory. So the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) and\\n\\t\\t\\this companions around him observed this (night prayer) for one\\n\\t\\t\\tyear. Allah held back the concluding portion of this Surah for\\n\\t\\t\\ttwelve months in Heaven until (at the end of this period) Allah\\n\\t\\t\\trevealed the concluding verses of this Surah, which lightened\\n\\t\\t\\t(the burden of this prayer), and the night prayer became a\\n\\t\\t\\tsupererogatory prayer after being an obligatory one. I said:\\n\\t\\t\\tMother of the Faithful, inform me about the Witr of the Messenger\\n\\t\\t\\tof Allah (peace be upon him).  She said: I used to prepare a\\n\\t\\t\\ttooth-stick for him and water for his ablution, and Allah would\\n\\t\\t\\trouse him to the extent He wished during the night. He would use\\n\\t\\t\\tthe tooth stick,  perform ablution, and would offer nine rak'ahs.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe would only sit for the eighth one and would remember Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\tpraise Him and supplicate Him, then he would stand up without\\n\\t\\t\\tuttering the salutation and pray the ninth rak'ah. He would then\\n\\t\\t\\tsit, remember Him, praise Him and supplicate Him and then utter a\\n\\t\\t\\tsalutation loud enough for us to hear. He would then pray two\\n\\t\\t\\trak'ahs sitting after uttering the salutation, and that made\\n\\t\\t\\televen rak'ahs.  However, my son, when the Apostle of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him) grew old and put on flesh, he observed a Witr\\n\\t\\t\\tof seven, doing in two rak'ahs as he had done formerly, and that\\n\\t\\t\\tmade nine. O my son, when the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim) observed prayer, he liked to continue observing it, and when\\n\\t\\t\\tsleep or pain overpowered him and made it impossible (for him) to\\n\\t\\t\\tobserve prayer at night, he prayed twelve rak'ahs during the day.\\n\\t\\t\\tI am not aware of Allah's Prophet (peace be upon him) having\\n\\t\\t\\trecited the whole Qur'an during one single night, or praying\\n\\t\\t\\tthrough the night till morning, or fasting a complete month,\\n\\t\\t\\texcept Ramadan. He (narrator) said: I then went to Ibn Abbas and\\n\\t\\t\\tnarrated to him the hadith (transmitted from her), and he said:\\n\\t\\t\\tShe says the truth. If I went to her and were admitted into her\\n\\t\\t\\tpresence, I should have listened to it orally from her.

    "text": "<p>\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen I was in the state of Ignorance (before embracing Islam) I\\n\\t\\t\\tused to think that the people were in error; they were not on\\n\\t\\t\\tanything (that might be called the right path) and they\\n\\t\\t\\tworshipped idols. Meanwhile I heard of a man in Mecca who was\\n\\t\\t\\tgiving news (on the basis of his prophetic knowledge); so I\\n\\t\\t\\tmounted and rode to him. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim) was at that time hiding as his people had made life hard for\\n\\t\\t\\thim. I adopted a friendly attitude (towards the Meccans and thus\\n\\t\\t\\tmanaged) to enter Mecca and go to him (the Holy Prophet).  I said\\n\\t\\t\\tto him: Who are you?  He said: I am a Prophet (of Allah).  I\\n\\t\\t\\tagain said: What is a Prophet?\\tHe said: (I am a Prophet in the\\n\\t\\t\\tsense that) I have been sent by Allah.\\tI said: What have you\\n\\t\\t\\tbeen sent to do?  He said: I have been sent to join ties of\\n\\t\\t\\trelationship (with kindness and affection), to break the idols,\\n\\t\\t\\tand to proclaim the oneness of Allah (in a manner that) nothing\\n\\t\\t\\tis to be associated with Him.  I said: Who is with you in this\\n\\t\\t\\t(in these beliefs and practices)? He said: A free man and a\\n\\t\\t\\tslave.\\tHe (the narrator) said: AbuBakr and Bilal were there with\\n\\t\\t\\thim among those who had embraced Islam by that time.  I said: It\\n\\t\\t\\tintend to follow you.  He said: During these days you will not be\\n\\t\\t\\table to do so. Don't you see the (hard) conditions under which I\\n\\t\\t\\tand (my) people are living? You had better go back to your people\\n\\t\\t\\tand when you hear that I have been granted victory, you come to\\n\\t\\t\\tme.  So I went to my family. I was in my home when the Messenger\\n\\t\\t\\tof Allah (peace be upon him) came to Medina. I was among my\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople and used to seek news and ask people when he arrived in\\n\\t\\t\\tMedina. Then a group of people belonging to Yathrib (Medina)\\n\\t\\t\\tcame.  I said (to them): How is that person, who has come to\\n\\t\\t\\tMedina, faring?  They said: The people are hastening to him,\\n\\t\\t\\twhile his people (the polytheists of Mecca) planned to kill him\\n\\t\\t\\tbut they could not do so.  I (on hearing it) came to Medina and\\n\\t\\t\\twent to him and said: Messenger of Allah, do you recognize me? \\n\\t\\t\\tHe said: Yes, you are the same man who met me at Mecca.  I said:\\n\\t\\t\\tIt is so.  I again said: Prophet of Allah, tell me that which\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah has taught you and which I do not know, tell me about the\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer.  He said: Observe the dawn prayer, then stop praying when\\n\\t\\t\\tthe sun is rising until it is fully ,risen for when it rises it\\n\\t\\t\\tcomes up between the horns of Satan, and the unbelievers\\n\\t\\t\\tprostrate themselves to it at that time. Then pray, for the\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer is witnessed and attended (by angels) until the shadow\\n\\t\\t\\tbecomes about the length of a lance; then cease prayer, for at\\n\\t\\t\\tthat time Hell is heated up. Then when the shadow moves forward,\\n\\t\\t\\tpray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended by angels, until\\n\\t\\t\\tyou pray the afternoon prayer. Then cease prayer until the sun\\n\\t\\t\\tsets, for it sets between the horns of the Devil, and at that\\n\\t\\t\\ttime the unbelievers prostrate themselves before it.  I said:\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle of Allah, tell me about ablution also.\\tHe said: He who\\n\\t\\t\\tuses water for ablution, rinses his mouth, snuffs up water and\\n\\t\\t\\tblows it out, the sins of his face, his mouth and his nostrils\\n\\t\\t\\twill be washed away. When he washes his face, as Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\tcommanded him, the sins of his face are carried away from the end\\n\\t\\t\\tof his beard with the water. Then (when) he washes his forearms\\n\\t\\t\\tup to the elbows, the sins of his arms are carried away with the\\n\\t\\t\\twater from his finger-tips. When he wipes his head, the sins of\\n\\t\\t\\this head are carried away from the ends of his hair with the\\n\\t\\t\\twater. And (when) he washes his feet up to the ankles, the sins\\n\\t\\t\\tof his feet are carried away from his toes with the water. And if\\n\\t\\t\\the stands to pray and praises Allah, lauds Him, glorifies Him\\n\\t\\t\\twith what becomes Him and shows wholehearted devotion to Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\this sins will depart, leaving him (as innocent) as he was on the\\n\\t\\t\\tday his mother bore him.  Amr ibn Abasah narrated this hadith to\\n\\t\\t\\tAbuUmamah, a companion of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim), and AbuUmamah said to him: Amr ibn Abasah, think of what\\n\\t\\t\\tyou are saying; that such (a great reward) is given to a man in\\n\\t\\t\\tone place (only in the act of ablution and prayer).  Upon this\\n\\t\\t\\tAmr said: AbuUmamah, I have grown old my bones have become weak\\n\\t\\t\\tand I am at death's door; what reason is there for me to\\n\\t\\t\\tattribute a lie to Allah and the Messenger of Allah (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\tupon him)? Had I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\tupon him) once, twice, or three times (even seven times), I\\n\\t\\t\\tshould have never narrated it, but I have heard it from him on\\n\\t\\t\\tmore occasions than these.\\n\\t\\t</p>"

    "text": "<p>\\n\\t\\t\\tJa'far ibn Muhammad reported on the authority of his father: We\\n\\t\\t\\twent to Jabir ibn Abdullah and he began inquiring about the\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople (who had gone to see him) till it was my turn. I said: I\\n\\t\\t\\tam Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Husayn. He placed his hand upon my head\\n\\t\\t\\tand opened my upper button and then the lower one and then placed\\n\\t\\t\\this palm on my chest (in order to bless me), and I was, during\\n\\t\\t\\tthose days, a young boy, and he said: You are welcome, my nephew.\\n\\t\\t\\tAsk whatever you want to ask. And I asked him but as he was blind\\n\\t\\t\\t(he could not respond to me immediately), and the time for prayer\\n\\t\\t\\tcame. He stood up covering himself in his mantle. And whenever he\\n\\t\\t\\tplaced its ends upon his shoulders they slipped down on account\\n\\t\\t\\tof being short (in size). Another mantle was, however, lying on\\n\\t\\t\\tthe clothes rack near by and he led us in the prayer.  I said to\\n\\t\\t\\thim: Tell me about the Hajj of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim) stayed in (Medina) for nine years but did not perform Hajj,\\n\\t\\t\\tthen he made a public announcement in the tenth year to the\\n\\t\\t\\teffect that Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) was about to\\n\\t\\t\\tperform the Hajj. A large number of persons came to Medina and\\n\\t\\t\\tall of them were anxious to follow the Messenger of Allah (peace\\n\\t\\t\\tbe upon him) and do according to his doing. We set out with him\\n\\t\\t\\ttill we reached Dhul-Hulayfah. Asma daughter of Umays gave birth\\n\\t\\t\\tto Muhammad ibn AbuBakr. She sent message to the Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah (peace be upon him) asking him: What should I do? He (the\\n\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet) said: Take a bath, bandage your private parts and\\n\\t\\t\\tput on Ihram. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be Upon him) then\\n\\t\\t\\tprayed in the mosque and then mounted al-Qaswa (his she-camel)\\n\\t\\t\\tand it stood erect with him on its back at al-Bayda'.  And I saw\\n\\t\\t\\tas far as I could see in front of me but riders and pedestrians,\\n\\t\\t\\tand also on my right and on my left and behind me like this. And\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Messenger of Allah (may peace be him) was prominent among us\\n\\t\\t\\tand the (revelation) of the Holy Qur'an was descending upon him.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd it is he who knows (its true) significance. And whatever he\\n\\t\\t\\tdid, we also did that. He pronounced the Oneness of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t(saying): \"Labbayk, O Allah, Labbayk, Labbayk, Thou hast no\\n\\t\\t\\tpartner, praise and grace is Thine and the Sovereignty too; Thou\\n\\t\\t\\thast no partner.\" And the people also pronounced this Talbiyah\\n\\t\\t\\twhich they pronounce (today). The Messenger of Allah (my peace be\\n\\t\\t\\tupon him) did not reject anything out of it. But the Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah (peace be upon him) adhered to his own Talbiyah.\\tJabir\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: We did not have any other intention but that of Hajj only,\\n\\t\\t\\tbeing unaware of the Umrah (at that season), but when we came\\n\\t\\t\\twith him to the House, he touched the pillar, and (made seven\\n\\t\\t\\tcircuits) running three of them and walking four. And then going\\n\\t\\t\\tto the Station of Ibrahim, he rejected: \"And adopt the Station of\\n\\t\\t\\tIbrahim as a place of prayer.\" And this Station was between him\\n\\t\\t\\tand the House. My father said (and I do not know whether he had\\n\\t\\t\\tmade a mention of it but that was from Allah's Apostle (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\tupon him) that he recited in two rak'ahs: \"say: He is Allah One,\\n\\t\\t\\t\" and say: \"Say : O unbelievers.\" He then returned to the pillar\\n\\t\\t\\t(Hajar Aswad) and kissed it. He then went out of the gate to\\n\\t\\t\\tas-Safa and as he reached near it he recited: \"As-Safa and\\n\\t\\t\\tal-Marwah are among the signs appointed by Allah, (adding:) I\\n\\t\\t\\tbegin with what Allah (has commanded me) to begin. He first\\n\\t\\t\\tmounted as-Safa' till he saw the House, and facing Qiblah he\\n\\t\\t\\tdeclared the Oneness of Allah and glorified Him, and said: \"There\\n\\t\\t\\tis no god but Allah, One, there is no partner with Him. His is\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Sovereignty, to Him praise is due, and He is Powerful over\\n\\t\\t\\teverything. There is no god but Allah alone, Who fulfilled His\\n\\t\\t\\tpromise, helped His servant and routed the confederates alone.\"\\n\\t\\t\\tHe then made supplication in the course of that saying such words\\n\\t\\t\\tthree times. He then descended and walked towards al-Marwah, and\\n\\t\\t\\twhen his feet came down in the bottom of the valley, he ran, and\\n\\t\\t\\twhen he began to ascend he walked till he reached al-Marwah.\\n\\t\\t\\tThere he did as he had done at as-Safa.  And when it was his last\\n\\t\\t\\trunning at al-Marwah he said: If I had know beforehand what I\\n\\t\\t\\thave come to know afterwards, I would not have brought\\n\\t\\t\\tsacrificial animals and would have performed an Umrah. So, he who\\n\\t\\t\\tamong you has not the sacrificial animals with him should put off\\n\\t\\t\\tIhram and treat it as an Umrah. Suraqah ibn Malik ibn Ju'sham got\\n\\t\\t\\tup and said: Messenger of Allah, does it apply to the present\\n\\t\\t\\tyear, or does it apply for ever? Thereupon the Messenger of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him) intertwined the fingers (of one hand) into\\n\\t\\t\\tanother and said twice: The `Umrah has become incorporated in the\\n\\t\\t\\tHajj (adding): \"No, but for ever and ever.\"  Ali came from the\\n\\t\\t\\tYemen with the sacrificial animals for the Prophet (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim) and found Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her) to be one\\n\\t\\t\\tamong those who had put off Ihram and had put on dyed clothes and\\n\\t\\t\\thad applied antimony. He (Ali) showed disapproval to it,\\n\\t\\t\\twhereupon she said: My father has commanded me to do this. (The\\n\\t\\t\\tnarrator) said that Ali said that Ali used to say in Iraq: I went\\n\\t\\t\\tto the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) showing annoyance\\n\\t\\t\\tat Fatimah for what she had done, and asked the (verdict) of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Messenger (peace be upon him) regarding what she had\\n\\t\\t\\tnarrated from him, and told him that I was angry with her,\\n\\t\\t\\twhereupon` he said: She has told the truth, she has told the\\n\\t\\t\\ttruth.\\t(The Holy Prophet then asked Ali): What did you say when\\n\\t\\t\\tyou undertook to go for Hajj? I (Ali) said: O Allah, I am putting\\n\\t\\t\\ton Ihram for the same purpose as Thy Messenger has put it on. He\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: I have with me sacrificial animals, so do not put off the\\n\\t\\t\\tIhram. He (Jabir) said: The total number of those sacrificial\\n\\t\\t\\tanimals brought by Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle (peace be upon him) was one hundred. Then all the people\\n\\t\\t\\texcept the Apostle (peace be upon him) and those who had with\\n\\t\\t\\tthem sacrificial animals, put off Ihram, and got their hair\\n\\t\\t\\tclipped; when it was the day of Tarwiyah (8th of Dhul-Hijjah)\\n\\t\\t\\tthey went to Mina and put on the Ihram for Hajj and the Messenger\\n\\t\\t\\tof Allah (peace be upon him) rode and led the noon, afternoon,\\n\\t\\t\\tsunset Isha' and dawn prayers. He then waited a little till the\\n\\t\\t\\tsun rose, and commanded that a tent of hair should be pitched at\\n\\t\\t\\tNamirah. \\n\\t\\t</p>"

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), however,\\n\\t\\t\\tpassed on till he came to Arafat and he found that the tent had\\n\\t\\t\\tbeen pitched for him at Namirah. There he got down till the sun\\n\\t\\t\\thad passed the meridian; he commanded that al-Qaswa should be\\n\\t\\t\\tbrought and saddled for him.  Then he came to the bottom of the\\n\\t\\t\\tvalley, and addressed the people saying: Verily your blood, your\\n\\t\\t\\tproperty are as sacred and inviolable as the sacredness of this\\n\\t\\t\\tday of yours, in this month of yours, in this town of yours,\\n\\t\\t\\tBehold! Everything pertaining to the Days of Ignorance is under\\n\\t\\t\\tmy feet completely abolished. Abolished are also the\\n\\t\\t\\tblood-revenges of the Days of Ignorance. The first claim of ours\\n\\t\\t\\ton blood-revenge which I abolish is that of the son of Rabi'ah\\n\\t\\t\\tibn al-Harith, who was nursed among the tribe of Sa'd and killed\\n\\t\\t\\tby Hudhayl. And the usury of she pre-Islamic period is abolished,\\n\\t\\t\\tand the first of our usury I abolished is that of Abbas ibn\\n\\t\\t\\tAbdulMuttalib, for it is all abolished.  Fear Allah concerning\\n\\t\\t\\twomen! Verily you have taken them on the security of Allah, and\\n\\t\\t\\tintercourse with them has been made lawful unto you by words of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah. You too have right over them, and that they should not\\n\\t\\t\\tallow anyone to sit on your bed whom you do not like. But if they\\n\\t\\t\\tdo that, you can chastise them but not severely. Their right upon\\n\\t\\t\\tyou are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a\\n\\t\\t\\tfitting manner. I have left among you the Book of Allah, and if\\n\\t\\t\\tyou hold fast to it, you would never go astray.  And you would be\\n\\t\\t\\tasked about me (on the Day of Resurrection), (now tell me) what\\n\\t\\t\\twould you say? They (the audience) said: We will bear witness\\n\\t\\t\\tthat you have conveyed (the message), discharged (the ministry of\\n\\t\\t\\tProphethood) and given wise (sincere) counsel. He (the narrator)\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: He (the Holy Prophet) then raised his forefinger towards\\n\\t\\t\\tthe sky and pointing it at the people (said): \"O Allah, be\\n\\t\\t\\twitness. O Allah be witness,\" saying it thrice (Bilal then)\\n\\t\\t\\tpronounced Adhan and later on Iqamah and he (the Holy Prophet)\\n\\t\\t\\tled the noon prayer. He (Bilal) then uttered Iqamah and he (the\\n\\t\\t\\tHoly Prophet) led the afternoon prayer and he observed no other\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer in between the two.  The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim) then mounted his camel and came to the place of stay, making\\n\\t\\t\\this she-camel al-Qaswa turn towards the side where there were\\n\\t\\t\\trocks, having the path taken by those who went on foot in front\\n\\t\\t\\tof him, and faced the Qiblah. He kept standing there till the sun\\n\\t\\t\\tset, and the yellow light had somewhat gone, and the disc of the\\n\\t\\t\\tsun had disappeared. He made Usamah sit behind him, and he pulled\\n\\t\\t\\tthe nose-string of Qaswa so forcefully that its head touched the\\n\\t\\t\\tsaddle (in order to keep her under perfect control), and he\\n\\t\\t\\tpointed out to the people with his right hand to be moderate (in\\n\\t\\t\\tspeed), and whenever he happened to pass over in elevated tract\\n\\t\\t\\tof sand, he slightly loosened it (the nose-string of his camel)\\n\\t\\t\\ttill she climbed up and this is how he reached al-Muzdalifah. \\n\\t\\t\\tThere he led the evening and Isha prayers with one Adhan and two\\n\\t\\t\\tIqamahs and did not glorify (Allah) in between them (i.e. he did\\n\\t\\t\\tnot observe supererogatory rak'ahs between Maghrib and Isha\\n\\t\\t\\tprayers). The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) then lay\\n\\t\\t\\tdown till dawn and offered the dawn prayer with an Adhan and\\n\\t\\t\\tIqamah when the morning light was clear. He again mounted\\n\\t\\t\\tal-Qaswa, and when he came to al-Mash'ar al-Haram, he faced\\n\\t\\t\\ttowards Qiblah, supplicated Him, Glorified Him, and pronounced\\n\\t\\t\\tHis Uniqueness (La ilaha illallah) and Oneness, and kept standing\\n\\t\\t\\ttill the daylight was very clear.  He then went quickly before\\n\\t\\t\\tthe sun rose, and seated behind him was al-Fadl ibn Abbas, and he\\n\\t\\t\\twas a man having beautiful hair and fair complexion and handsome\\n\\t\\t\\tface. As the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was moving\\n\\t\\t\\ton, there was also going a group of women (side with them).\\n\\t\\t\\tAl-Fadl began to look at them. The Messenger of Allah (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\tupon him) placed his hand on the face of Fadl who then turned his\\n\\t\\t\\tface to the other side, and began to see, and the Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah (peace be upon him) turned his hand to the other side and\\n\\t\\t\\tplaced it on the face of al-Fadl. He again turned his face to the\\n\\t\\t\\tother side till he came to the bottom of Muhassir. He urged her\\n\\t\\t\\t(al-Qaswa) a little, and, following the middle road, which comes\\n\\t\\t\\tout at the greatest Jamrah, he came to the Jamrah which is near\\n\\t\\t\\tthe tree. At this he threw seven small pebbles, saying\\n\\t\\t\\tAllahuAkbar while throwing every one of them in manner in which\\n\\t\\t\\tthe small pebbles are thrown (with the help of fingers) and this\\n\\t\\t\\the did in the bottom of the valley.  He then went to the place of\\n\\t\\t\\tsacrifice, and sacrificed sixty-three (camels) with his won hand.\\n\\t\\t\\tThen he gave the remaining number to Ali who sacrificed them, and\\n\\t\\t\\the shared him in his sacrifice. He then commanded that a piece of\\n\\t\\t\\tflesh from each animal sacrificed should be put in a pot, and\\n\\t\\t\\twhen it was cooked, both of them (the Holy Prophet and Ali) took\\n\\t\\t\\tsome meat out of it and drank its soup. The Messenger of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him again rode and came to the House, and offered\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Zuhr prayer at Mecca. He came to the tribe of AbdulMuttalib,\\n\\t\\t\\twho were supplying water at Zamzam, and said: Draw water, O Banu\\n\\t\\t\\tAbdulMuttalib; were it not that people would usurp this right of\\n\\t\\t\\tsupplying water from you, I would have drawn it along with you.\\n\\t\\t\\tSo they handed him a basket and he drank from it. \\n\\t\\t</p>"

Thereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, how ill she\\n\\t\\t\\trewarded it by vowing to Allah that if He saved her on its back,\\n\\t\\t\\tshe would sacrifice it! There is no fulfilment of the vow in an\\n\\t\\t\\tact of disobedience, nor in an act over which a person has no\\n\\t\\t\\tcontrol.

There were\\n\\t\\t\\tfifty goats with us which could not be watered (by the small\\n\\t\\t\\tquantity of water in the local well). So, the Messenger of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him) sat on the brink of the well. Either he\\n\\t\\t\\tprayed or spat into the well. The water welled up. We drank and\\n\\t\\t\\twatered (the beasts as well). Then the Messenger of Allah (may\\n\\t\\t\\tpeace be upon  him) called us to take the vow of allegiance, as\\n\\t\\t\\the was sitting at the base of a tree. I was the first man to take\\n\\t\\t\\tthe oath. Then other people took the oath. When half the number\\n\\t\\t\\tof people had done so, he said to me: You take the oath, Salamah.\\n\\t\\t\\tI said: I was one of those who took the vow in the first\\n\\t\\t\\tinstance. He said: (you may do) again. Then the Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah (peace be upon him) saw that I was without weapons. He gave\\n\\t\\t\\tme a big or a small shield. Then he continued to administer vows\\n\\t\\t\\tto the people until it was the last batch of them. He said (to\\n\\t\\t\\tme): Won't you swear allegiance, Salamah? I said: Messenger of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah, I took the oath with the first batch of the people and\\n\\t\\t\\tthen again when you were in the middle of the people. He said:\\n\\t\\t\\t(Doesn't matter), you may (do so) again. So I took the oath of\\n\\t\\t\\tallegiance thrice. Then he said to me: Salamah, where is the\\n\\t\\t\\tshield which I gave to thee? I said: Messenger of Allah,  my\\n\\t\\t\\tuncle Amir met me and he was without any weapons. So I gave the\\n\\t\\t\\tshield to him. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) laughed\\n\\t\\t\\tand said: You are like a person of the days gone by who said: O\\n\\t\\t\\tGod, I seek a friend who is dearer to me than myself. (When all\\n\\t\\t\\tCompanions had sworn allegiance to the Holy Prophet), the\\n\\t\\t\\tpolytheists sent messages of peace, until people could move from\\n\\t\\t\\tour camp to that of the Meccans and vice versa. Finally, the\\n\\t\\t\\tpeace treaty was concluded. I was a dependant of Talhah bin\\n\\t\\t\\tUbaydullah. I watered his horse and rubbed its back.  I served\\n\\t\\t\\tTalhah (doing odd jobs for him) and partook from his food. I had\\n\\t\\t\\tleft my  family and my property as an emigrant in the cause of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah and His Messenger (peace be upon him). When we and the\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople of Mecca had concluded a peace treaty  and the people of\\n\\t\\t\\tone side began to mix with those of the other, I came to a tree,\\n\\t\\t\\tswept away its thorns and lay down (for rest) at its base. (While\\n\\t\\t\\tI lay there), four of the polytheists from the Meccans came to me\\n\\t\\t\\tand began to talk ill of the Messenger of  Allah (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim). I got enraged with them and moved to another tree. They\\n\\t\\t\\thung their weapons (to the branches of the trees) and lay down\\n\\t\\t\\t(for rest). (While they lay there), somebody from the lower part\\n\\t\\t\\tof the valley cried out: Run up, O Muhajirs! Ibn Zunaym has been\\n\\t\\t\\tmurdered. I drew my sword and attacked these four while they were\\n\\t\\t\\tasleep. I seized their arms and collected them up in my hand, and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: By the Being Who has conferred honour upon Muhammad, none\\n\\t\\t\\tof you shall raise his head, else I will smite his face. (Then) I\\n\\t\\t\\tcame driving them along to the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him).\\n\\t\\t\\t(At the same time), my uncle Amir came (to him) with a man from\\n\\t\\t\\tAbalat called Mikraz. Amir was dragging him on a horse with a\\n\\t\\t\\tthick covering on its back along with seventy polytheists. The\\n\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah (peace be upon him) cast a glance at them and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: Let them go (so that) they may prove guilty of breach of\\n\\t\\t\\ttrust more than once (before we take action against them). So the\\n\\t\\t\\tMessenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forgave them. On this\\n\\t\\t\\toccasion, God revealed the Qur'anic verse: \"It is He Who\\n\\t\\t\\trestrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the\\n\\t\\t\\tvalley of Mecca after He has granted you a victory over them\"\\n\\t\\t\\t(xiviii.24).  Then we started moving back to Medina, and halted\\n\\t\\t\\tat a place  where there was a mountain between us and Banu Libyan\\n\\t\\t\\twho were polytheists. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)\\n\\t\\t\\tasked God's forgiveness for one who ascended the mountain at\\n\\t\\t\\tnight to act as a scout for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim) and his Companions.

Then I stood upon a\\n\\t\\t\\thillock and turning my face to Medina, shouted thrice: Come to\\n\\t\\t\\tour help! Then I set out in pursuit of the raiders, shooting at\\n\\t\\t\\tthem with arrows and chanting a (self-eulogising) verse in the\\n\\t\\t\\tIambic meter:  I am the son of al-Akwa' And today is the day of\\n\\t\\t\\tdefeat for the mean.

By God, I continued shooting at them and\\n\\t\\t\\thamstringing their animals. Whenever a horseman turned upon me, I\\n\\t\\t\\twould come to a tree and (hid myself) sitting at its base. Then I\\n\\t\\t\\twould shoot at him and hamstring his horse. (At last) they\\n\\t\\t\\tentered a narrow mountain gorge.

They left me; then I followed them shooting at them\\n\\t\\t\\t(continually) until they dropped more than thirty mantles and\\n\\t\\t\\tthirty lances, lightening their burden. On everything they\\n\\t\\t\\tdropped, I put a mark with the help of (a piece of) stone so that\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and his Companions\\n\\t\\t\\tmight recognise them (that it was booty left by the enemy). (They\\n\\t\\t\\twent on) until they came to a narrow valley when so and so, son\\n\\t\\t\\tof Badr al-Fazari joined them. They (now), sat down to take their\\n\\t\\t\\tbreakfast and I sat on the top of a tapering rock. Al-Fazari\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: Who is that fellow I am seeing? They said: This fellow has\\n\\t\\t\\tharassed us. By God, he has not left us since dusk and has been\\n\\t\\t\\t(continually) shooting at us until he has snatched everything\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom our hands. He said: Four of you should make a dash at him\\n\\t\\t\\t(and kill him).  (Accordingly), four of them ascended the\\n\\t\\t\\tmountain coming towards me. When it became possible for me to\\n\\t\\t\\ttalk to them, I said: Do you recognise me? They said: No. Who art\\n\\t\\t\\tthou? I said: I am Salamah, son of al-Akwa'.

I did\\n\\t\\t\\tnot move from my place until I saw the horsemen of the Messenger\\n\\t\\t\\tof Allah (peace be upon him), who came riding through the trees.\\n\\t\\t\\tLo! the foremost among them was Akhram al-Asadi. Behind him was\\n\\t\\t\\tAbuQatadah al-Ansari and behind him was al-Miqdad bin al-Aswad\\n\\t\\t\\tal-Kindi.  I caught hold of the rein of Akhram's horse.

He said: O Salamah, if you believe in Allah and the Day\\n\\t\\t\\tof Judgment and (if) you know that Paradise is a reality and Hell\\n\\t\\t\\tis a reality, you should not stand between me and martyrdom. So I\\n\\t\\t\\tlet him go. Akhram and AbdurRahman (Fazari) met in combat. Akhram\\n\\t\\t\\thamstrung AbdurRahman's horse and the latter struck him with his\\n\\t\\t\\tlance and killed him. AbdurRahman turned about riding Akhram's\\n\\t\\t\\thorse. AbuQatadah, a horseman of the Messenger of Allah (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\tupon him), met AbdurRahman (in combat), smote him with his lance\\n\\t\\t\\tand killed him. By the Being Who honoured the countenance of\\n\\t\\t\\tMuhammad (peace be upon him), I followed them running on my feet\\n\\t\\t\\t(so fast) that I couldn't see behind me the Companions of\\n\\t\\t\\tMuhammad (peace be upon him), nor any dust raised by their\\n\\t\\t\\thorses. (I followed them) until before sunset they reached a\\n\\t\\t\\tvalley which had a spring of water, which was called Dhu Qarad,\\n\\t\\t\\tso that they could have a drink, for they were thirsty. They saw\\n\\t\\t\\tme running towards them. I turned them out of the valley before\\n\\t\\t\\tthey could drink a drop of its water. They left the valley and\\n\\t\\t\\tran down a slope.

We presented ourselves (as\\n\\t\\t\\tguests) to the companions of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim), but none amongst them would entertain us.  So we came to\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle (peace be upon him), and he took us to his\\n\\t\\t\\tresidence and there were three goats.  Allah's Apostle (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\tupon him) said: Milk these for us. So we milked them and each one\\n\\t\\t\\tof us drank his share and we set aside the share of Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle (peace be upon him). (It was his habit) to come during\\n\\t\\t\\tthe night and greet (the people present there) in a manner that\\n\\t\\t\\twould not wake up one who was asleep but make one who was awake\\n\\t\\t\\thear it. He would then go to the mosque and say prayers, then go\\n\\t\\t\\tto the milk and drink it. Miqdad added: One night Satan came to\\n\\t\\t\\tme when I had taken my share, and he said: Muhammad has gone to\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Ansar who will offer him hospitality and he will share what\\n\\t\\t\\tthey have them, he has no need this draught (of milk).\\tSo I took\\n\\t\\t\\t(that milk) and drank it, and when it had penetrated my stomach\\n\\t\\t\\tand I was certain that there was no way out (but to digest it),\\n\\t\\t\\tSatan aroused (my sense of) remorse and said: Woe be to thee!\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat have you done? You have taken the drink reserved for\\n\\t\\t\\tMuhammad! When he comes and back not find it, he will curse you.\\n\\t\\t\\tYou will be ruined, and thus This world and the hereafter will be\\n\\t\\t\\tlost you. There was a sheet over me; as I pulled it my feet, my\\n\\t\\t\\thead was uncovered, and as I pulled it over my head, my feet were\\n\\t\\t\\tuncovered. I could not sleep, but my two companions had gone to\\n\\t\\t\\tsleep for they had not done what I had done. There came Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle (peace be upon him) and he greeted us in his usual way\\n\\t\\t\\t(by saying As-salamu Alaykum). He came to the mosque and observed\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer, and then came to his drink (milk) and uncovered it but\\n\\t\\t\\tdid not find anything in it. He raised his head towards the sky,\\n\\t\\t\\tand I said (to myself) that he (the Holy Prophet) was going to\\n\\t\\t\\tinvoke curses upon me and I should be thus ruined.  He (the Holy\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet) said: Allah, feed him who fed me and give drink to him\\n\\t\\t\\twho provided me with drink. I held tight the sheet upon myself\\n\\t\\t\\t(and when he had supplicated), I took hold of the knife and went\\n\\t\\t\\tto the goats (possessed by the Holy Prophet) so that I may\\n\\t\\t\\tslaughter the fattest among them for Allah's Messenger (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\tupon him). In fact all of them were milking goats. So I took hold\\n\\t\\t\\tof the vessel which belonged to the family of Allah's Messenger\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him), in which they used to milk and drink\\n\\t\\t\\ttherefrom, and milked them in that until it was full of frothy\\n\\t\\t\\tmilk.  I came to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and he\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: Have you taken your share of the milk during the night?  I\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: Drink it, and he drank it. He then handed over (the vessel)\\n\\t\\t\\tto me and I said: Allah's Messenger, drink it. He drank it and\\n\\t\\t\\thanded over (the vessel) to me again. I then perceived that\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle (peace be upon him) was satisfied and I had\\n\\t\\t\\treceived his blessings.  I burst out laughing so hard that I fell\\n\\t\\t\\tupon the ground, whereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him)\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: Miqdad, it must be one of your mischiefs. I said: Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tMessenger, this affair of mine is like this and this, and I have\\n\\t\\t\\tdone so.  Thereupon, Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said:\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is nothing but a mercy from Allah. Why did you not give me\\n\\t\\t\\tan opportunity to awaken our two friends and they would have\\n\\t\\t\\treceived their share (of the milk)?

She sought permission to come in as\\n\\t\\t\\the had been lying with me in my mantle.

She (Aisha) said: I kept quiet.\\n\\t\\t\\tThereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said to her\\n\\t\\t\\t(Fatimah): O daughter, don't you love whom I love?  She said:\\n\\t\\t\\tYes, (I do).  Thereupon he said: I love this one.

Aisha (further) reported: The wives of Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle (peace be upon him) then sent Zaynab bint Jahsh, the wife\\n\\t\\t\\tof Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him), and she was one who was\\n\\t\\t\\tsomewhat equal in rank with me in the eyes of Allah's Messenger\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him).

Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tMessenger (peace be upon him) permitted her to enter as she\\n\\t\\t\\t(Aisha) was there with Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) in\\n\\t\\t\\ther mantle, in the same very state as when Fatimah had entered. \\n\\t\\t\\tShe said: Allah's Messenger, your wives have sent me to you,\\n\\t\\t\\tseeking equity in the case of the daughter of AbuQuhafah. She\\n\\t\\t\\tthen came to me and  showed harshness to me I looked at the eyes\\n\\t\\t\\tof Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) to see if he would\\n\\t\\t\\tpermit me (to reply). Zaynab continued until I realized that\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Messenger (peace be upon him) would not disapprove if I\\n\\t\\t\\tretorted. Then I exchanged hot words until I made her quiet. \\n\\t\\t\\tThereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) smiled and said:\\n\\t\\t\\tShe is the daughter of AbuBakr.

My brother Unays, our mother and I stayed\\n\\t\\t\\twith our maternal uncle who treated us well.  The men of his\\n\\t\\t\\ttribe felt jealous and they said: When you are away from your\\n\\t\\t\\thouse, Unays commits adultery with your wife. Our maternal uncle\\n\\t\\t\\tcame and he accused us of the sin about which he had been\\n\\t\\t\\tinformed.  I said: You have undone the good you did to us. We\\n\\t\\t\\tcannot stay with you after this. We came to our camels and loaded\\n\\t\\t\\t(our) luggage. Our maternal uncle began to weep, covering himself\\n\\t\\t\\twith (a piece of) cloth. We proceeded until we encamped by the\\n\\t\\t\\tside of Mecca. Unays cast lot on the camels (we had) and an equal\\n\\t\\t\\tnumber (above that). They both went to a Kahin and he made Unays\\n\\t\\t\\twin and Unays came with our camels and an equal number along with\\n\\t\\t\\tthem. He (AbuDharr) said: My nephew, I used to observe prayer\\n\\t\\t\\tthree years before my meeting with Allah's Messenger (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\tupon him).  I said: To whom did you say your prayer?  He said: To\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah.\\tI said: In which direction did you turn your face (for\\n\\t\\t\\tobserving prayer)?  He said: I used to turn my face as Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\tdirected me to turn my face. I used to observe the night prayer\\n\\t\\t\\ttowards the end of night and I fell down in prostration like a\\n\\t\\t\\tmantle until the sun rose over me. Unays said: I have work in\\n\\t\\t\\tMecca, so you had better stay here. Unays continued until he came\\n\\t\\t\\tto Mecca and he came back to me late.  I said: What did you do? \\n\\t\\t\\tHe said: I met a person in Mecca who is of your religion and he\\n\\t\\t\\tclaims that verily it is Allah Who has sent him.  I said: What do\\n\\t\\t\\tthe people say about him? He said: They say that he is a poet or\\n\\t\\t\\ta Kahin or magician. Unays who was himself one of the poets said:\\n\\t\\t\\tI have heard the words of a Kahin but his words in no way\\n\\t\\t\\tresemble his (words). I also compared his words with the verses\\n\\t\\t\\tof poets but such words cannot be uttered by any poet. By Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\the is truthful and they are liars.  Then I said: You stay here\\n\\t\\t\\twhile I go to see him. He said: I came to Mecca and I selected an\\n\\t\\t\\tinsignificant person from amongst them and said to him: Where is\\n\\t\\t\\the whom you call a Sabi?  He pointed towards me, saying: He is\\n\\t\\t\\tSabi. Thereupon the people of the valley attacked me with sods\\n\\t\\t\\tand bows until I fell down unconscious. I stood up after\\n\\t\\t\\tregaining consciousness and I found that I resembled a red idol.\\n\\t\\t\\tI came to Zamzam, washed blood from myself and drank water from\\n\\t\\t\\tit. Listen, O son of my brother, I stayed there for thirty nights\\n\\t\\t\\tor days and there was no food for me but the water of Zamzam. And\\n\\t\\t\\tI became so emaciated that there appeared wrinkles upon my\\n\\t\\t\\tstomach, yet I did not feel any hunger in my stomach. It was\\n\\t\\t\\tduring this time that the people of Mecca slept during the\\n\\t\\t\\tmoonlit night and there was none to circumambulate the House\\n\\t\\t\\texcept two women who had been invoking the name of Isafa and\\n\\t\\t\\tNa'ilah (the two idols). They came to me while on their circuit\\n\\t\\t\\tand I said: Marry one to the other, but they did not dissuade\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom their invocation. They came to me and I said to them: Insert\\n\\t\\t\\twood (in the idols' private parts). (I said this to them in such\\n\\t\\t\\tplain words) as I could not express it in metaphorical terms.\\n\\t\\t\\tThese women went away crying and saying: Had there been one\\n\\t\\t\\tamongst our people (he would have taught a lesson to you for the\\n\\t\\t\\tobscene words used for our idols before us). These women met\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and AbuBakr who had also\\n\\t\\t\\tbeen coming down the hill.  He asked them: What has happened to\\n\\t\\t\\tyou?  They said: It is Sabi, who has hidden himself between the\\n\\t\\t\\tKa'bah and its curtain.  He said: What did he say to you?  They\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: He uttered such words before us as we cannot express.\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Messenger (peace be upon him) came and he kissed the\\n\\t\\t\\tBlack Stone, circumambulated the House along with his companion\\n\\t\\t\\tand then observed prayer. AbuDharr said: When he had finished his\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer, I was the first to greet him with the salutation of peace\\n\\t\\t\\tand uttered (the words) in this way Allah's Messenger, may there\\n\\t\\t\\tbe peace upon you. Thereupon he said: May it be upon you too, and\\n\\t\\t\\tthe mercy of Allah. He then said: Who are you?\\tI said: From the\\n\\t\\t\\ttribe of Ghifar.  He praised his hand and placed his finger on\\n\\t\\t\\this forehead and I said to myself: Perhaps he does not like my\\n\\t\\t\\tbelonging to the tribe of Ghifar. I attempted to catch hold of\\n\\t\\t\\this hand but his friend, who knew about him more than I,\\n\\t\\t\\tdissuaded me from doing so. He then lifted his head and said: For\\n\\t\\t\\thow long have you been here?  I said: I have been here for the\\n\\t\\t\\tlast thirty nights or days.  He said: Who has been feeding you? \\n\\t\\t\\tI said: There has been no food for me but the water of Zamzam. I\\n\\t\\t\\thave grown so emaciated that there are wrinkles upon my stomach\\n\\t\\t\\tand I do not feel any hunger. He said: It is blessed (water) and\\n\\t\\t\\tit also serves as food. Thereupon AbuBakr said: Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tMessenger, let me serve as a host to him for tonight. Then\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Messenger (peace be upon him) proceeded forth, so did\\n\\t\\t\\tAbuBakr, and I went with them. AbuBakr opened the door and then\\n\\t\\t\\the brought for us the raisins of Ta'if and that was the first\\n\\t\\t\\tfood which I ate there. Then I stayed as long as I had to stay. I\\n\\t\\t\\tthen came to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and he said: I\\n\\t\\t\\thave been shown the land abounding in trees and I think it must\\n\\t\\t\\tbe that of Yathrib (that is the old name of Medina). You are a\\n\\t\\t\\tpreacher to your people on my behalf. I hope Allah will benefit\\n\\t\\t\\tthem through you and He will reward you.  I came to Unays and he\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: What have you done?  I said: What I have done is to embrace\\n\\t\\t\\tIslam and testify (to the prophethood of Allah's Messenger). He\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace\\n\\t\\t\\tIslam and testify (to the prophethood of Muhammad). Then both of\\n\\t\\t\\tus came to our mother and she said: I have no aversion for your\\n\\t\\t\\treligion and I also embrace Islam and testify to the prophethood\\n\\t\\t\\tof Muhammad. We then loaded our camels and came to our tribe\\n\\t\\t\\tGhifar and half of the tribe embraced Islam and their chief was\\n\\t\\t\\tAyma' ibn Rahadah Ghifari and he was their leader and half of the\\n\\t\\t\\ttribe said: We will embrace Islam when Allah's Messenger (peace\\n\\t\\t\\tbe upon him) would come to Medina, and when Allah's Messenger\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him) came to Medina the remaining half also\\n\\t\\t\\tembraced Islam. Then the tribe Aslam came to the Holy Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him) and said: Allah's Messenger, we also embrace\\n\\t\\t\\tIslam like our brothers who have embraced Islam. And they also\\n\\t\\t\\tembraced Islam. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him)\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: Allah granted pardon to the tribe of Ghifar and Allah saved\\n\\t\\t\\t(from destruction) the tribe of Aslam.\\n\\t\\t</p>"

So he said: I harbour fear in regard to you in\\n\\t\\t\\tso many other things besides the Dajjal. If he comes forth while\\n\\t\\t\\tI am among you, I shall contend with him on your behalf, but if\\n\\t\\t\\the comes forth while I am not among you, a man must contend on\\n\\t\\t\\this own behalf and Allah will take care of every Muslim on my\\n\\t\\t\\tbehalf (and safeguard him against his evil). He (the Dajjal) will\\n\\t\\t\\tbe a young man with twisted, cropped hair, and a blind eye. I\\n\\t\\t\\tcompare him with AbdulUzza ibn Qatan. He who among you will\\n\\t\\t\\tsurvive to see him should recite over him the opening verses of\\n\\t\\t\\tSurah al-Kahf (xviii). He will appear on the way between Syria\\n\\t\\t\\tand Iraq and will spread mischief right and left. O servant of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah! Adhere (to the path of Truth). We said: Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him), how long will he stay on Earth?  He said:\\n\\t\\t\\tFor forty days, one day like a year, one day like a month, one\\n\\t\\t\\tday like a week, and the rest of the days will be like your days.\\n\\t\\t\\t We said: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) will one day's\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer suffice for the prayers of the day equal to one year?\\n\\t\\t\\tThereupon he said: No, but you must make an estimate of the time\\n\\t\\t\\t(and then observe prayer). We said: Allah's apostle (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\tupon him) how quickly will he walk upon the earth?  Thereupon he\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: Like cloud driven by the wind. He will come to the people\\n\\t\\t\\tand invite them (to a wrong religion); they will affirm their\\n\\t\\t\\tfaith in him and respond to him. He will then give a command to\\n\\t\\t\\tthe sky: there will be rainfall upon the Earth and it will grow\\n\\t\\t\\tcrops. Then in the evening, their pasturing animals will come to\\n\\t\\t\\tthem with their humps very high, their udders full of milk and\\n\\t\\t\\ttheir flanks distended. He will then come to another people and\\n\\t\\t\\tinvite them. But they will reject him so he will go away from\\n\\t\\t\\tthem; they will have a drought and nothing will be left with them\\n\\t\\t\\tin the form of wealth. He will then walk through the desert and\\n\\t\\t\\tsay to it: Bring forth your treasures. The treasures will come\\n\\t\\t\\tout and gather before him like a swarm of bees. He will then call\\n\\t\\t\\tsomeone in the flush of youth, strike him with the sword, cut him\\n\\t\\t\\tinto two pieces and (make these pieces lie at the distance which\\n\\t\\t\\tis generally between the archer and his target. He will then call\\n\\t\\t\\t(that young man) and he will come forward laughing with his face\\n\\t\\t\\tgleaming (with happiness). It will at this very time that Allah\\n\\t\\t\\twill send Christ, son of Mary. He will descend at the white\\n\\t\\t\\tminaret on the eastern side of Damascus, wearing two garments\\n\\t\\t\\tlightly dyed with saffron and placing his hands on the wings of\\n\\t\\t\\ttwo Angels. When he lowers his head, there will fall beads of\\n\\t\\t\\tperspiration from his head, and when he raises it up, beads like\\n\\t\\t\\tpearls will scatter from it. Every non-believer who smells the\\n\\t\\t\\todour of his body will die and his breath will reach as far as he\\n\\t\\t\\tis able to see. He will then search for him (Dajjal) until he\\n\\t\\t\\tcatches hold of him at the gate of Ludd and kills him. Then a\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople whom Allah had protected will come to Jesus, son of Mary,\\n\\t\\t\\tand he will wipe their faces and inform them of their ranks in\\n\\t\\t\\tParadise.  It will be under such conditions that Allah will\\n\\t\\t\\treveal to Jesus these words: I have brought forth from among My\\n\\t\\t\\tservants such people against whom none will be able to fight; you\\n\\t\\t\\ttake these people safely to Tur, and then Allah will send Gog and\\n\\t\\t\\tMagog and they will swarm down from every slope. The first of\\n\\t\\t\\tthem will pass the lake of Tiberias and drink out of it.  And\\n\\t\\t\\twhen the last of them passes, he will say: There was once water\\n\\t\\t\\tthere. Jesus and his companions will then be besieged here (at\\n\\t\\t\\tTur, and they will be so hard pressed) that the head of the ox\\n\\t\\t\\twill be dearer to them than one hundred dinars. Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him), Jesus, and his companions will supplicate\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah, Who will send to them insects (which will attack their\\n\\t\\t\\tnecks) and in the morning they would perish as one single person.\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle (peace be upon him), Jesus, and his companions,\\n\\t\\t\\tthen come down to Earth and they will not find on Earth as much\\n\\t\\t\\tspace as a single span that is not filled with putrefaction and\\n\\t\\t\\tstench. Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him), Jesus, and his\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanions will then beseech Allah who will send birds whose\\n\\t\\t\\tnecks would be like those of Bactrian camels and they will carry\\n\\t\\t\\tthem away and throw them where Allah wills. Then Allah will send\\n\\t\\t\\train which no house of mud-bricks or (tent of) camel-hair will\\n\\t\\t\\tkeep out and it will wash the Earth until it resembles a mirror.\\n\\t\\t\\tThen the Earth will be told to bring forth its fruit and restore\\n\\t\\t\\tits blessing and, as a result thereof, there will grow (such a\\n\\t\\t\\tbig) pomegranate that a group of people will be able to eat it\\n\\t\\t\\tand seek shelter under its skin, a dairy cow will give so much\\n\\t\\t\\tmilk that a whole party will be able to drink it. The milking\\n\\t\\t\\tcamel will give such (a large quantity of) milk that the whole\\n\\t\\t\\ttribe will be able to drink from it, and the milking-sheep will\\n\\t\\t\\tgive so much milk that the whole family will be able to drink\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom it.

When I became a widow,\\n\\t\\t\\tAbdurRahman ibn Awf, one of the group of the companions of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's Apostle. sent me a proposal of marriage. Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him) also sent me such a message for his freed\\n\\t\\t\\tslave, Usamah ibn Zayd.

She spent generously for the cause of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah and entertained guests very hospitably.  I said: Well, I\\n\\t\\t\\tshall do as you wish.

When Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him) had finished his prayer, he sat on the\\n\\t\\t\\tpulpit, smiling, and said: Every worshipper should remain sitting\\n\\t\\t\\tin his place. He then said: Do you know why I have asked you to\\n\\t\\t\\tassemble?  They said: Allah and His apostle know best. He said:\\n\\t\\t\\tBy Allah, I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a\\n\\t\\t\\twarning. I have detained you here because Tamim Dari, a Christian\\n\\t\\t\\twho came and accepted Islam, told me something which agrees with\\n\\t\\t\\twhat I was telling you about the Dajjal. He narrated to me that\\n\\t\\t\\the had sailed in a ship with thirty men of Banu Lakhm and Banu\\n\\t\\t\\tJudham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month.\\n\\t\\t\\tThen these (waves) took them (near) the land within the ocean\\n\\t\\t\\t(island) at the time of sunset. They sat in a small rowing-boat\\n\\t\\t\\tand landed on that island. There was a beast with long thick hair\\n\\t\\t\\t(and because of this) they could not distinguish his face from\\n\\t\\t\\this back.  They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: I am al-Jassasah.  They said: What is al-Jassasah? It said:\\n\\t\\t\\tO people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very much\\n\\t\\t\\teager to know about you.  He (the narrator) said: When it named a\\n\\t\\t\\tperson for us we were afraid of it lest it should be a Devil.\\n\\t\\t\\tThen we hurried on till we came to that monastery and found a\\n\\t\\t\\twell-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and iron\\n\\t\\t\\tshackles gripping his legs by the ankles.  We said: Woe to you,\\n\\t\\t\\twho are you? He said: You soon come to know about me, but tell me\\n\\t\\t\\twho you are.  We said: We are people from Arabia and we embarked\\n\\t\\t\\tupon a boat but the waves had been driving us for one month and\\n\\t\\t\\tthey brought us near this island. We took to the rowing-boats and\\n\\t\\t\\tlanded on this island. Here a beast with profusely thick hair met\\n\\t\\t\\tus and because of the thickness of his hair his face could not be\\n\\t\\t\\tdistinguished from his back. We said: Woe be to thee, who are\\n\\t\\t\\tyou?  It said: I am al- Jassasah.  We said: What is al-Jassasah? \\n\\t\\t\\tIt said: You go to this very person in the monastery for he is\\n\\t\\t\\teagerly waiting for you to know about you. So we came to you in\\n\\t\\t\\thot haste fearing that that might be the Devil.  He (that chained\\n\\t\\t\\tperson) said: Tell me about the date-palm trees of Baysan.  We\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: In which respect do you seek information about it?  He\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: I ask you whether these trees bear fruit or not.\\tWe said:\\n\\t\\t\\tYes.  Thereupon he said: I think these will not bear fruit. He\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: Inform me about the lake of Tabariyyah?  We said: What do\\n\\t\\t\\tyou want to know about it?  He said: Is there water in it?  They\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: There is an abundance of water in it. Thereupon he said: I\\n\\t\\t\\tthink it will soon dry up. He again said: Inform me about the\\n\\t\\t\\tspring of Zughar.  They said: What do you want to know about it? \\n\\t\\t\\tHe (the chained person) said: Is there water in it and does it\\n\\t\\t\\tirrigate (the land)?  We said to him: Yes, there is an abundance\\n\\t\\t\\tof water in it and the inhabitants (of Medina) irrigate (land)\\n\\t\\t\\twith its help.\\tHe said: Inform me about the unlettered Prophet;\\n\\t\\t\\twhat has he done?  We said: He has left Mecca and has settled in\\n\\t\\t\\tYathrib (Medina).  He said: Do the Arabs fight against him?  We\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: Yes.  He said: How does he deal with him?  We informed him\\n\\t\\t\\tthat he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had\\n\\t\\t\\tsubmitted themselves before him. Thereupon he said to us: Had it\\n\\t\\t\\tactually happened?  We said: Yes. Thereupon he said: If it is so\\n\\t\\t\\tthat is better for them that they show obedience to him. I am\\n\\t\\t\\tgoing to tell you about myself. I am the Dajjal and will be soon\\n\\t\\t\\tpermitted to leave. So I shall leave and travel in the land, and\\n\\t\\t\\tshall not spare any town where I shall not stay for forty nights\\n\\t\\t\\texcept Mecca and Medina: these two (places) are prohibited\\n\\t\\t\\t(areas) for me and I shall not attempt to enter either of them.\\n\\t\\t\\tAn angel with a sword in his hand will confront me and bar my way\\n\\t\\t\\tand there will be angels to guard every road leading to it. Then\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah's apostle (peace be upon him) striking the pulpit with the\\n\\t\\t\\thelp of the end of his staff said: This implies Tayba meaning\\n\\t\\t\\tMedina. Have I not told you an account (of the Dajjal) like this?\\n\\t\\t\\tThe people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was\\n\\t\\t\\tliked by me for it corroborates the account which I gave to you\\n\\t\\t\\tin regard to him (Dajjal) at Medina and Mecca. Behold he (Dajjal)\\n\\t\\t\\tis in the Syrian sea (Mediterranean) or the Yemen sea (Arabian\\n\\t\\t\\tsea). Nay, on the contrary, he is in the east, he is in the east,\\n\\t\\t\\the is in the east, and he pointed with his hand towards the east.\\n\\t\\t\\tI (Fatimah bint Qays) said: I preserved it in my mind (this\\n\\t\\t\\tnarration from Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him).\\n\\t\\t</p>"

As he (the magician)\\n\\t\\t\\tgrew old, he said to the king: I have grown old, send some young\\n\\t\\t\\tboy to me so that I may teach him magic. He (the king) sent to\\n\\t\\t\\thim a young man so that he might train him (in magic). On his way\\n\\t\\t\\t(to the magician) he (the young man) found a monk sitting there.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe (the young man) listened to his (the monk's) talk and was\\n\\t\\t\\timpressed by it. It became his habit that on his way to the\\n\\t\\t\\tmagician he met the monk set there so he was late in coming to\\n\\t\\t\\tthe magician. He (the magician) beat him because of the delay. He\\n\\t\\t\\tmade a complaint about it to the monk and he said to him: When\\n\\t\\t\\tyou feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my family\\n\\t\\t\\tdetained me. And when you feel afraid of your family you should\\n\\t\\t\\tsay: The magician detained me. It so happened that there came a\\n\\t\\t\\thuge beast (of prey) and it blocked the way of the people. He\\n\\t\\t\\t(the young boy) said: I shall find out today whether the magician\\n\\t\\t\\tor the monk is superior. He picked up a stone and said: O Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\tif the affairs of the monk are dearer to Thee than the affairs of\\n\\t\\t\\tthe magician, bring death to this animal so that the people will\\n\\t\\t\\tbe able to move about freely. He threw that stone towards it and\\n\\t\\t\\tkilled it and the people began to move about (on the path\\n\\t\\t\\tfreely). He (the young man) then came to that monk and informed\\n\\t\\t\\thim. The monk said: My son, today you are superior to me. Your\\n\\t\\t\\taffairs have reached a stage where I find that you will be soon\\n\\t\\t\\tput to the test, and in case you are put to don't reveal my\\n\\t\\t\\tidentity. That young man began to treat the blind and those\\n\\t\\t\\tsuffering from leprosy and he in fact began to cure people of\\n\\t\\t\\t(all kinds) of illness. When a companion of the king, who had\\n\\t\\t\\tbecome blind heard, about him, he came to him with numerous gifts\\n\\t\\t\\tand said: If you cure me, all these things collected together\\n\\t\\t\\there will be yours. He said: I myself do not cure anyone; it is\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah Who cures. If you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also\\n\\t\\t\\tsupplicate Allah to cure you. He affirmed his faith in Allah and\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah cured him. He came to the king and sat by his side as he\\n\\t\\t\\tused to sit before.  The king said to him: Who restored your\\n\\t\\t\\teyesight?  He said: My Lord.  Thereupon he said: It means that\\n\\t\\t\\tyour Lord is One besides me.  He said: My Lord and your Lord is\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah; so he (the king) took hold of him and tormented him until\\n\\t\\t\\the revealed the identity of boy. The young man was thus summoned\\n\\t\\t\\tand the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that\\n\\t\\t\\tyou have become so proficient in your magic that you cure the\\n\\t\\t\\tblind and those suffering from leprosy and you do such and such\\n\\t\\t\\tthings. Thereupon he said: I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Who\\n\\t\\t\\tcures. He (the king) took hold of him and began to torment him.\\n\\t\\t\\tSo he revealed the identity of the monk.  The monk was thus\\n\\t\\t\\tsummoned and it was said to him: You should turn back from your\\n\\t\\t\\treligion. He, however, refused to do so. He (ordered) a saw to be\\n\\t\\t\\tbrought (and when it was done) he (the king) placed it in the\\n\\t\\t\\tmiddle of his head and backed it until it fell apart. Then the\\n\\t\\t\\tcourtier of the king was brought and it was said to him: Turn\\n\\t\\t\\tback from your religion but he refused to do so. Therefore the\\n\\t\\t\\tsaw was placed in the middle of his head which was backed until\\n\\t\\t\\tit fell apart.\\tThen young boy was brought and it was said to\\n\\t\\t\\thim: Turn back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was\\n\\t\\t\\thanded over to a group of his courtier. He said to them: Take him\\n\\t\\t\\tto such and such mountain; make him climb that mountain and when\\n\\t\\t\\tyou reach its top (ask him to renounce his faith) but if he\\n\\t\\t\\trefuses to do so, then throw him (down the mountain). So they\\n\\t\\t\\ttook him and made him climb the mountain and he said: O Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\tsave me from them (in any way) Thou likest. The mountain began to\\n\\t\\t\\tquake and they all fell down young man came walking back to the\\n\\t\\t\\tking.  The king said to him: What has happened to your\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanions?  He said: Allah has saved me from them.  He again\\n\\t\\t\\thanded him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry\\n\\t\\t\\thim away in a small boat and when you reach the middle of the\\n\\t\\t\\tocean (ask him to renounce) his religion, but if he does not\\n\\t\\t\\trenounce his religion throw him (into the water). So they took\\n\\t\\t\\thim and he said: O Allah, save me from them and what they want to\\n\\t\\t\\tdo. It was not long before the boat overturned and they were\\n\\t\\t\\tdrowned but he came walking back to the king. The king said to\\n\\t\\t\\thim: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has\\n\\t\\t\\tsaved me from them. He also said to the king: You cannot kill me\\n\\t\\t\\tuntil you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is that? He\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: You should gather people on a plain and hang me by the\\n\\t\\t\\ttrunk (of a tree). Then take an arrow from the quiver and say: In\\n\\t\\t\\tthe name of Allah, the Lord of the world; then shoot an arrow and\\n\\t\\t\\tif you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he (the\\n\\t\\t\\tking) called the people to an open plain and tied him (the boy)\\n\\t\\t\\tto the trunk of a tree. Then he took an arrow from his quiver\\n\\t\\t\\tplaced the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Lord of the young boy; he then shot an arrow and it hit his\\n\\t\\t\\ttemple. He (the boy) placed his hands upon the temple where the\\n\\t\\t\\tarrow had hit him and he. The people said: We affirm our faith in\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of\\n\\t\\t\\tthis young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young\\n\\t\\t\\tman.  The courtiers came to the king and it was said to him: Do\\n\\t\\t\\tyou see that their faith is in the Lord?  He (the king) commanded\\n\\t\\t\\tditches to be dug at important points in the path. When these\\n\\t\\t\\tditches were dug, and the fire was lit in them it was said (to\\n\\t\\t\\tthe people): He who not turn back from his (boy's) religion will\\n\\t\\t\\tbe thrown in the fire or they will be told to jump in it. (The\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople courted death but did not renounce religion) till a woman\\n\\t\\t\\tcame with her child and she felt hesitant about jumping into the\\n\\t\\t\\tfire the child said to her: O mother, endure (this ordeal) for it\\n\\t\\t\\tis the Truth.\\n\\t\\t</p>"

There was a young man with\\n\\t\\t\\thim, who carried the record of letter with him, and he wore a\\n\\t\\t\\tmantle prepared by the tribe of Ma'afiri. His servant too were a\\n\\t\\t\\tMa'afiri mantle. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs\\n\\t\\t\\tof anger or agony on your face.  He said: Yes, a certain person,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami was in debt to me, I\\n\\t\\t\\twent to his family, greeted them and said: Where is he?  They\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: He is not here. Then there came out to me his son who was\\n\\t\\t\\ton the threshold of youth.  I said to him: Where is your father? \\n\\t\\t\\tHe said: No sooner did he hear your arrival than he hid himself\\n\\t\\t\\tbehind my mother's bed.  I said to him: come out to me, for I\\n\\t\\t\\tknow where you are. He came out.  I said to him: What prompted\\n\\t\\t\\tyou to hide yourself from me? He said: By Allah, whatever I say\\n\\t\\t\\tto you will not be a lie. By Allah, I fear lest I should tell a\\n\\t\\t\\tlie to you and in the case of making promise you I should break\\n\\t\\t\\tit, as you are the companion of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money.  I said:\\n\\t\\t\\tDo you adjure by Allah?  He said: I adjure by Allah.  I said: Do\\n\\t\\t\\tyou adjure by Allah?  He said: I adjure by Allah.  I said: Do you\\n\\t\\t\\tadjure by Allah?  He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his\\n\\t\\t\\tpromissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay\\n\\t\\t\\tme back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. Saw\\n\\t\\t\\twith my own eyes he (AbulYasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes,\\n\\t\\t\\tI heard with my own ears and it was lodged in my heart, he\\n\\t\\t\\tpointed towards his heart, that Allah's Apostle (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up\\n\\t\\t\\t(in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will\\n\\t\\t\\tprovide him with His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you take\\n\\t\\t\\tthe cloak of your servant and you give him your two garments, or\\n\\t\\t\\ttake his two garments of Ma'afir and give him your cloak, then\\n\\t\\t\\tthere will be one dress for you and one for him.

Jabir said: I set out\\n\\t\\t\\tand took hold of a stone, broke it and sharpened it, then I came\\n\\t\\t\\tto those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then\\n\\t\\t\\tbrought them until I stood at the place where Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the\\n\\t\\t\\tright and a twig on the left.  Then I met him and said: Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle (peace be upon him) I have done that, but (kindly)\\n\\t\\t\\texplain to me the reason for it.  Thereupon he said: I passed by\\n\\t\\t\\ttwo graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I\\n\\t\\t\\tliked to make intercession for them so that they might be\\n\\t\\t\\trelieved of the torment as long as these twigs remain fresh. \\n\\t\\t\\tJabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allah's\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle (peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call the people to\\n\\t\\t\\tperform wudu.  I cried: Come and perform wudu , come and perform\\n\\t\\t\\twudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allah's Apostle (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\tupon him) there is not even a drop of water in the army camp.\\n\\t\\t\\tThere was a person who used to cool the water for Allah's Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\tin the old water-skin which was hung on a branch twig. He asked\\n\\t\\t\\tme to go to a certain Ansari and ask him to see if there were.\\n\\t\\t\\tany water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but\\n\\t\\t\\tdid not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin\\n\\t\\t\\tand if I were to draw that, the water-skin's dried part would\\n\\t\\t\\tsuck it up.  I came to Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) and\\n\\t\\t\\tsaid: Allah's Apostle, I have not found anything in it but a drop\\n\\t\\t\\tof water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw\\n\\t\\t\\tthat, it would be absorbed.  He said: Go and bring that to me. I\\n\\t\\t\\tbrought it to him. He took hold of it, began to utter something\\n\\t\\t\\twhich I could not understand, then pressed it with his hand gave\\n\\t\\t\\tit to me and said: Jabir, announce the tub to be brought. So I\\n\\t\\t\\tannounced the tub of the army (to be brought). It was brought\\n\\t\\t\\taccordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). \\n\\t\\t\\tThereupon Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) placed his hands in\\n\\t\\t\\tthe tub like this, with his fingers outstretched, then he placed\\n\\t\\t\\this fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it\\n\\t\\t\\t(the water-skin) and pour water over me by reciting Bismillah. \\n\\t\\t\\tSo I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water out\\n\\t\\t\\tbetween the fingers of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him).  Then\\n\\t\\t\\tthat tub gushed forth until it was filled and the Apostle (peace\\n\\t\\t\\tbe upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He\\n\\t\\t\\twho needs water should take it.  Jabir said: The people came and\\n\\t\\t\\ttook water until they were all satisfied.  I said: Is there\\n\\t\\t\\tanyone left who wants to take it? Allah's Apostle (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim) then lifted his hand from that tub and it was still full.\\n\\t\\t\\tThen the people made a complaint to Allah's Apostle (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\tupon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you with\\n\\t\\t\\tfood! We came to the shore of the ocean; There was a heavy swell\\n\\t\\t\\tand it cast ashore a big animal we lit, a fire, cooked it and\\n\\t\\t\\thelped ourselves until we had eaten to our heart's content. \\n\\t\\t\\tJabir said: About five people and myself entered its socket and\\n\\t\\t\\tnobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of\\n\\t\\t\\tone of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch. Then we\\n\\t\\t\\tcalled the tallest person in the army and the biggest camel of\\n\\t\\t\\tthe army, with the the big saddle on its back, and it could\\n\\t\\t\\teasily pass through it without the rider needing to bend down.\\n\\t\\t</p>"
