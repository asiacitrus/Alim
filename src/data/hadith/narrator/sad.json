As regards\\n\\t\\t\\tfasting, he said: The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) used\\n\\t\\t\\tto fast for three days every month, and would fast on the tenth\\n\\t\\t\\tof Muharram. Then Allah, the Exalted, revealed the verse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\".......Fasting was prescribed for those before you, that ye may\\n\\t\\t\\tward off (evil)......and for those who can afford it there is a\\n\\t\\t\\transom: the feeding of a man in need (ii.183-84).

As regards agricultural\\n\\t\\t\\tproduce, a tenth is payable on that which is watered by rivers or\\n\\t\\t\\train, and a twentieth on that which is watered by draught\\n\\t\\t\\tcamels.\"  The version of Asim and al-Harith says: \"Sadaqah\\n\\t\\t\\t(zakat) is payable every year.\" Zuhayr said: I think he said\\n\\t\\t\\t\"Once a year\".\\tThe version of Asim has the words: \"If a\\n\\t\\t\\tshe-camel in her second year is not available among the camels,\\n\\t\\t\\tnor is there a bull-camel in its third year, ten dirhams or two\\n\\t\\t\\tgoats are to be given.\"\\n\\t\\t</p>"

He then\\n\\t\\t\\tturned to the women and said (to them): Is there any woman among\\n\\t\\t\\tyou who narrates it? They kept silence. Then a girl fell on one\\n\\t\\t\\tof her knees. The narrator, Mu'ammil, said in his version: a\\n\\t\\t\\tbuxom girl.

He said: Do you know what the\\n\\t\\t\\tsimilitude is?

You should fight our companion\\n\\t\\t\\tor we shall deal with you in a certain way. And nothing will come\\n\\t\\t\\tbetween us and the anklets of your women. When their letter\\n\\t\\t\\treached the Prophet (peace be upon him), they gathered Banu\\n\\t\\t\\tan-Nadir to violate the treaty.  They sent a message to the\\n\\t\\t\\tProphet (peace be upon him): Come out to us with thirty men from\\n\\t\\t\\tyour companions, and thirty rabbis will come out from us till we\\n\\t\\t\\tmeet at a central place where they will hear you. If they testify\\n\\t\\t\\tto you and believe in you, we shall believe in you. The narrator\\n\\t\\t\\tthen narrated the whole story.\\tWhen the next day came, the\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle of Allah (peace be upon him) went out in the morning with\\n\\t\\t\\tan army, and surrounded them.  He told them: I swear by Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou will have no peace from me until you conclude a treaty with\\n\\t\\t\\tme. But they refused to conclude a treaty with him. He therefore\\n\\t\\t\\tfought them the same day.  Next he attacked Banu Quraysh with an\\n\\t\\t\\tarmy in the morning, and left Banu an-Nadir. He asked them to\\n\\t\\t\\tsign a treaty and they signed it.  He turned away from them and\\n\\t\\t\\tattacked Banu an-Nadir with an army. He fought with them until\\n\\t\\t\\tthey agreed to expulsion. Banu an-Nadir were deported, and they\\n\\t\\t\\ttook with them whatever their camels could carry, that is, their\\n\\t\\t\\tproperty, the doors of their houses, and their wood. Palm-trees\\n\\t\\t\\twere exclusively reserved for the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim). Allah bestowed them upon him and gave them him as a special\\n\\t\\t\\tportion.  He (Allah), the Exalted, said: What Allah has bestowed\\n\\t\\t\\ton His Apostle (and taken away) from them, for this ye made no\\n\\t\\t\\texpedition with either camel corps or cavalry.\" He said: \"Without\\n\\t\\t\\tfighting.\" So the Prophet (peace be upon him) gave most of it to\\n\\t\\t\\tthe emigrants and divided it among them; and he divided some of\\n\\t\\t\\tit between two men from the helpers, who were needy, and he did\\n\\t\\t\\tnot divide it among any of the helpers except those two. The rest\\n\\t\\t\\tof it survived as the sadaqah of the Apostle of Allah (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\tupon him) which is in the hands of the descendants of Fatimah\\n\\t\\t\\t(Allah be pleased with her).\\n\\t\\t</p>"

When he saw me, he said: O Abyssinian.  I said: I\\n\\t\\t\\tam at your service. He met me with unpleasant looks and said\\n\\t\\t\\tharsh words to me.  He asked me: Do you know how many days remain\\n\\t\\t\\tin the completion of this month?  I replied: The time is near. \\n\\t\\t\\tHe said: Only four days remain in the completion of this month. I\\n\\t\\t\\tshall then take that which is due from you (i.e. loan), and then\\n\\t\\t\\tshall return you to tend the sheep as you did before. I began to\\n\\t\\t\\tthink in my mind what people think in their minds (on such\\n\\t\\t\\toccasions). When I offered the night prayer, the Apostle of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him) returned to his family. I sought permission\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom him and he gave me permission.  I said: Apostle of Allah,\\n\\t\\t\\tmay my parents be sacrificed for you, the polytheist from whom I\\n\\t\\t\\tused to borrow money said to me such-and-such. Neither you nor I\\n\\t\\t\\thave anything to pay him for me, and he will disgrace me. So give\\n\\t\\t\\tme permission to run away to some of those tribes who have\\n\\t\\t\\trecently embraced Islam until Allah gives His Apostle (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\tupon him) something with which he can pay (the debt) for me. So I\\n\\t\\t\\tcame out and reached my house. I placed my sword, waterskin (or\\n\\t\\t\\tsheath), shoes and shield near my head. When dawn broke, I\\n\\t\\t\\tintended to be on my way.  All of a sudden I saw a man running\\n\\t\\t\\ttowards me and calling: Bilal, return to the Apostle of Allah\\n\\t\\t\\t(peace be upon him). So I went till I reached him. I found four\\n\\t\\t\\tmounts kneeling on the ground with loads on them. I sought\\n\\t\\t\\tpermission.  The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) said to me:\\n\\t\\t\\tBe glad, Allah has made arrangements for the payment (of your\\n\\t\\t\\tdebt). He then asked: Have you not seen the four mounts kneeling\\n\\t\\t\\ton the ground?\\tI replied: Yes.  He said: You may have these\\n\\t\\t\\tmounts and what they have on them. There are clothes and food on\\n\\t\\t\\tthem, presented to me by the ruler of Fadak. Take them away and\\n\\t\\t\\tpay off your debt. I did so.  He then mentioned the rest of the\\n\\t\\t\\ttradition. I then went to the mosque and found that the Apostle\\n\\t\\t\\tof Allah (peace be upon him) was sitting there. I greeted him. \\n\\t\\t\\tHe asked: What benefit did you have from your property?  I\\n\\t\\t\\treplied: Allah Most High paid everything which was due from the\\n\\t\\t\\tApostle of Allah (peace be upon him). Nothing remains now.  He\\n\\t\\t\\tasked: Did anything remain (from that property)?  I said: Yes. \\n\\t\\t\\tHe said: Look, if you can give me some comfort from it, for I\\n\\t\\t\\tshall not visit any member of my family until you give me some\\n\\t\\t\\tcomfort from it. When the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him)\\n\\t\\t\\toffered the night prayer, he called me and said: What is the\\n\\t\\t\\tposition of that which you had with you (i.e. property)?  I said:\\n\\t\\t\\tI still have it, no one came to me. The Apostle of Allah (peace\\n\\t\\t\\tbe upon him) passed the night in the mosque.  He then narrated\\n\\t\\t\\tthe rest of the tradition. Next day when he offered the night\\n\\t\\t\\tprayer, he called me and asked: What is the position of that\\n\\t\\t\\twhich you had (i.e. the rest of the property)?\\tI replied: Allah\\n\\t\\t\\thas given you comfort from it, Apostle of Allah.  He said: Allah\\n\\t\\t\\tis Most Great, and praised Allah, fearing lest he should die\\n\\t\\t\\twhile it was with him. I then followed him until he came to his\\n\\t\\t\\twives and greeted each one of them and finally he came to his\\n\\t\\t\\tplace where he had to pass the night. This is all for which you\\n\\t\\t\\tasked me.\\n\\t\\t</p>"

Al-Ala' ibn Ziyad asked: AbuHamzah, did the Apostle of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah (peace be upon him) say the funeral prayer over the dead as\\n\\t\\t\\tyou have done, uttering four takbirs (Allah is Most Great) over\\n\\t\\t\\ther, and standing opposite the head of a man and the hips of a\\n\\t\\t\\twoman?\\tHe replied: Yes.  He asked: AbuHamzah, did you fight with\\n\\t\\t\\tthe Apostle of Allah?  He replied: Yes. I fought with him in the\\n\\t\\t\\tbattle of Hunayn. The polytheists came out and invaded us so\\n\\t\\t\\tseverely that we saw our horses behind our backs. Among the\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople (i.e. the unbelievers) there was a man who was attacking\\n\\t\\t\\tus, and striking and wounding us (with his sword). Allah then\\n\\t\\t\\tdefeated them.

A man from among the companions\\n\\t\\t\\tof the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: I make a vow to myself\\n\\t\\t\\tthat if Allah brings the man who was striking us (with his sword)\\n\\t\\t\\tthat day, I shall behead him. The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon\\n\\t\\t\\thim) kept silent and the man was brought (as a captive).  When he\\n\\t\\t\\tsaw the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him), he said: Apostle of\\n\\t\\t\\tAllah, I have repented to Allah.

He said: Apostle of Allah, why\\n\\t\\t\\tdid you not give any signal to me?

So some of its\\n\\t\\t\\tair and perfume will come to him, and a space will be made for\\n\\t\\t\\thim as far as the eye can see.\\tHe also mentioned the death of\\n\\t\\t\\tthe infidel, saying: His spirit will be restored to his body, two\\n\\t\\t\\tangels will come to him, make him sit up and ask him: Who is your\\n\\t\\t\\tLord?

Then some of its heat and pestilential wind will come to\\n\\t\\t\\thim, and his grave will be compressed, so that his ribs will be\\n\\t\\t\\tcrushed together.

He will give him a blow with it which will be heard by\\n\\t\\t\\teverything between the east and the west except by men and jinn,\\n\\t\\t\\tand he will become dust.
