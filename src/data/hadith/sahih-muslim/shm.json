            "text": "<p>\\n   It is narrated on the authority of Yahya ibn Ya'mar that the\\n   first man who discussed Qadr (Divine Decree) in Basrah was Ma'bad\\n   al-Juhani.  Humayd ibn AbdurRahman al-Himyari and I set out for\\n   Pilgrimage or for Umrah and said: Should it so happen that we\\n   come into contact with one of the Companions of the Messenger of\\n   Allah (peace be upon him) we shall ask him about what is talked\\n   about Taqdir (Division Decree). Accidentally we came across\\n   Abdullah ibn Umar ibn al-Khattab, while he was entering the\\n   mosque. My companion and I surrounded him. One of us (stood) on\\n   his right and the other stood on his left. I expected that my\\n   companion would authorize me to speak. I therefore said:\\n   AbuAbdurRahman! There have appeared some people in our land who\\n   recite the Holy Qur'an and pursue knowledge.  And then after\\n   talking about their affairs, added: They (such people) claim that\\n   there is no such thing as Divine Decree and events are not\\n   predestined.  He (Abdullah ibn Umar) said: When you happen to\\n   meet such people tell them that I have nothing to do with them\\n   and they have nothing to do with me. And verily they are in no\\n   way responsible for my (belief). Abdullah ibn Umar swore by Him\\n   (the Lord) (and said): If any one of them (who does not believe\\n   in the Divine Decree) had with him gold equal to the bulk of (the\\n   mountain) Uhud and then, it (in the way of Allah), Allah would\\n   not accept it unless he affirmed his faith in Divine Decree. He\\n   further said: My father, Umar ibn al-Khattab, told me: One day we\\n   were sitting in the company of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon\\n   him) when there appeared before us a man dressed in pure white\\n   clothes, his hair extraordinarily black. There were no signs of\\n   travel on him. None amongst us recognized him. At last he sat\\n   with the Apostle (peace be upon him) He knelt before him placed\\n   his palms on his thighs and said: Muhammad, inform me about\\n   al-Islam. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:\\n   Al-Islam implies that you testify that there is no god but Allah\\n   and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, and you establish\\n   prayer, pay Zakat, observe the fast of Ramadan, and perform\\n   pilgrimage to the (House) if you are solvent enough (to bear the\\n   expense of) the journey. He (the inquirer) said: You have told\\n   the truth. He (Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: It amazed us that he\\n   would put the question and then he would himself verify the\\n   truth. He (the inquirer) said: Inform me about Iman (faith). He\\n   (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you affirm your faith in Allah,\\n   in His angels, in His Books, in His Apostles, in the Day of\\n   Judgment, and you affirm your faith in the Divine Decree about\\n   good and evil. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth.\\n   He (the inquirer) again said: Inform me about al-Ihsan\\n   (performance of good deeds). He (the Holy Prophet) said: That you\\n   worship Allah as if you are seeing Him, for though you don't see\\n   Him, He, verily, sees you.  He (the enquirer) again said: Inform\\n   me about the hour (of the Doom). He (the Holy Prophet) remarked:\\n   One who is asked knows no more than the one who is inquiring\\n   (about it). He (the inquirer) said: Tell me some of its\\n   indications. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That the slave-girl will\\n   give birth to her mistress and master, that you will find\\n   barefooted, destitute goat-herds vying with one another in the\\n   construction of magnificent buildings. He (the narrator, Umar ibn\\n   al-Khattab) said: Then he (the inquirer) went on his way but I\\n   stayed with him (the Holy Prophet) for a long while. He then,\\n   said to me: Umar, do you know who this inquirer was? I replied:\\n   Allah and His Apostle knows best. He (the Holy Prophet) remarked:\\n   He was Gabriel (the angel). He came to you in order to instruct\\n   you in matters of religion.\\n  </p>"

It therefore pleased us that an intelligent person\\n   from the dwellers of the desert should come and ask him (the Holy\\n   Prophet) and we should listen to it. A man from the dwellers of\\n   the desert came (to the Holy Prophet) and said: Muhammad, your\\n   messenger came to us and told us your assertion that verily Allah\\n   had sent you (as a prophet).

He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. The\\n   narrator said that he (the Bedouin) set off (at the conclusion of\\n   this answer, but at the time of his departure) remarked: By Him\\n   Who sent you with the Truth, I should neither make any addition\\n   to them nor should I remove anything from them.

Direct us to a deed which we\\n   must communicate to those who have been left behind us and by\\n   doing which we may enter Heaven. Upon this the Messenger of Allah\\n   (peace be upon him) said: I enjoin upon you four (things) and\\n   forbid you to do four (things): worship Allah and associate none\\n   with Him, establish prayer, pay Zakat, and observe the fast of\\n   Ramadan, and pay the fifth part out of the booty. And I prohibit\\n   you from four (things): dry gourds, green-coloured jars, hollowed\\n   stumps of palm-trees, and receptacles. They (the members of the\\n   delegation) said: Do you know what an-naqir is?  He replied: Yes,\\n   it is a stump which you hollow out and in which you throw small\\n   dates. Sa'id said: He (the Holy Prophet) used the word tamar\\n   (dates).  (The Holy Prophet then added): Then you sprinkle water\\n   over it and when its fermentation subsides, you drink it (and you\\n   are so intoxicated) that one amongst you, or one amongst them\\n   (the other members of your tribe, who were not present there)\\n   strikes his cousin with the sword.

I however inquired from the Messenger of Allah (peace\\n   be upon him) (if we discard those utensils which you have\\n   forbidden us to use), then what type of vessels should be used\\n   for drink?  (The Holy Prophet) replied: The water-skins the\\n   mouths of which are tied (with a string).

When they have sexual\\n   intercourse and the male's substance (chromosomes and genes)\\n   prevails upon the female's substance (chromosomes and genes), it\\n   is the male child that is created by Allah's Decree. When the\\n   substance of the female prevails upon the substance contributed\\n   by the male, a female child is formed by the Decree of Allah. \\n   The Jew said: What you have said is true; verily you are an\\n   Apostle. He then turned round and went away.  The Messenger of\\n   Allah (peace be upon him) said: He asked me about such and such\\n   things of which I had no knowledge until Allah gave it to me.\\n  </p>"

            "text": "<p>\\n   The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) addressed us and said:\\n   You will travel in the evening and at night until (God willing)\\n   you will come in the morning to a watering-place. So the people\\n   travelled (self-absorbed) without paying any heed to one another,\\n   and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) also travelled\\n   until it was midnight. I was by his side. The Messenger of Allah\\n   (peace be upon him) began to doze and leaned (to one side) of his\\n   camel. I came to him and I lent him support without awaking him\\n   until he sat upright on his mount. He continued to travel until a\\n   major part of the night was over and (he again) leaned (to one\\n   side) of his camel. I supported him without awaking him till he\\n   sat upright on his mount, and then travelled until it was nearly\\n   dawn. He (again) leaned more sharply than on the two earlier\\n   occasions and he was about to fall down. So I came to him and\\n   supported him. He lifted his head and said: Who is this?  I said:\\n   It is AbuQatadah.  He (the Holy Prophet again) said: For how long\\n   have you been travelling with me like this?  I said: I have been\\n   travelling in this very state since midnight.  He said: May Allah\\n   protect you, as you have protected His Apostle (peace be upon\\n   him) (from falling down). He continued: Do you see that we were\\n   hidden from the people? and again said: Do you see anyone?  I\\n   said: Here is a rider. I again said: Here is another rider, until\\n   we gathered together and we were seven riders. The Messenger of\\n   Allah (peace be upon him) stepped off the highway, placed his\\n   head (for sleep and said): Guard for us our prayers. The\\n   Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was the first to wake up\\n   and the rays of the sun were falling on his back. We rose,\\n   startled.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: Ride on. So we rode on\\n   until the sun had (sufficiently) risen. He then came down from\\n   his camel and called for a jug of water that I had with me. There\\n   was a little water in that. With it he performed an ablution that\\n   was less thorough as compared with his usual ablutions when some\\n   of the water was left over. He (the Holy Prophet) said to\\n   AbuQatadah: Keep a watch over your jug of water; it will be on (a\\n   miraculous) condition. Then Bilal summoned (people) to prayer.\\n   The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) observed two rak'ahs\\n   and then said the morning prayer as he said it every day. The\\n   Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) (then) rode on. We rode\\n   with him and some of us whispered to the others, saying: How will\\n   there be compensation for omission in our prayers? Upon this he\\n   (the Apostle of Allah) said: Is there not in my (my life) a model\\n   for you? There is no omission in sleeping. The (cognizable)\\n   omission is that one does not say prayer (intentionally) until\\n   the time of the next prayer comes. So he who does thus (omits\\n   prayer in sleep or due to other unavoidable circumstances) should\\n   say prayer when he becomes aware of it and on the next day he\\n   should observe it at its prescribed time. He (the Holy Prophet)\\n   said: What do you think the people would have done (at this\\n   hour)? They would have found in the morning that their Apostle\\n   was missing from amongst them and then AbuBakr and Umar would\\n   have told them that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)\\n   must be behind them, he could not leave them behind (him), but\\n   the people would have said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon\\n   him) is ahead of you. So if you had obeyed AbuBakr and Umar, you\\n   would have gone on the right path. So we proceeded until we came\\n   up to the people (behind whom we had been lagging). The day had\\n   advanced considerably risen and everything became hot. They (the\\n   companions of the Holy Prophet) said: Messenger of Allah, we are\\n   dying of thirst. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) remarked: There\\n   is no destruction for you. And again said: Bring the small cup of\\n   mine; and then he asked for the jug of water to be brought to\\n   him. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) began to pour\\n   water (into that small cup) and AbuQatadah gave it to them to\\n   drink. When the people saw that there was (a little) water in the\\n   jug, they fell upon it.  Upon this the Messenger of Allah (peace\\n   be upon him) said: Behave well; the water (is enough) to satisfy\\n   all of you. Then they (the companions) began to receive (their\\n   share of) water with calmness (without showing any anxiety). The\\n   Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) continued to fill (the\\n   cup) and I continued to serve them until no one was left except\\n   myself and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). He then\\n   filled (the cup) with water and said to me: Drink it.  I said:\\n   Messenger of Allah, I should not drink until you have drunk. \\n   Upon this he said: The server of the people is the last of them\\n   to drink. So I drank and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon\\n   him) also drank and the people came to the watering-place quite\\n   happy and satisfied. Abdullah ibn Rabah said: I am going to\\n   narrate this hadith in the great mosque, when Imran ibn Husayn\\n   said: See, O young man, how will you narrate it for I was also\\n   one of the riders that night?  I said: So you must know this\\n   hadith well.  He said: Who are you?  I said: I am one of the\\n   Ansar. Upon this he said: You narrate it, for you know your\\n   hadith better. I therefore narrated it to the people.  Imran\\n   said: I was also present that night, but I know not anyone else\\n   who learnt it so well as you have learnt it.\\n  </p>"

He decided to\\n   dispose of his property there and buy arms and horses instead in\\n   order to fight against the Romans to the end of his life. When he\\n   came to Medina he met the people of Medina. They dissuaded him\\n   from doing such a thing, and informed him that a group of six men\\n   had decided to do so during the lifetime of the Apostle of Allah\\n   (peace be upon him) and the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him)\\n   forbade them to do it. He had said: Is there not for you a model\\n   pattern in me? When they narrated this to him (Sa'd ibn Hisham),\\n   he returned to his wife, though he had divorced her and made\\n   (people) witness to his reconciliation. He then came to Ibn Abbas\\n   and asked him about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (peace be\\n   upon him).  Ibn Abbas said: Should I not lead you to one who\\n   knows best amongst the people of the world about the Witr of the\\n   Messenger of Allah? He said: Who is it?  (Ibn Abbas) said: It is\\n   Aisha. So go to her and ask her (about Witr) and then come to me\\n   and inform me of the answer that she gives you. So I came to\\n   Hakim ibn Aflah and requested him to take me to her.  He said: I\\n   shall not go to her, for I forbade her to say anything (about the\\n   conflict) between the two groups, but she refused (to accept my\\n   advice) and went (to participate in the conflict). I (requested)\\n   him (Hakim) with an oath to lead me to her. So we went to Aisha\\n   and we begged permission to meet her. She granted us permission\\n   and we went in.  She said: Are you Hakim? (She recognized him.) \\n   He replied: Yes.  She said: Who is there with you?  He said: He\\n   is Sa'd ibn Hisham.  She said: Which Hisham? He said:  He is\\n   Hisham ibn Amir. She blessed him (Amir) with mercy from Allah and\\n   spoke good of him (Qatadah said that he died as a martyr in\\n   Uhud). I said: Mother of the Faithful, tell me about the\\n   character of the Messenger of Allah.  She said: Don't you read\\n   the Qur'an?  I said: Yes.  Upon this she said: The character of\\n   the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) was the Qur'an. He said:\\n   I felt inclined to stand up and not ask anything (further) until\\n   death. But then I changed my mind and said: Inform me about the\\n   observance (of the night prayer) of the Messenger of Allah (peace\\n   be upon him)  She said: Did you not recite: \"O thou wrapped up\"? \\n   He said: Yes.  She said: Allah, the Exalted and the Glorious,\\n   made the observance of the night prayer at the beginning of this\\n   Surah obligatory. So the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) and\\n   his companions around him observed this (night prayer) for one\\n   year. Allah held back the concluding portion of this Surah for\\n   twelve months in Heaven until (at the end of this period) Allah\\n   revealed the concluding verses of this Surah, which lightened\\n   (the burden of this prayer), and the night prayer became a\\n   supererogatory prayer after being an obligatory one. I said:\\n   Mother of the Faithful, inform me about the Witr of the Messenger\\n   of Allah (peace be upon him).  She said: I used to prepare a\\n   tooth-stick for him and water for his ablution, and Allah would\\n   rouse him to the extent He wished during the night. He would use\\n   the tooth stick,  perform ablution, and would offer nine rak'ahs.\\n   He would only sit for the eighth one and would remember Allah,\\n   praise Him and supplicate Him, then he would stand up without\\n   uttering the salutation and pray the ninth rak'ah. He would then\\n   sit, remember Him, praise Him and supplicate Him and then utter a\\n   salutation loud enough for us to hear. He would then pray two\\n   rak'ahs sitting after uttering the salutation, and that made\\n   eleven rak'ahs.  However, my son, when the Apostle of Allah\\n   (peace be upon him) grew old and put on flesh, he observed a Witr\\n   of seven, doing in two rak'ahs as he had done formerly, and that\\n   made nine. O my son, when the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon\\n   him) observed prayer, he liked to continue observing it, and when\\n   sleep or pain overpowered him and made it impossible (for him) to\\n   observe prayer at night, he prayed twelve rak'ahs during the day.\\n   I am not aware of Allah's Prophet (peace be upon him) having\\n   recited the whole Qur'an during one single night, or praying\\n   through the night till morning, or fasting a complete month,\\n   except Ramadan. He (narrator) said: I then went to Ibn Abbas and\\n   narrated to him the hadith (transmitted from her), and he said:\\n   She says the truth. If I went to her and were admitted into her\\n   presence, I should have listened to it orally from her.  He said:\\n   If I had known that you did not go to her, I should not have\\n   transmitted this hadith to you, narrated by her.\\n  </p>"

Meanwhile I heard of a man in Mecca who was\\n   giving news (on the basis of his prophetic knowledge); so I\\n   mounted and rode to him. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon\\n   him) was at that time hiding as his people had made life hard for\\n   him. I adopted a friendly attitude (towards the Meccans and thus\\n   managed) to enter Mecca and go to him (the Holy Prophet).  I said\\n   to him: Who are you?  He said: I am a Prophet (of Allah).  I\\n   again said: What is a Prophet? He said: (I am a Prophet in the\\n   sense that) I have been sent by Allah. I said: What have you\\n   been sent to do?  He said: I have been sent to join ties of\\n   relationship (with kindness and affection), to break the idols,\\n   and to proclaim the oneness of Allah (in a manner that) nothing\\n   is to be associated with Him.  I said: Who is with you in this\\n   (in these beliefs and practices)? He said: A free man and a\\n   slave. He (the narrator) said: AbuBakr and Bilal were there with\\n   him among those who had embraced Islam by that time.  I said: It\\n   intend to follow you.  He said: During these days you will not be\\n   able to do so. Don't you see the (hard) conditions under which I\\n   and (my) people are living? You had better go back to your people\\n   and when you hear that I have been granted victory, you come to\\n   me.  So I went to my family. I was in my home when the Messenger\\n   of Allah (peace be upon him) came to Medina. I was among my\\n   people and used to seek news and ask people when he arrived in\\n   Medina. Then a group of people belonging to Yathrib (Medina)\\n   came.  I said (to them): How is that person, who has come to\\n   Medina, faring?  They said: The people are hastening to him,\\n   while his people (the polytheists of Mecca) planned to kill him\\n   but they could not do so.  I (on hearing it) came to Medina and\\n   went to him and said: Messenger of Allah, do you recognize me? \\n   He said: Yes, you are the same man who met me at Mecca.  I said:\\n   It is so.  I again said: Prophet of Allah, tell me that which\\n   Allah has taught you and which I do not know, tell me about the\\n   prayer.  He said: Observe the dawn prayer, then stop praying when\\n   the sun is rising until it is fully ,risen for when it rises it\\n   comes up between the horns of Satan, and the unbelievers\\n   prostrate themselves to it at that time. Then pray, for the\\n   prayer is witnessed and attended (by angels) until the shadow\\n   becomes about the length of a lance; then cease prayer, for at\\n   that time Hell is heated up. Then when the shadow moves forward,\\n   pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended by angels, until\\n   you pray the afternoon prayer. Then cease prayer until the sun\\n   sets, for it sets between the horns of the Devil, and at that\\n   time the unbelievers prostrate themselves before it.  I said:\\n   Apostle of Allah, tell me about ablution also. He said: He who\\n   uses water for ablution, rinses his mouth, snuffs up water and\\n   blows it out, the sins of his face, his mouth and his nostrils\\n   will be washed away. When he washes his face, as Allah has\\n   commanded him, the sins of his face are carried away from the end\\n   of his beard with the water. Then (when) he washes his forearms\\n   up to the elbows, the sins of his arms are carried away with the\\n   water from his finger-tips. When he wipes his head, the sins of\\n   his head are carried away from the ends of his hair with the\\n   water. And (when) he washes his feet up to the ankles, the sins\\n   of his feet are carried away from his toes with the water. And if\\n   he stands to pray and praises Allah, lauds Him, glorifies Him\\n   with what becomes Him and shows wholehearted devotion to Allah,\\n   his sins will depart, leaving him (as innocent) as he was on the\\n   day his mother bore him.  Amr ibn Abasah narrated this hadith to\\n   AbuUmamah, a companion of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon\\n   him), and AbuUmamah said to him: Amr ibn Abasah, think of what\\n   you are saying; that such (a great reward) is given to a man in\\n   one place (only in the act of ablution and prayer).  Upon this\\n   Amr said: AbuUmamah, I have grown old my bones have become weak\\n   and I am at death's door; what reason is there for me to\\n   attribute a lie to Allah and the Messenger of Allah (peace be\\n   upon him)? Had I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (peace be\\n   upon him) once, twice, or three times (even seven times), I\\n   should have never narrated it, but I have heard it from him on\\n   more occasions than these.\\n  </p>"

Whenever\\n   these cool down, (the process is) repeated for a day, the extent\\n   of which will be fifty thousand years, until judgment is\\n   pronounced upon the servants, and he sees whether his path is to\\n   take him to Paradise or to Hell. It was said: Messenger of Allah,\\n   what about the camel?  He (the Holy Prophet) said: If any owner\\n   of the camel does not pay what is due from him, and of hid due in\\n   that (camel) is (also) to milk it on the day when it comes down\\n   to water, when the Day of Resurrection comes, a soft sandy plain\\n   will be set for him, as extensive as possible. (He will find)\\n   that not a single young one is missing, and they will trample him\\n   with their hoofs and bite him with their mouths. As often as the\\n   first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return\\n   for a day, the extent of which will be fifty thousand years,\\n   until judgment is pronounced upon the servants and he sees\\n   whether his path is to take him to Paradise or to Hell. It was\\n   (again) said: Messenger of Allah, what about cows (cattle) and\\n   sheep? He said: If any owner of the cattle and sheep does not\\n   pay what is due on them, when the Day of Resurrection comes, a\\n   soft sandy plain will be spread for them. He will find none of\\n   them missing, with twisted horns, without horns or with a broken\\n   horn, and they will gore him with their horns and trample him\\n   with their hoofs. As often as the first of them passes him the\\n   last of them will be made to return to him for a day, the extent\\n   of which will be fifty thousand years, until judgment is\\n   pronounced upon the servants. And he would be shown his Path\\n   leading him to Paradise or to Hell. It was said: Messenger of\\n   Allah, what about the horse?  Upon this he said: The horses are\\n   of three types. To one man (these are) burden, and to another man\\n   (these are) a covering, and still to another man (these are) a\\n   source of reward. The one to whom these are a burden is the\\n   person who rears them in order to show off, for vainglory and for\\n   opposing the Muslims; so they are a burden to him. The one for\\n   whom these are a covering is the person who rears them for the\\n   sake of Allah but does not forget the right of Allah concerning\\n   their backs and their necks, and so they are a covering for him.\\n   As for those which bring reward (these refer to) the person who\\n   rears them for the sake of Allah, to be used for Muslims, so he\\n   puts them in meadows and fields. And whatever they eat from those\\n   meadows and fields will be recorded on his behalf as good deeds,\\n   as will also the amount of their dung and urine. They will not\\n   break their halters and prance a course or two without having\\n   recorded the amount of their hoof marks and their dung as a good\\n   deed on his behalf (on behalf of their owner). And their master\\n   does not bring them past a river from which they drink, though he\\n   did not intend to quench their thirst, but Allah will record for\\n   him the amount of what they drink on his behalf as good deeds. It\\n   was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the asses?  Upon this he\\n   said: Nothing has been revealed to me in regard to the asses (in\\n   particular) except this one verse of a comprehensive nature: \"He\\n   who does an atom weight of good will see it, and he who does an\\n   atom weight of evil will see it\" (xcix.7).\\n  </p>"

When they had assembled, the Messenger of Allah\\n   (peace be upon him) came to them and said: What is this news that\\n   has reached me from you?  The wise people of the Ansar said:\\n   Messenger of Allah, so far as the sagacious amongst us are\\n   concerned they have said nothing, but we have amongst us persons\\n   of immature age; they said: May Allah grant pardon to the\\n   Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that he gave to the\\n   Quraysh and ignored us (despite the fact) that our swords are\\n   besmeared with their blood.  Upon this the Messenger of Allah\\n   (peace be upon him) said: I give (at times material gifts) to\\n   persons who were quite recently in the state of unbelief, so that\\n   I may incline them to truth. Don't you feel delighted that people\\n    go with riches whereas you should go back to your places with\\n   the Apostle of Allah? By Allah, that with which you return is\\n   better than that with which they  return.  They said: Yes,\\n   Messenger of Allah, we are pleased. The Holy Prophet said too:\\n   You will find marked preference (in conferring of the material\\n   gifts) in future, so you should show patience until you meet\\n   Allah and His Messenger and I shall be at the Hawd Kawthar. They\\n   said: We show patience.\\n  </p>"

I said: I\\n   am Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Husayn. He placed his hand upon my head\\n   and opened my upper button and then the lower one and then placed\\n   his palm on my chest (in order to bless me), and I was, during\\n   those days, a young boy, and he said: You are welcome, my nephew.\\n   Ask whatever you want to ask. And I asked him but as he was blind\\n   (he could not respond to me immediately), and the time for prayer\\n   came. He stood up covering himself in his mantle. And whenever he\\n   placed its ends upon his shoulders they slipped down on account\\n   of being short (in size). Another mantle was, however, lying on\\n   the clothes rack near by and he led us in the prayer.  I said to\\n   him: Tell me about the Hajj of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon\\n   him) stayed in (Medina) for nine years but did not perform Hajj,\\n   then he made a public announcement in the tenth year to the\\n   effect that Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) was about to\\n   perform the Hajj. A large number of persons came to Medina and\\n   all of them were anxious to follow the Messenger of Allah (peace\\n   be upon him) and do according to his doing. We set out with him\\n   till we reached Dhul-Hulayfah. Asma daughter of Umays gave birth\\n   to Muhammad ibn AbuBakr. She sent message to the Messenger of\\n   Allah (peace be upon him) asking him: What should I do? He (the\\n   Holy Prophet) said: Take a bath, bandage your private parts and\\n   put on Ihram. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be Upon him) then\\n   prayed in the mosque and then mounted al-Qaswa (his she-camel)\\n   and it stood erect with him on its back at al-Bayda'.  And I saw\\n   as far as I could see in front of me but riders and pedestrians,\\n   and also on my right and on my left and behind me like this. And\\n   the Messenger of Allah (may peace be him) was prominent among us\\n   and the (revelation) of the Holy Qur'an was descending upon him.\\n   And it is he who knows (its true) significance. And whatever he\\n   did, we also did that. He pronounced the Oneness of Allah\\n   (saying): \"Labbayk, O Allah, Labbayk, Labbayk, Thou hast no\\n   partner, praise and grace is Thine and the Sovereignty too; Thou\\n   hast no partner.\" And the people also pronounced this Talbiyah\\n   which they pronounce (today). The Messenger of Allah (my peace be\\n   upon him) did not reject anything out of it. But the Messenger of\\n   Allah (peace be upon him) adhered to his own Talbiyah. Jabir\\n   said: We did not have any other intention but that of Hajj only,\\n   being unaware of the Umrah (at that season), but when we came\\n   with him to the House, he touched the pillar, and (made seven\\n   circuits) running three of them and walking four. And then going\\n   to the Station of Ibrahim, he rejected: \"And adopt the Station of\\n   Ibrahim as a place of prayer.\" And this Station was between him\\n   and the House. My father said (and I do not know whether he had\\n   made a mention of it but that was from Allah's Apostle (peace be\\n   upon him) that he recited in two rak'ahs: \"say: He is Allah One,\\n   \" and say: \"Say : O unbelievers.\" He then returned to the pillar\\n   (Hajar Aswad) and kissed it. He then went out of the gate to\\n   as-Safa and as he reached near it he recited: \"As-Safa and\\n   al-Marwah are among the signs appointed by Allah, (adding:) I\\n   begin with what Allah (has commanded me) to begin. He first\\n   mounted as-Safa' till he saw the House, and facing Qiblah he\\n   declared the Oneness of Allah and glorified Him, and said: \"There\\n   is no god but Allah, One, there is no partner with Him. His is\\n   the Sovereignty, to Him praise is due, and He is Powerful over\\n   everything. There is no god but Allah alone, Who fulfilled His\\n   promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates alone.\"\\n   He then made supplication in the course of that saying such words\\n   three times. He then descended and walked towards al-Marwah, and\\n   when his feet came down in the bottom of the valley, he ran, and\\n   when he began to ascend he walked till he reached al-Marwah.\\n   There he did as he had done at as-Safa.  And when it was his last\\n   running at al-Marwah he said: If I had know beforehand what I\\n   have come to know afterwards, I would not have brought\\n   sacrificial animals and would have performed an Umrah. So, he who\\n   among you has not the sacrificial animals with him should put off\\n   Ihram and treat it as an Umrah. Suraqah ibn Malik ibn Ju'sham got\\n   up and said: Messenger of Allah, does it apply to the present\\n   year, or does it apply for ever? Thereupon the Messenger of Allah\\n   (peace be upon him) intertwined the fingers (of one hand) into\\n   another and said twice: The `Umrah has become incorporated in the\\n   Hajj (adding): \"No, but for ever and ever.\"  Ali came from the\\n   Yemen with the sacrificial animals for the Prophet (peace be upon\\n   him) and found Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her) to be one\\n   among those who had put off Ihram and had put on dyed clothes and\\n   had applied antimony. He (Ali) showed disapproval to it,\\n   whereupon she said: My father has commanded me to do this. (The\\n   narrator) said that Ali said that Ali used to say in Iraq: I went\\n   to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) showing annoyance\\n   at Fatimah for what she had done, and asked the (verdict) of\\n   Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) regarding what she had\\n   narrated from him, and told him that I was angry with her,\\n   whereupon` he said: She has told the truth, she has told the\\n   truth. (The Holy Prophet then asked Ali): What did you say when\\n   you undertook to go for Hajj? I (Ali) said: O Allah, I am putting\\n   on Ihram for the same purpose as Thy Messenger has put it on. He\\n   said: I have with me sacrificial animals, so do not put off the\\n   Ihram. He (Jabir) said: The total number of those sacrificial\\n   animals brought by Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the\\n   Apostle (peace be upon him) was one hundred. Then all the people\\n   except the Apostle (peace be upon him) and those who had with\\n   them sacrificial animals, put off Ihram, and got their hair\\n   clipped; when it was the day of Tarwiyah (8th of Dhul-Hijjah)\\n   they went to Mina and put on the Ihram for Hajj and the Messenger\\n   of Allah (peace be upon him) rode and led the noon, afternoon,\\n   sunset Isha' and dawn prayers. He then waited a little till the\\n   sun rose, and commanded that a tent of hair should be pitched at\\n   Namirah. \\n  </p>"

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon\\n   him) then mounted his camel and came to the place of stay, making\\n   his she-camel al-Qaswa turn towards the side where there were\\n   rocks, having the path taken by those who went on foot in front\\n   of him, and faced the Qiblah. He kept standing there till the sun\\n   set, and the yellow light had somewhat gone, and the disc of the\\n   sun had disappeared.

He then went quickly before\\n   the sun rose, and seated behind him was al-Fadl ibn Abbas, and he\\n   was a man having beautiful hair and fair complexion and handsome\\n   face.

Thereupon he\\n   (the Holy Prophet) said: Allah, solve (this problem), and he\\n   began to supplicate (before Him).  Then the verses pertaining to\\n   li'an were revealed: \"Those who accuse their wives and have no\\n   witness except themselves\" (xxiv.6).

He (the\\n   Holy Prophet) said: (Yours is a great fault). I (my men) have\\n   captured of you for the crime of your allies, Banu Thaqif. He\\n   (the Holy Prophet) then turned away.

            "text": "<p>\\n   We arrived at Hudaybiyyah with the Messenger of Allah (peace be\\n   upon him) and we were fourteen hundred in number. There were\\n   fifty goats with us which could not be watered (by the small\\n   quantity of water in the local well). So, the Messenger of Allah\\n   (peace be upon him) sat on the brink of the well. Either he\\n   prayed or spat into the well. The water welled up. We drank and\\n   watered (the beasts as well). Then the Messenger of Allah (may\\n   peace be upon  him) called us to take the vow of allegiance, as\\n   he was sitting at the base of a tree. I was the first man to take\\n   the oath. Then other people took the oath. When half the number\\n   of people had done so, he said to me: You take the oath, Salamah.\\n   I said: I was one of those who took the vow in the first\\n   instance. He said: (you may do) again. Then the Messenger of\\n   Allah (peace be upon him) saw that I was without weapons. He gave\\n   me a big or a small shield. Then he continued to administer vows\\n   to the people until it was the last batch of them. He said (to\\n   me): Won't you swear allegiance, Salamah? I said: Messenger of\\n   Allah, I took the oath with the first batch of the people and\\n   then again when you were in the middle of the people. He said:\\n   (Doesn't matter), you may (do so) again. So I took the oath of\\n   allegiance thrice. Then he said to me: Salamah, where is the\\n   shield which I gave to thee? I said: Messenger of Allah,  my\\n   uncle Amir met me and he was without any weapons. So I gave the\\n   shield to him. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) laughed\\n   and said: You are like a person of the days gone by who said: O\\n   God, I seek a friend who is dearer to me than myself. (When all\\n   Companions had sworn allegiance to the Holy Prophet), the\\n   polytheists sent messages of peace, until people could move from\\n   our camp to that of the Meccans and vice versa. Finally, the\\n   peace treaty was concluded. I was a dependant of Talhah bin\\n   Ubaydullah. I watered his horse and rubbed its back.  I served\\n   Talhah (doing odd jobs for him) and partook from his food. I had\\n   left my  family and my property as an emigrant in the cause of\\n   Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him). When we and the\\n   people of Mecca had concluded a peace treaty  and the people of\\n   one side began to mix with those of the other, I came to a tree,\\n   swept away its thorns and lay down (for rest) at its base. (While\\n   I lay there), four of the polytheists from the Meccans came to me\\n   and began to talk ill of the Messenger of  Allah (peace be upon\\n   him). I got enraged with them and moved to another tree. They\\n   hung their weapons (to the branches of the trees) and lay down\\n   (for rest). (While they lay there), somebody from the lower part\\n   of the valley cried out: Run up, O Muhajirs! Ibn Zunaym has been\\n   murdered. I drew my sword and attacked these four while they were\\n   asleep. I seized their arms and collected them up in my hand, and\\n   said: By the Being Who has conferred honour upon Muhammad, none\\n   of you shall raise his head, else I will smite his face. (Then) I\\n   came driving them along to the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him).\\n   (At the same time), my uncle Amir came (to him) with a man from\\n   Abalat called Mikraz. Amir was dragging him on a horse with a\\n   thick covering on its back along with seventy polytheists. The\\n   Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) cast a glance at them and\\n   said: Let them go (so that) they may prove guilty of breach of\\n   trust more than once (before we take action against them). So the\\n   Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forgave them. On this\\n   occasion, God revealed the Qur'anic verse: \"It is He Who\\n   restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the\\n   valley of Mecca after He has granted you a victory over them\"\\n   (xiviii.24).  Then we started moving back to Medina, and halted\\n   at a place  where there was a mountain between us and Banu Libyan\\n   who were polytheists. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)\\n   asked God's forgiveness for one who ascended the mountain at\\n   night to act as a scout for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon\\n   him) and his Companions. I ascended (that mountain) twice or\\n   thrice that night.\\n  </p>"

I (also) went to the pasture with the horse of Talhah along\\n   with the camels. When the day dawned, AbdurRahman al-Fazari made\\n   a raid and drove away all the camels of the Messenger of Allah\\n   (peace be upon him), and killed the man who looked after them. I\\n   said: Rabah, ride this horse, take it to Talhah ibn Ubaydullah\\n   and inform the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that the\\n   polytheists have made away with his camels. Then I stood upon a\\n   hillock and turning my face to Medina, shouted thrice: Come to\\n   our help! Then I set out in pursuit of the raiders, shooting at\\n   them with arrows and chanting a (self-eulogising) verse in the\\n   Iambic meter:  I am the son of al-Akwa' And today is the day of\\n   defeat for the mean. I would overtake a man from them, shoot at\\n   him an arrow which, piercing through the saddle, would reach his\\n   shoulder, and I would say: Take it, chanting at the same time the\\n   verse: And I am the son of al-Akwa' And today is the day of\\n   defeat for the mean. By God, I continued shooting at them and\\n   hamstringing their animals. Whenever a horseman turned upon me, I\\n   would come to a tree and (hid myself) sitting at its base. Then I\\n   would shoot at him and hamstring his horse. (At last) they\\n   entered a narrow mountain gorge. I ascended that mountain and\\n   held them at bay throwing stones at them. I continued to chase\\n   them in this way until I got all the camels of the Messenger of\\n   Allah (peace be upon him) released and no camel was left with\\n   them. They left me; then I followed them shooting at them\\n   (continually) until they dropped more than thirty mantles and\\n   thirty lances, lightening their burden. On everything they\\n   dropped, I put a mark with the help of (a piece of) stone so that\\n   the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and his Companions\\n   might recognise them (that it was booty left by the enemy). (They\\n   went on) until they came to a narrow valley when so and so, son\\n   of Badr al-Fazari joined them. They (now), sat down to take their\\n   breakfast and I sat on the top of a tapering rock. Al-Fazari\\n   said: Who is that fellow I am seeing? They said: This fellow has\\n   harassed us. By God, he has not left us since dusk and has been\\n   (continually) shooting at us until he has snatched everything\\n   from our hands. He said: Four of you should make a dash at him\\n   (and kill him).  (Accordingly), four of them ascended the\\n   mountain coming towards me. When it became possible for me to\\n   talk to them, I said: Do you recognise me? They said: No. Who art\\n   thou? I said: I am Salamah, son of al-Akwa'. By the Being Who has\\n   honoured the countenance of Muhammad (peace be upon him) I can\\n   kill any of you I like but none of you will be able to kill me.\\n   One of them said: I think (he is right). So they returned. I did\\n   not move from my place until I saw the horsemen of the Messenger\\n   of Allah (peace be upon him), who came riding through the trees.\\n   Lo! the foremost among them was Akhram al-Asadi. Behind him was\\n   AbuQatadah al-Ansari and behind him was al-Miqdad bin al-Aswad\\n   al-Kindi.  I caught hold of the rein of Akhram's horse. (Seeing\\n   this), they (the raiders) fled. I said (to Akhram): Akhram, guard\\n   yourself against them until Allah's Messenger and his Companions\\n   join you. He said: O Salamah, if you believe in Allah and the Day\\n   of Judgment and (if) you know that Paradise is a reality and Hell\\n   is a reality, you should not stand between me and martyrdom. So I\\n   let him go. Akhram and AbdurRahman (Fazari) met in combat. Akhram\\n   hamstrung AbdurRahman's horse and the latter struck him with his\\n   lance and killed him. AbdurRahman turned about riding Akhram's\\n   horse. AbuQatadah, a horseman of the Messenger of Allah (peace be\\n   upon him), met AbdurRahman (in combat), smote him with his lance\\n   and killed him. By the Being Who honoured the countenance of\\n   Muhammad (peace be upon him), I followed them running on my feet\\n   (so fast) that I couldn't see behind me the Companions of\\n   Muhammad (peace be upon him), nor any dust raised by their\\n   horses. (I followed them) until before sunset they reached a\\n   valley which had a spring of water, which was called Dhu Qarad,\\n   so that they could have a drink, for they were thirsty. They saw\\n   me running towards them. I turned them out of the valley before\\n   they could drink a drop of its water. They left the valley and\\n   ran down a slope. I ran (behind them), overtook a man from them,\\n   shot him with an arrow through the shoulder blade and said: Take\\n   this. I am the son of al-Akwa';  And today is the day of\\n   annihilation for the people who are mean. The fellow (who was\\n   wounded) said: May his mother sweep over him! Are you the Akwa'\\n   who has been chasing us since morning? I said: Yes, O enemy of\\n   thyself, the same Akwa'. They left two horses dead tired on the\\n   hillock and I came dragging them along to the Messenger of Allah\\n   (peace be upon him). I met Amir who had with him a container\\n   having milk diluted with water and a container having water. I\\n   performed ablution with the water and drank the milk.\\n  </p>"

(On the way) my uncle, Amir, began to recite the following\\n   rajaz verses for the people: By God, if Thou hadst not guided us\\n   aright, We would have neither practised charity nor offered\\n   prayers. (O God!) We cannot do without Thy favours; Keep us\\n   steadfast when we encounter the enemy, And descend tranquillity\\n   upon us.

Umar bin al-Khattab who was riding on his\\n   camel called out: Prophet of Allah, I wish you had allowed us to\\n   benefit from Amir. Salamah continued: When we reached Khaybar,\\n   its king named Marhab advanced brandishing his sword and\\n   chanting: Khaybar knows that I am Marhab (who behaves like) A\\n   fully armed, and well-tried warrior, When the war comes spreading\\n   its flames. My uncle, Amir, came out to combat with him, saying:\\n   Khaybar certainly knows that I am Amir, A fully armed veteran who\\n   plunges into battles. They exchanged blows. Marhab's sword struck\\n   the shield of Amir who bent forward to attack his opponent from\\n   below, but his sword recoiled upon him and cut the main artery in\\n   his forearm which caused his death. Salamah said: I came out and\\n   heard some people among the Companions of the Holy Prophet (peace\\n   be upon him) as saying): Amir's deed has gone waste; he has\\n   killed himself. So I came to the  Holy Prophet (peace be upon\\n   him) weeping and I said: Messenger of Allah, has Amir's deed gone\\n   waste? The Messenger (peace be upon him) said: Who passed this\\n   remark? I said: Some of your Companions. He said: He who has\\n   passed that remark has told a lie, for Amir there is a double\\n   reward.  Then he sent me to Ali who had sore eyes, and said: I\\n   will give the banner to a man who loves Allah and His Messenger\\n   or whom Allah and His Messenger love. So I went to Ali, brought\\n   him beading him along as he had sore eyes, and I took him to the\\n   Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), who applied his saliva to\\n   his eyes and he got well. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon\\n   him) gave him the banner (and Ali went to meet Marhab in a single\\n   combat). The latter advanced chanting: Khaybar knows certainly\\n   that I am Marhab, A fully armed and well-tried valorous warrior\\n   (hero) When war comes spreading its flames. Ali chanted in reply:\\n   I am the one whose mother named him Haydar, (And am) like a lion\\n   of the forest with a terror-striking countenance. I give my\\n   opponents the measure of sandara in exchange for sa' (i.e. return\\n   their attack with one that is much more fierce).

(In this phase of the Ummah), there will be\\n   tremendous trials, one after the other, each making the previous\\n   one dwindle into insignificance. When they are afflicted with a\\n   trial, the believer will say: This is going to bring about my\\n   destruction. When (the trial) is over, they will be afflicted\\n   with another trial and the believer will say: This surely is\\n   going to be my end.  Whoever wishes to be delivered from the Fire\\n   and enter the Garden should die with faith in Allah and the Last\\n   Day and should treat the people as he wishes to be treated by\\n   them. He who swears allegiance to a Caliph should give him the\\n   pledge of his hand and the sincerity of his heart (i.e. submit to\\n   him both outwardly as well as inwardly). He should obey him to\\n   the best of his capacity. If another man comes forward (as a\\n   claimant to Caliphate), disputing his authority, they (the\\n   Muslims) should behead the latter.  The narrator says: I came\\n   close to him (Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As) and said to him: Can\\n   you say on oath that you heard it from the Messenger of Allah\\n   (peace be upon him)?  He pointed with his hands to his ears and\\n   his heart and said: My ears heard it and my mind retained it.  I\\n   said to him: This cousin of yours, Mu'awiyah, orders us to\\n   consume our wealth unjustly among ourselves and to kill one\\n   another, while Allah says: \"O ye who believe, do not consume your\\n   wealth among yourselves unjustly, unless it be trade based on\\n   mutual agreement, and do not kill yourselves.

My brother Unays, our mother and I stayed\\n   with our maternal uncle who treated us well.  The men of his\\n   tribe felt jealous and they said: When you are away from your\\n   house, Unays commits adultery with your wife. Our maternal uncle\\n   came and he accused us of the sin about which he had been\\n   informed.  I said: You have undone the good you did to us. We\\n   cannot stay with you after this. We came to our camels and loaded\\n   (our) luggage. Our maternal uncle began to weep, covering himself\\n   with (a piece of) cloth. We proceeded until we encamped by the\\n   side of Mecca. Unays cast lot on the camels (we had) and an equal\\n   number (above that). They both went to a Kahin and he made Unays\\n   win and Unays came with our camels and an equal number along with\\n   them. He (AbuDharr) said: My nephew, I used to observe prayer\\n   three years before my meeting with Allah's Messenger (peace be\\n   upon him).  I said: To whom did you say your prayer?  He said: To\\n   Allah. I said: In which direction did you turn your face (for\\n   observing prayer)?  He said: I used to turn my face as Allah has\\n   directed me to turn my face. I used to observe the night prayer\\n   towards the end of night and I fell down in prostration like a\\n   mantle until the sun rose over me. Unays said: I have work in\\n   Mecca, so you had better stay here. Unays continued until he came\\n   to Mecca and he came back to me late.  I said: What did you do? \\n   He said: I met a person in Mecca who is of your religion and he\\n   claims that verily it is Allah Who has sent him.  I said: What do\\n   the people say about him? He said: They say that he is a poet or\\n   a Kahin or magician. Unays who was himself one of the poets said:\\n   I have heard the words of a Kahin but his words in no way\\n   resemble his (words). I also compared his words with the verses\\n   of poets but such words cannot be uttered by any poet. By Allah,\\n   he is truthful and they are liars.  Then I said: You stay here\\n   while I go to see him. He said: I came to Mecca and I selected an\\n   insignificant person from amongst them and said to him: Where is\\n   he whom you call a Sabi?  He pointed towards me, saying: He is\\n   Sabi. Thereupon the people of the valley attacked me with sods\\n   and bows until I fell down unconscious. I stood up after\\n   regaining consciousness and I found that I resembled a red idol.\\n   I came to Zamzam, washed blood from myself and drank water from\\n   it. Listen, O son of my brother, I stayed there for thirty nights\\n   or days and there was no food for me but the water of Zamzam. And\\n   I became so emaciated that there appeared wrinkles upon my\\n   stomach, yet I did not feel any hunger in my stomach. It was\\n   during this time that the people of Mecca slept during the\\n   moonlit night and there was none to circumambulate the House\\n   except two women who had been invoking the name of Isafa and\\n   Na'ilah (the two idols). They came to me while on their circuit\\n   and I said: Marry one to the other, but they did not dissuade\\n   from their invocation. They came to me and I said to them: Insert\\n   wood (in the idols' private parts). (I said this to them in such\\n   plain words) as I could not express it in metaphorical terms.\\n   These women went away crying and saying: Had there been one\\n   amongst our people (he would have taught a lesson to you for the\\n   obscene words used for our idols before us). These women met\\n   Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and AbuBakr who had also\\n   been coming down the hill.  He asked them: What has happened to\\n   you?  They said: It is Sabi, who has hidden himself between the\\n   Ka'bah and its curtain.  He said: What did he say to you?  They\\n   said: He uttered such words before us as we cannot express.\\n   Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) came and he kissed the\\n   Black Stone, circumambulated the House along with his companion\\n   and then observed prayer. AbuDharr said: When he had finished his\\n   prayer, I was the first to greet him with the salutation of peace\\n   and uttered (the words) in this way Allah's Messenger, may there\\n   be peace upon you. Thereupon he said: May it be upon you too, and\\n   the mercy of Allah. He then said: Who are you? I said: From the\\n   tribe of Ghifar.  He praised his hand and placed his finger on\\n   his forehead and I said to myself: Perhaps he does not like my\\n   belonging to the tribe of Ghifar. I attempted to catch hold of\\n   his hand but his friend, who knew about him more than I,\\n   dissuaded me from doing so. He then lifted his head and said: For\\n   how long have you been here?  I said: I have been here for the\\n   last thirty nights or days.  He said: Who has been feeding you? \\n   I said: There has been no food for me but the water of Zamzam. I\\n   have grown so emaciated that there are wrinkles upon my stomach\\n   and I do not feel any hunger. He said: It is blessed (water) and\\n   it also serves as food. Thereupon AbuBakr said: Allah's\\n   Messenger, let me serve as a host to him for tonight. Then\\n   Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) proceeded forth, so did\\n   AbuBakr, and I went with them. AbuBakr opened the door and then\\n   he brought for us the raisins of Ta'if and that was the first\\n   food which I ate there. Then I stayed as long as I had to stay. I\\n   then came to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and he said: I\\n   have been shown the land abounding in trees and I think it must\\n   be that of Yathrib (that is the old name of Medina). You are a\\n   preacher to your people on my behalf. I hope Allah will benefit\\n   them through you and He will reward you.  I came to Unays and he\\n   said: What have you done?  I said: What I have done is to embrace\\n   Islam and testify (to the prophethood of Allah's Messenger). He\\n   said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace\\n   Islam and testify (to the prophethood of Muhammad). Then both of\\n   us came to our mother and she said: I have no aversion for your\\n   religion and I also embrace Islam and testify to the prophethood\\n   of Muhammad. We then loaded our camels and came to our tribe\\n   Ghifar and half of the tribe embraced Islam and their chief was\\n   Ayma' ibn Rahadah Ghifari and he was their leader and half of the\\n   tribe said: We will embrace Islam when Allah's Messenger (peace\\n   be upon him) would come to Medina, and when Allah's Messenger\\n   (peace be upon him) came to Medina the remaining half also\\n   embraced Islam. Then the tribe Aslam came to the Holy Prophet\\n   (peace be upon him) and said: Allah's Messenger, we also embrace\\n   Islam like our brothers who have embraced Islam. And they also\\n   embraced Islam. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him)\\n   said: Allah granted pardon to the tribe of Ghifar and Allah saved\\n   (from destruction) the tribe of Aslam.\\n  </p>"

He then sent (someone) to Ka'b ibn Malik (to do\\n   the same, but what he composed did not appeal to the Holy\\n   Prophet). He then sent one to Hassan ibn Thabit. As he entered\\n   his presence, Hassan said: Now you have called for this lion who\\n   strikes (the enemies) with his tail. He then brought out his\\n   tongue and began to move it and said: By Him Who has sent you\\n   with Truth, I shall tear them with my tongue as the leather is\\n   torn.

I have only said that you will see after\\n   some time an important event: that the (sacred) House (Ka'bah)\\n   will be burnt and it definitely happen.  He then reported that\\n   Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: The Dajjal will\\n   appear in my Ummah and he will stay (in the world) for forty--I\\n   cannot say whether he meant forty days, forty months or forty\\n   years. Allah will then send Jesus, son of Mary, who will resemble\\n   Urwah ibn Mas'ud. He (Jesus Christ) will chase him and kill him.\\n   Then people will live for seven years, during which time there\\n   will be no rancour between any two persons. After that Allah will\\n   send a cold wind from the direction of Syria. None will survive\\n   on Earth, having a speck of good in him or faith in him: he will\\n   die. Even if some among you were to enter the innermost part of\\n   the mountain, this wind would reach that place also and cause\\n   your death.

He will command them to worship\\n   the idols but, in spite of this, they will have an abundance of\\n   sustenance and lead comfortable lives.

Then the second trumpet will be blown and\\n   they will stand up and begin to look (around). Then it will be\\n   said: O people, go to your Lord. They will be made to stand there\\n   and they will be questioned.  Then it will be said: Bring out a\\n   group (of them) for the Hell-Fire.

            "text": "<p>\\n   Amir ibn Sharahil ash-Sha'bi said: Fatimah bint Qays was among\\n   the first emigrant women. I asked her to narrate to me a hadith\\n   which she had heard directly from Allah's Apostle (peace be upon\\n   him) and there was no extra link between them. She said: Very\\n   well, if you like, I am prepared to do that. He said to her:\\n   Well, do so and narrate it to me. She said: I married the son of\\n   Mughirah and he was a chosen young man of Quraysh at that time,\\n   but he fell as a martyr in the first Jihad (fighting on the side\\n   of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him)). When I became a widow,\\n   AbdurRahman ibn Awf, one of the group of the companions of\\n   Allah's Apostle. sent me a proposal of marriage. Allah's Apostle\\n   (peace be upon him) also sent me such a message for his freed\\n   slave, Usamah ibn Zayd. It had been conveyed to me that Allah's\\n   Apostle (peace be upon him) had said (about Usamah): He who loves\\n   me should also love Usamah.  When Allah's Apostle (peace be upon\\n   him) talked to me (about this matter), I said: My affairs are in\\n   your hands. You may marry me to anyone you wish. He said: You had\\n   better move now to the house of Umm Sharik. Umm Sharik was a rich\\n   lady from among the Ansar. She spent generously for the cause of\\n   Allah and entertained guests very hospitably.  I said: Well, I\\n   shall do as you wish. He said: Do not do that because Umm Sharik\\n   is a woman who is very frequently visited by guests and I do not\\n   like your head to be uncovered or removed from your shank and the\\n   strangers may catch sight of that which you abhor. You had better\\n   move to the house of your cousin, Abdullah ibn Amr ibn Umm\\n   Maktum. He was one of the Banu Fihr branch of the Quraysh, and he\\n   belonged to that tribe (to which Fatimah) belonged. So I moved to\\n   that house, and when my period of waiting was over, I heard the\\n   voice of an announcer making an announcement that the prayer\\n   would be observed in the mosque (where) congregational prayer (is\\n   observed). So I set out towards the mosque and observed prayer\\n   with the Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) and I was in the row\\n   of the women which was near the row of men.  When Allah's Apostle\\n   (peace be upon him) had finished his prayer, he sat on the\\n   pulpit, smiling, and said: Every worshipper should remain sitting\\n   in his place. He then said: Do you know why I have asked you to\\n   assemble?  They said: Allah and His apostle know best. He said:\\n   By Allah, I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a\\n   warning. I have detained you here because Tamim Dari, a Christian\\n   who came and accepted Islam, told me something which agrees with\\n   what I was telling you about the Dajjal. He narrated to me that\\n   he had sailed in a ship with thirty men of Banu Lakhm and Banu\\n   Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month.\\n   Then these (waves) took them (near) the land within the ocean\\n   (island) at the time of sunset. They sat in a small rowing-boat\\n   and landed on that island. There was a beast with long thick hair\\n   (and because of this) they could not distinguish his face from\\n   his back.  They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it\\n   said: I am al-Jassasah.  They said: What is al-Jassasah? It said:\\n   O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very much\\n   eager to know about you.  He (the narrator) said: When it named a\\n   person for us we were afraid of it lest it should be a Devil.\\n   Then we hurried on till we came to that monastery and found a\\n   well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and iron\\n   shackles gripping his legs by the ankles.  We said: Woe to you,\\n   who are you? He said: You soon come to know about me, but tell me\\n   who you are.  We said: We are people from Arabia and we embarked\\n   upon a boat but the waves had been driving us for one month and\\n   they brought us near this island. We took to the rowing-boats and\\n   landed on this island. Here a beast with profusely thick hair met\\n   us and because of the thickness of his hair his face could not be\\n   distinguished from his back. We said: Woe be to thee, who are\\n   you?  It said: I am al- Jassasah.  We said: What is al-Jassasah? \\n   It said: You go to this very person in the monastery for he is\\n   eagerly waiting for you to know about you. So we came to you in\\n   hot haste fearing that that might be the Devil.  He (that chained\\n   person) said: Tell me about the date-palm trees of Baysan.  We\\n   said: In which respect do you seek information about it?  He\\n   said: I ask you whether these trees bear fruit or not. We said:\\n   Yes.  Thereupon he said: I think these will not bear fruit. He\\n   said: Inform me about the lake of Tabariyyah?  We said: What do\\n   you want to know about it?  He said: Is there water in it?  They\\n   said: There is an abundance of water in it. Thereupon he said: I\\n   think it will soon dry up. He again said: Inform me about the\\n   spring of Zughar.  They said: What do you want to know about it? \\n   He (the chained person) said: Is there water in it and does it\\n   irrigate (the land)?  We said to him: Yes, there is an abundance\\n   of water in it and the inhabitants (of Medina) irrigate (land)\\n   with its help. He said: Inform me about the unlettered Prophet;\\n   what has he done?  We said: He has left Mecca and has settled in\\n   Yathrib (Medina).  He said: Do the Arabs fight against him?  We\\n   said: Yes.  He said: How does he deal with him?  We informed him\\n   that he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had\\n   submitted themselves before him. Thereupon he said to us: Had it\\n   actually happened?  We said: Yes. Thereupon he said: If it is so\\n   that is better for them that they show obedience to him. I am\\n   going to tell you about myself. I am the Dajjal and will be soon\\n   permitted to leave. So I shall leave and travel in the land, and\\n   shall not spare any town where I shall not stay for forty nights\\n   except Mecca and Medina: these two (places) are prohibited\\n   (areas) for me and I shall not attempt to enter either of them.\\n   An angel with a sword in his hand will confront me and bar my way\\n   and there will be angels to guard every road leading to it. Then\\n   Allah's apostle (peace be upon him) striking the pulpit with the\\n   help of the end of his staff said: This implies Tayba meaning\\n   Medina. Have I not told you an account (of the Dajjal) like this?\\n   The people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was\\n   liked by me for it corroborates the account which I gave to you\\n   in regard to him (Dajjal) at Medina and Mecca. Behold he (Dajjal)\\n   is in the Syrian sea (Mediterranean) or the Yemen sea (Arabian\\n   sea). Nay, on the contrary, he is in the east, he is in the east,\\n   he is in the east, and he pointed with his hand towards the east.\\n   I (Fatimah bint Qays) said: I preserved it in my mind (this\\n   narration from Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him).\\n  </p>"

As he (the magician)\\n   grew old, he said to the king: I have grown old, send some young\\n   boy to me so that I may teach him magic. He (the king) sent to\\n   him a young man so that he might train him (in magic). On his way\\n   (to the magician) he (the young man) found a monk sitting there.\\n   He (the young man) listened to his (the monk's) talk and was\\n   impressed by it. It became his habit that on his way to the\\n   magician he met the monk set there so he was late in coming to\\n   the magician. He (the magician) beat him because of the delay. He\\n   made a complaint about it to the monk and he said to him: When\\n   you feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my family\\n   detained me. And when you feel afraid of your family you should\\n   say: The magician detained me. It so happened that there came a\\n   huge beast (of prey) and it blocked the way of the people. He\\n   (the young boy) said: I shall find out today whether the magician\\n   or the monk is superior. He picked up a stone and said: O Allah,\\n   if the affairs of the monk are dearer to Thee than the affairs of\\n   the magician, bring death to this animal so that the people will\\n   be able to move about freely. He threw that stone towards it and\\n   killed it and the people began to move about (on the path\\n   freely). He (the young man) then came to that monk and informed\\n   him. The monk said: My son, today you are superior to me. Your\\n   affairs have reached a stage where I find that you will be soon\\n   put to the test, and in case you are put to don't reveal my\\n   identity. That young man began to treat the blind and those\\n   suffering from leprosy and he in fact began to cure people of\\n   (all kinds) of illness. When a companion of the king, who had\\n   become blind heard, about him, he came to him with numerous gifts\\n   and said: If you cure me, all these things collected together\\n   here will be yours. He said: I myself do not cure anyone; it is\\n   Allah Who cures. If you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also\\n   supplicate Allah to cure you. He affirmed his faith in Allah and\\n   Allah cured him. He came to the king and sat by his side as he\\n   used to sit before.  The king said to him: Who restored your\\n   eyesight?  He said: My Lord.  Thereupon he said: It means that\\n   your Lord is One besides me.  He said: My Lord and your Lord is\\n   Allah; so he (the king) took hold of him and tormented him until\\n   he revealed the identity of boy. The young man was thus summoned\\n   and the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that\\n   you have become so proficient in your magic that you cure the\\n   blind and those suffering from leprosy and you do such and such\\n   things. Thereupon he said: I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Who\\n   cures. He (the king) took hold of him and began to torment him.\\n   So he revealed the identity of the monk.  The monk was thus\\n   summoned and it was said to him: You should turn back from your\\n   religion. He, however, refused to do so. He (ordered) a saw to be\\n   brought (and when it was done) he (the king) placed it in the\\n   middle of his head and backed it until it fell apart. Then the\\n   courtier of the king was brought and it was said to him: Turn\\n   back from your religion but he refused to do so. Therefore the\\n   saw was placed in the middle of his head which was backed until\\n   it fell apart. Then young boy was brought and it was said to\\n   him: Turn back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was\\n   handed over to a group of his courtier. He said to them: Take him\\n   to such and such mountain; make him climb that mountain and when\\n   you reach its top (ask him to renounce his faith) but if he\\n   refuses to do so, then throw him (down the mountain). So they\\n   took him and made him climb the mountain and he said: O Allah,\\n   save me from them (in any way) Thou likest. The mountain began to\\n   quake and they all fell down young man came walking back to the\\n   king.  The king said to him: What has happened to your\\n   companions?  He said: Allah has saved me from them.  He again\\n   handed him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry\\n   him away in a small boat and when you reach the middle of the\\n   ocean (ask him to renounce) his religion, but if he does not\\n   renounce his religion throw him (into the water). So they took\\n   him and he said: O Allah, save me from them and what they want to\\n   do. It was not long before the boat overturned and they were\\n   drowned but he came walking back to the king. The king said to\\n   him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has\\n   saved me from them. He also said to the king: You cannot kill me\\n   until you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is that? He\\n   said: You should gather people on a plain and hang me by the\\n   trunk (of a tree). Then take an arrow from the quiver and say: In\\n   the name of Allah, the Lord of the world; then shoot an arrow and\\n   if you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he (the\\n   king) called the people to an open plain and tied him (the boy)\\n   to the trunk of a tree. Then he took an arrow from his quiver\\n   placed the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allah,\\n   the Lord of the young boy; he then shot an arrow and it hit his\\n   temple. He (the boy) placed his hands upon the temple where the\\n   arrow had hit him and he. The people said: We affirm our faith in\\n   the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of\\n   this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young\\n   man.  The courtiers came to the king and it was said to him: Do\\n   you see that their faith is in the Lord?  He (the king) commanded\\n   ditches to be dug at important points in the path. When these\\n   ditches were dug, and the fire was lit in them it was said (to\\n   the people): He who not turn back from his (boy's) religion will\\n   be thrown in the fire or they will be told to jump in it. (The\\n   people courted death but did not renounce religion) till a woman\\n   came with her child and she felt hesitant about jumping into the\\n   fire the child said to her: O mother, endure (this ordeal) for it\\n   is the Truth.\\n  </p>"

            "text": "<p>\\n   We set out on an expedition along with Allah's Apostle (peace be\\n   upon him) until we dismounted in a spacious valley. Allah's\\n   Apostle (peace be upon him) went to relieve himself and I\\n   followed him with a bucket full of water but Allah's Apostle\\n   (peace be upon him) looked about but he found no privacy except\\n   for two trees at the end of the valley. Allah's Apostle (peace be\\n   upon him) went to one of them, took hold of one of its twigs and\\n   said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah; so it\\n   came under his control like the camel who has its nose-string in\\n   the hand of its rider. Then he came to the second tree and took\\n   hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the\\n   permission of Allah; and it came under his control. When he stood\\n   between the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said:\\n   Join with the permission of Allah.  Jabir said: I was afraid lest\\n   Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) should be aware of my\\n   presence and go still farther. Muhammad ibn Abbad used the word\\n   -----and I began to talk to myself. As I looked, I suddenly found\\n   Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) before me and the two trees\\n   were separated, each one of them standing in its place. I saw\\n   Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) standing for a short time,\\n   nodding his head right and left. Isma'il pointed towards the\\n   right and left with the help of his head (in order to\\n   demonstrate) how the Holy Prophet had pointed).  Then he (the\\n   Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir, did you see the place\\n   where I was standing?  I said: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon\\n   him), Yes.  He then said: Then you should go to those two trees\\n   and cut a twig from each of them. Then take then to the place\\n   where I was standing stand there where I was standing and place a\\n   twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out\\n   and took hold of a stone, broke it and sharpened it, then I came\\n   to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then\\n   brought them until I stood at the place where Allah's Apostle\\n   (peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the\\n   right and a twig on the left.  Then I met him and said: Allah's\\n   Apostle (peace be upon him) I have done that, but (kindly)\\n   explain to me the reason for it.  Thereupon he said: I passed by\\n   two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I\\n   liked to make intercession for them so that they might be\\n   relieved of the torment as long as these twigs remain fresh. \\n   Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allah's\\n   Apostle (peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call the people to\\n   perform wudu.  I cried: Come and perform wudu , come and perform\\n   wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allah's Apostle (peace be\\n   upon him) there is not even a drop of water in the army camp.\\n   There was a person who used to cool the water for Allah's Apostle\\n   in the old water-skin which was hung on a branch twig. He asked\\n   me to go to a certain Ansari and ask him to see if there were.\\n   any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but\\n   did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin\\n   and if I were to draw that, the water-skin's dried part would\\n   suck it up.  I came to Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) and\\n   said: Allah's Apostle, I have not found anything in it but a drop\\n   of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw\\n   that, it would be absorbed.  He said: Go and bring that to me. I\\n   brought it to him. He took hold of it, began to utter something\\n   which I could not understand, then pressed it with his hand gave\\n   it to me and said: Jabir, announce the tub to be brought. So I\\n   announced the tub of the army (to be brought). It was brought\\n   accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). \\n   Thereupon Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) placed his hands in\\n   the tub like this, with his fingers outstretched, then he placed\\n   his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it\\n   (the water-skin) and pour water over me by reciting Bismillah. \\n   So I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water out\\n   between the fingers of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him).  Then\\n   that tub gushed forth until it was filled and the Apostle (peace\\n   be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He\\n   who needs water should take it.  Jabir said: The people came and\\n   took water until they were all satisfied.  I said: Is there\\n   anyone left who wants to take it? Allah's Apostle (peace be upon\\n   him) then lifted his hand from that tub and it was still full.\\n   Then the people made a complaint to Allah's Apostle (peace be\\n   upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you with\\n   food! We came to the shore of the ocean; There was a heavy swell\\n   and it cast ashore a big animal we lit, a fire, cooked it and\\n   helped ourselves until we had eaten to our heart's content. \\n   Jabir said: About five people and myself entered its socket and\\n   nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of\\n   one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch. Then we\\n   called the tallest person in the army and the biggest camel of\\n   the army, with the the big saddle on its back, and it could\\n   easily pass through it without the rider needing to bend down.\\n  </p>"
