She states, \"He wiped his head with (the water)\\n    remaining on his hands from his ablution.\" This hadith is\\n    related by Ahmad and Abu Dawud. Abu Dawud's version is,\\n    \"The Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, wiped his\\n    head with the extra water that was in his hand.\" Abu\\n    Hurairah also reported that the Messenger of Allah met\\n    him alone in the streets of Madinah while he was in\\n    post-sex impurity.

Ibn\\n    al-Mundhir said that it is related that 'Ali, Ibn 'Umar,\\n    Abu Umamah, 'Ata, al-Hassan, Makhul and anNakha'i said\\n    that if a person forgot to wipe his head while making\\n    ablution, it is sufficient for him to wipe his head with\\n    any water remaining in his beard. Ibn al-Mundhir stated\\n    that this proves that they took \"used water\" as pure.\\n    This opinion comes from one of the narrations attributed\\n    to Malik and ash-Shaf'i.

It is reported from Ibn\\n    'Abbas that he recited: \"Say (O Muhammad): \"In all that\\n    has been revealed to me, I do not find anything forbidden\\n    to eat; if one wants to eat thereof, unless it be\\n    carrion, or blood poured forth, or swine flesh...\"\\n    (al-An'am 145). Then he said, \"What is forbidden is its\\n    meat. As for its skin, skin used for waterskins, teeth,\\n    bones, fur and wool, they are permissible.\" This is\\n    narrated by Ibn Mundhir and Ibn Hatim. Similarly, its\\n    rennet and milk are considered pure. This is supported by\\n    the fact that when the companions conquered Iraq, they\\n    ate the cheese of the Magians which was made from rennet,\\n    although their slaughtered animals were considered the\\n    same as 'dead animals.' It is confirmed from Salman\\n    al-Farsi that when he was asked about cheese, clarified\\n    butter and pelts, he said, \"What is permissible is what\\n    Allah made permissible in His book. What is forbidden is\\n    what Allah made forbidden in His book.

In fact, Islamic law even\\n    goes to the extent of ordering one to perform ghusl at\\n    this time as part of the overall cleanliness and hygiene\\n    of the Muslim society. Abu Sa'eed reported that the\\n    Prophet said,\"Ghusl on Friday is obligatory (wajib) on\\n    every adult, as is using a toothbrush and applying some\\n    perfume.\" (Related by al-Bukhari and Muslim.)\\n   </p><p>\\n    The meaning of \"obligatory\" here is that it is greatly\\n    recommended. This understanding of the Prophet's saying\\n    is derived from what al-Bukhari recorded about an\\n    incident from Ibn 'Umar about his father. One day, 'Umar\\n    ibn al-Khattab was standing and delivering the khutbah\\n    when 'Uthman, one of the people from among the emigrants\\n    and helpers, entered. 'Umar said to him, \"What time is it\\n    now?\" He said, \"I was busy and could not return home.\\n    When I heard the call to prayer, I did not make more than\\n    the regular ablution.\" 'Umar said, \"And the ablution\\n    only, when you know that the Messenger of Allah ordered\\n    us to perform ghusl ?\" Commenting on the incident, says\\n    ash-Shaf'i, \" 'Uthman did not leave the prayer to perform\\n    ghusl, nor did 'Umar order him to do so. This illustrates\\n    that the companions knew that this order was one of\\n    choice. It also shows that it is preferred.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Muslim recorded that Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet\\n    saying, \"Whoever makes the ablution and perfects it and\\n    then goes to the Friday prayer and listens attentively,\\n    will have forgiveness during (the period) between the\\n    Friday and the next (Friday), and an additional three\\n    days.\" Says al-Qurtubi, \"This hadith shows that ghusl is\\n    preferred. The mention of ablution, the reward and\\n    acceptability points to the fact that ablution alone is\\n    sufficient.'' Ibn Hajr states in at-Talkhis, \"It is one\\n    of the strongest proofs that ghusl for the Friday prayer\\n    is not obligatory. The statement that it is preferred is\\n    built upon the fact that if one does not perform ghusl,\\n    it will not harm (his prayer). But, if others are harmed\\n    by his perspiration or bad smell from his clothes and\\n    body, ghusl becomes obligatory, and not performing it\\n    detracts from the rewards of salah. Some scholars say\\n    that the Friday ghusl is a duty even if its\\n    non-performance causes no harm (to others). Their basis\\n    for this opinion is the hadith related by Abu Hurairah in\\n    which the Prophet, upon whom be peace, said, \"It is a\\n    duty upon every Muslim to perform ghusl once every seven\\n    days, by washing his head and body.\" Al-Bukhari and\\n    Muslim accept the hadith mentioned on the subject in\\n    their apparent meanings, and refute the ones contrary to\\n    the last hadith (of Abu Hurairah).\\n   </p><p>\\n    The time for the Friday ghusl is between dawn and the\\n    time of the Friday prayer. It is preferable to do it at\\n    the time of departure (to the mosque). If one loses his\\n    ablution after that, it is sufficient for him just to\\n    make a new ablution (he does not have to repeat the\\n    ghusl).\\n   </p><p>\\n    Says al-Athram, \"I heard Ahmad being asked if a person\\n    performed ghusl, and then lost it, would the regular\\n    ablution be sufficient for him. He said, 'Yes, and I have\\n    not heard anything about that preferable to the hadith of\\n    Ibn 'Abzi,\" Ahmad is referring to the hadith related by\\n    Ibn 'Abzi Shaibah (with a sahih chain from 'Abdurahman\\n    ibn 'Abzi on the authority of his father, who was a\\n    companion.)He performed ghusl for the Friday prayer, and\\n    afterwards nullified his ablution. After that, he\\n    performed just the regular ablution, and did not repeat\\n    his ghusl. The time for the ghusl ends with the time of\\n    the prayer. If one performs ghusl after the prayer, it\\n    would not be the ghusl of the Friday prayer, and one who\\n    does so is not following the Prophet's order. Ibn 'Umar\\n    reported that the Prophet said, \"Before you come to the\\n    Friday prayer, you should perform ghusl.

Say: 'It is an illness, so let women alone\\n    at such times and go not in unto them until they are\\n    cleaned. And when they have purified themselves, then go\\n    in unto them as Allah has enjoined upon you. Truly, Allah\\n    loves those who turn unto Him and loves those who have a\\n    care for cleanliness\" (al-Baqarah 222). The Messenger of\\n    Allah also said, \"Do everything except intercourse.\"\\n    (Related by \"the group,\" except for al-Bukhari.)\\n   </p><p>\\n    In his comments on the subject, an-Nawawi states, \"If a\\n    Muslim believes it is permissible to have intercourse\\n    with his menstruating wife, he becomes an unbelieving\\n    apostate. If he does it, not thinking that it is\\n    permissible, but out of forgetfulness or not knowing that\\n    it is forbidden or not knowing that his wife was\\n    menstruating, then there is no sin or expiation upon him.\\n    If he does it on purpose, knowing that it is forbidden,\\n    he has committed a grave sin and must repent. There are\\n    two opinions on this: the more correct one is that there\\n    is to be expiation.\" He further says, \"All scholars say\\n    that one may touch anything above the navel or below the\\n    knees. Most scholars say that it is permissible to touch\\n    what is between the navel and the knees, but not the\\n    vagina or anus.\" An-Nawawi concludes that it is permitted\\n    but hated, as that is the strongest position from the\\n    evidence . This evidence is based upon the practice of\\n    the Prophet's wives: when he wished to be with them\\n    during their period, they would put something over their\\n    vagina.

In the first case, the woman knows\\n    that her flow of menstrual blood is lasting longer than\\n    usual. In such a case, she will act according to her\\n    customary period, and the remainder will be considered\\n    days of prolonged blood flows. This is based on the\\n    hadith of Umm Salamah, in which she asked the Messenger\\n    of Allah, upon whom be peace, about this condition. He\\n    said, \"She should wait for the days and nights of her\\n    normal period and figure them out of the month, and she\\n    should leave the prayer during those days. (Afterwards)\\n    she should perform ghusl, tighten something around her\\n    vagina and then pray.\" (Related by Malik, ash-Shafi and\\n    \"the five,\" except for at-Tirmidhi.)\\n   </p><p>\\n    Evaluating the report, an-Nawawi says, \"Its chain meets\\n    the conditions (of al-Bukhari and Muslim).\" Al-Khattabi\\n    holds, \"That regulation is for the woman who is\\n    experiencing prolonged blood flows. If the blood is\\n    flowing, the Prophet ordered her to leave the prayer\\n    during her regular period, and to perform ghusl after her\\n    customary time has passed. Then, she becomes just like\\n    any other purified person.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    In the second case, a woman does not know her period well\\n    enough to determine if she is experiencing menstrual\\n    bleeding or a prolonged flow of blood. In that case, her\\n    menstruation is considered to be six or seven days, which\\n    is the most common among women.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Said Jamnah bint Jahsh, \"I had a very strong prolonged\\n    flow of blood. I went to the Prophet to ask him about it.\\n    When I asked him if I had to stop praying and fasting, he\\n    said 'Tie around a cloth, and it will stop.' I said, 'It\\n    is greater than that.' He said, 'Curb it.' I said, 'It\\n    flows greatly.' He then said, 'You may do one of two\\n    things: either one will suffice. Which one you are able\\n    to do you know best. This is a strike from Satan. Be on\\n    your period for six or seven days, which Allah knows, and\\n    then perform ghusl until you see that you are clean. Pray\\n    for fourteen nights or thirteen nights and days and fast,\\n    and that will be sufficient for you. Do that every month\\n    as the other women become pure and menstruate. If you\\n    can, you may delay the noon prayer and hasten the\\n    afternoon prayer. Perform gh usl and pray the noon and\\n    afternoon prayers together. Then delay the sunset and\\n    hasten the night prayers and pray them together. Perform\\n    ghusl for the morning prayer and pray it. This is how you\\n    may pray and fast if you have the ability to do so...\"\\n    And he said, \"That is the more loved way to me.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    As to the authenticity of the hadith, it is related by\\n    Ahmad, Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi, who grades it as hassan\\n    sahih. He says, \"I asked al-Bukhari about it, and he\\n    called it hassan.\" Ahmad ibn Hanbal says it is hassan\\n    sahih.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Al-Khattabi observes, in a note to this hadith, that this\\n    is for the woman who is a \"beginner\" and does not know\\n    her regular days of menstruation. The Prophet told her to\\n    act according to the customary situation of women, and to\\n    consider herself as having her period only once a month,\\n    like most women. His statement, 'As women menstruate and\\n    as they become pure' points to this fact. This is by\\n    analogy to the affairs of women with respect to each\\n    other in menstruation, pregnancy, maturity and other\\n    affairs of theirs.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    In the third case, a woman has a regular period, but she\\n    is able to distinguish the blood. She should, therefore,\\n    behave according to the type of blood she sees. Fatimah\\n    bint Abu Hubaish had a prolonged flow of blood, and the\\n    Prophet told her, \"If it is menstrual blood, it is dark\\n    and recognizable. If you have that, abstain from the\\n    prayer.

As prayer is the essence of Islam, we will discuss\\n    it here in detail.\\n   </p><p>\\n    To state it simply, prayer must exist, for without it\\n    Islam can not stand. The Prophet, upon whom be peace,\\n    said, \"The head of the matter is Islam, its pillar is the\\n    prayer, and the top of its hump is jihad in the way of\\n    Allah.\" It was the first act of worship that was made\\n    obligatory by Allah. Its obligation was revealed directly\\n    to the Prophet, during his ascension to heaven. Said\\n    Anas, \"The prayers were made obligatory on the Prophet,\\n    upon whom be peace, the night of his ascension to heaven.\\n    At first, they were fifty in number, but were reduced\\n    several times until they were five. Then it was\\n    proclaimed, 'O Muhammad, the order is not changed. These\\n    five are (equivalent) to the fifty.''\\n   </p><p>\\n    As to the authenticity of the report, it is related by\\n    Ahmad, an-Nasa'i and at-Tirmidhi, who said it is sahih.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Salah is the first act that the person will be held\\n    accountable for. 'Abdullah ibn Qart related that the\\n    Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, said \"The first\\n    act that the slave will be accountable for on the Day of\\n    Judgement will be prayer. If it is good, then the rest of\\n    his acts will be good. And if it is evil, then the rest\\n    of his acts will be evil.\" (Related by at-Tabarani.) It\\n    is the last thing that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,\\n    recommended to his nation before he died, saying,\\n    \"Prayer, prayer and what your right hand possesses.\" It\\n    will be the last thing taken away from the religion. When\\n    it perishes, Islam will perish. The Messenger of Allah,\\n    upon whom be peace, said, \"If Islam were stripped away,\\n    piece by piece, people would hold tight to the next one.\\n    The first thing taken would be ruling and governance, and\\n    the last thing would be prayer.\" (Related by Ibn Hibban\\n    from the hadith of Abu Umamah.) In many verses of the\\n    Qur'an, Allah follows up prayer with the remembrance of\\n    Allah. \"Lo! Worship preserves (one) from lewdness and\\n    iniquity, but verily, remembrance of Allah is more\\n    important.\" (al-'Ankabut 45); \"He is successful who grows\\n    and remembers the name of his Lord, so pray (al-A'la\\n    14-15); \"So serve Me and establish worship for My\\n    remembrance\" (Taha 74). Sometimes He mentions prayer\\n    along with zakah: \"Establish prayer and pay zakah\"\\n    (al-Baqarah 110). And at times, with patience: \"Seek help\\n    in patience and prayer\" (al-Baqarah 45), and with hajj:\\n    \"So pray unto your Lord and sacrifice\" (al-Kauthar 2);\\n    \"Say: Lo! my worship and my sacrifice and my living and\\n    my dying are for Allah, Lord of the Worlds. He has no\\n    partner. This am I commanded, and I am the first of those\\n    who surrender (unto Him)\" (al-An'am 162-163). At other\\n    times, Allah begins the acts of piety with prayers and\\n    ends with them, as in the verses about the ma'arij\\n    (ascension to heaven): \"Successful indeed are the\\n    believers who are humble in their prayers,\" and the\\n    verses, \"And who pay heed to their prayers. These are the\\n    heirs who will inherit Paradise. There will they abide\"\\n    (al-Mu'minun 23 : 1 - 11).\\n   </p><p>\\n    The importance of salah is so great that one is ordered\\n    to observe it while travelling or not, while one is safe\\n    or in fear: \"Be guardians of your prayers, and of the\\n    mid-most prayer, and stand up with devotion to Allah. And\\n    if you go in fear, then (pray) standing or on horseback.\\n    When you are safe, remember Allah, as He has taught you\\n    that which (heretofore) you knew not\" (al-Baqarah\\n    238-239).\\n   </p>"

Another narration states,\\n    \"If anyone leaves one of them, by Allah he becomes an\\n    unbeliever and no voluntary deeds or recompense will be\\n    accepted from him, and his blood and wealth become\\n    lawful.\" This is a clear indication that such a person is\\n    to be killed.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ibn 'Umar related that the Messenger of Allah, upon whom\\n    be peace, said, \"I have been ordered to kill the people\\n    until they testify that there is no god except Allah, and\\n    that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and they\\n    establish prayer and pay the zakah.

Whoever hates these (latter) acts will be\\n    innocent of them. Whoever denies them will be safe, but\\n    (not) one who accepts and follows them.\" They asked,\\n    \"Should we kill them?\" He said, \"Not if they pray.\"\\n    (Related by Muslim.) Therefore, he made it unlawful to\\n    kill even an unjust ruler who observes his prayers.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Abu Sa'eed reported that 'Ali, while he was in Yemen,\\n    sent the Prophet some gold, which he then divided among\\n    four people. A man said, \"O Messenger of Allah, beware of\\n    Allah.\" The Prophet said, \"Woe to you. Of all the people\\n    of the earth, am I not the most dutiful in being aware of\\n    Allah?\" Khalid ibn al-Walid said, \"O Messenger of Allah,\\n    shall I kill him?\" He said, \"Perhaps he is one of those\\n    who pray.\" Khalid said, \"How many people say with their\\n    tongues what is not in their hearts?\" The Prophet said,\\n    \"I have not been ordered to look into the hearts of\\n    people, nor to rip open their bellies.\" (Abridged from\\n    al-Bukhari and Muslim.) In this hadith also, prayer is\\n    given as the reason for not killing a person. It is\\n    understood, therefore, that not praying would have\\n    resulted in the person's killing.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Even though the preceding hadith clearly rule that one\\n    who discards salah becomes an unbeliever and should be\\n    killed, many early and later scholars (excluding Abu\\n    Hanifah, Malik and ash-Shafi) believe that such people\\n    become evildoers who must repent. If such a person does\\n    not repent, he is to be killed, that being the prescribed\\n    punishment, according to Malik, ash-Shai'i and others.\\n    Abu Hanifah maintains that such a person is not to be\\n    killed, but must be given a minor punishment and confined\\n    until he prays. They say the hadith that calls such\\n    people unbelievers refer to those who deny the prayers,\\n    and so on. They say that any other interpretation is\\n    contradicted by other texts. For example, Allah says,\\n    \"Lo! Allah does not pardon one who gives Him partners. He\\n    pardons all save whom He wills\" (an-Nisa' 116). There is\\n    also a hadith related by Abu Hurairah and recorded by\\n    Ahmad and Muslim in which the Prophet, upon whom be\\n    peace, said, \"Every prophet has a special supplication\\n    that is answered. Every prophet hastened to make his\\n    supplication, but I concealed mine and will use it for my\\n    nation on the Day of Resurrection. It will be\\n    granted--Allah willing--to whoever dies without\\n    associating any partners with Allah.\" Al-Bukhari also\\n    recorded that Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet,\\n    upon whom be peace, said, \"The person who will be the\\n    happiest due to my intercession is the one who says,\\n    'There is no god but Allah' sincerely from his heart.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Says ash-Shaukani, \"The truth of the matter is that he\\n    becomes an unbeliever who is to be killed for his\\n    unbelief. The hadith authenticates that Islamic law calls\\n    one who does not pray an unbeliever. It has also put the\\n    performance as the barrier between a believer and an\\n    unbeliever. Abandoning prayer means he may be called an\\n    unbeliever. We need not concern ourselves with arguments\\n    presented by those of the opposing opinion. We can say to\\n    them: It is not impossible that some types of unbelievers\\n    may obtain forgiveness or may have a right to\\n    intercession, such as the unbelief of those who pray to (\\n    our) qiblah. Nevertheless, the fact remains that they\\n    commit some sins which the Islamic law views as unbelief.\\n    To turn to the other narrow interpretations is just\\n    redundant.\"\\n   </p>"

Here, we\\n    will mention just two of them, one describing his actions\\n    and other quoting his statements.\\n   </p><p>\\n    'Abdullah ibn Ghanam related that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari\\n    gathered together his people saying, \" O Tribe of\\n    Ash'ari, gather together, and gather your women and\\n    children to teach them how the Messenger of Allah, upon\\n    whom be peace, prayed with us in Madinah.\" They all\\n    gathered to watch him perform ablution. After it, he\\n    waited until the sun had just passed the meridian and\\n    there was some shade, and then he made the adhan. He put\\n    the men in the row closest to him, the children in a row\\n    behind the men, and the women in a row behind the\\n    children. After the iqamah, he raised his hands and made\\n    the takbir, silently recited Surah al-Fatihah and another\\n    surah, repeated the takbir and bowed while saying, \"Glory\\n    be to Allah and Praise be to Him\" three times, after\\n    which he said, \"Allah hears him who praises Him\" and\\n    stood straight. He then made the takbir and prostrated,\\n    made another takbir, raised his head (and sat), repeated\\n    the takbir and prostrated again, after which he said the\\n    final takbir and stood up. In the first rak'ah he made\\n    six takbir, and he made another one when he stood for the\\n    second rak'ah. When he finished the prayer, he turned to\\n    his people and said, \"Guard the number of my takbir and\\n    learn my bowings and prostrations, for this is how the\\n    Prophet prayed with us during this part of the day.\"\\n    (Then he said) when the Prophet, upon whom be peace,\\n    finished the prayer, he turned toward the people and\\n    said, \"O people, listen and understand. Allah has slaves\\n    who are neither prophets nor martyrs, but both the\\n    prophets and martyrs envy them for their closeness to\\n    Allah.\" A bedouin stepped forward, pointed to the\\n    Messenger of Allah and said, \"O Messenger of Allah, tell\\n    us about these people.\" The Prophet was pleased with the\\n    bedouin's request and said, \"They are from various\\n    peoples and tribes who have no ties of relationship\\n    between them. They love each other purely for the sake of\\n    Allah. On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will present\\n    them pulpits of light for them to sit on. Their faces\\n    will be light and their clothes will be light. The people\\n    will be scared on the Day of Resurrection, but they will\\n    not be scared. They are the friends of Allah who will not\\n    have any fear upon them nor will they grieve.\\n   </p><p>\\n    As to the authenticity of this report, it is related by\\n    Ahmad and Abu Ya'la with a hassan chain. Al-Hakim says\\n    its chain is sahih.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Reported Abu Hurairah, \"A man entered the mosque and,\\n    after praying, went to the Prophet, upon whom be peace.\\n    The Prophet, upon whom be peace, responded to his\\n    salutations and said, 'Return and pray, for you have not\\n    prayed.' This happened three times, and the man finally\\n    said, 'By the One who sent you with the Truth, I do not\\n    know any better than that, so teach me.' He said, 'When\\n    you stand for the prayer, make the takbir and then recite\\n    what you can from the Qur'an. Then bow until you attain\\n    calmness and then come up again until you are standing\\n    straight. Then prostrate until you attain calmness in\\n    your sitting, and prostate until you attain calmness in\\n    your prostration. Do that during all of your prayer.\"\\n    (Related by Ahmad, Muslim and al-Bukhari.)\\n   </p><p>\\n    These are general hadith that describe how the Prophet,\\n    upon whom be peace, prayed or what he said about its\\n    performance.

If something of this nature had been confirmed\\n    from the Prophet, the act was probably done just to show\\n    that it is permissible to say only one salaam. Scholars\\n    are agreed that only one salaam is obligatory. If one\\n    makes only one salaam, he should turn to his right for\\n    the first one and to the left for the second one.

We estimated the number of the\\n    glorifications that he made during his bowing to be ten\\n    and in his prostrations also to be ten.\" This is related\\n    by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and an-Nasa'i with a good chain.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Commenting on the subject, ash-Shaukani says, \"Some hold\\n    that this proves that the complete (number of)\\n    glorifications is ten.

There are authentic hadith\\n    that state that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,\\n    elongated his glorifications during prostrations. The\\n    imam may also do so if he knows the followers will not\\n    get tired by making it longer.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Says Ibn 'Abdul-Barr, \"It is a must that every imam\\n    should be easy (by not making the prayers too long) as\\n    has been ordered by the Prophet, even if he knows that\\n    those behind him are strong, because he does not know\\n    what may have happened to them and what needs they may\\n    have to tend to.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ibn al-Mubarak maintains, \"It is preferred for the imam\\n    to make five glorifications. Therefore, all the people\\n    behind him would be able to make (at least) three. It is\\n    preferred that one not limit his remembrance during the\\n    prostrations to just the glorifications, but he should\\n    add some supplications to it. In an authentic hadith, it\\n    is recorded that the Prophet said, 'The closest one of\\n    you comes to his Lord is while he is prostrating,\\n    (therefore) make many supplications therein.' And he also\\n    said, 'I have prohibited you from reciting while bowing\\n    or prostrating.

Then, he would stand\\n    without making the taslim and pray the ninth rak'ah,\\n    after which he would sit, make the tashahud and make the\\n    taslim in such a manner that we could hear him. Then, he\\n    would pray two rak'at after the taslim while sitting, and\\n    that would make eleven rak'at. When he became older and\\n    heavier, he would make the witr with seven rak'at,\\n    performing the (last) two rak'at like the first one. In\\n    another version from her, it is stated: \"When he became\\n    older and bulkier, he would make the witr with seven\\n    rak'at, and he would not sit during them, save in the\\n    sixth and seventh rak'ah and he would not make the\\n    taslim, save in the seventh rak'ah.\" In yet another\\n    version, it is stated: \"He would pray seven rak'at and\\n    would not sit, save in the last of them.\" This is related\\n    by the group.\\n   </p><p>\\n    All of the preceding ahadith are authentic and clear and\\n    there is no contradiction in them.

This is an authentic hadith, and\\n    the statement that he observed witr with seven or five\\n    rak'at is equally true. Both statements confirm each\\n    other. The seven, five, nine, and one rak'ah constitute\\n    the witr prayer, for witr is the name given to the one\\n    rak'ah offered in conclusion of whatever is offered prior\\n    to it. And the witr of the five, seven and nine rak'at\\n    are all connected like the maghrib which is described as\\n    three connected rak'at. If one breaks apart the five or\\n    seven rak'at with two taslim, like in the eleven rak'at,\\n    it will all be called witr due to the last odd rak'ah.\\n    This is supported by the Prophet's statement: 'The night\\n    prayer is sets of two rak'at. If one fears the coming of\\n    the dawn, he should perform one rak'ah, thereby making\\n    all of them odd [witr].' Therefore, the Prophet's actions\\n    and statements are in agreement, each part confirming the\\n    other.\" The fact is that the Prophet was responding to a\\n    question about the night prayer when he said: \"it is in\\n    pairs of two.\" He was not speaking about witr, for the\\n    man had asked him about night prayer, and not about the\\n    witr.\\n   </p>"

Furthermore, the polytheists prostrated with him\\n    and they are impure, and their ablution would not be\\n    acceptable. Al-Bukhari relates from Ibn 'Umar that he\\n    would prostrate even when not free of minor impurities.\\n    Ibn Abi Shaibah recorded the same from him. As for the\\n    report from al-Baihaqi, (with a chain that Ibn Hajar\\n    calls sahih), which says: 'A man is not to prostrate\\n    unless he is in a state of purity.' These reports can be\\n    reconciliated by Ibn Hajar's statement that this (either)\\n    refers to a major defilement or when an option is\\n    available, whereas in the first case it depends on\\n    (presence of defilement and) the need to wash. Similarly,\\n    there is no hadith which states that the clothes or place\\n    need to be pure. Concerning covering the 'aurah and\\n    facing the qiblah if possible, there is no disagreement.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari: \"No one agrees with Ibn\\n    'Umar that one may make the sajdah without being clean of\\n    minor impurities, save ashSha'biy. Ibn Abi Shaibah\\n    related it from him with a sahih chain. He also recorded\\n    from Abu 'Abdurrahman as-Salmi that he would recite an\\n    'ayyah of sajdah and then he would prostrate without\\n    ablution or facing the qiblah and while walking and just\\n    motioning only.

You women are like the companions of\\n    Yusuf.\" This is related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Ibn Hibban,\\n    and at-Tirmidhi who calls it sahih. The fact that the\\n    Prophet insisted that Abu Bakr lead the salah after he\\n    was inforrned that he would be overcome by weeping proves\\n    that it is permissible to cry while praying.\\n   </p><p>\\n    'Umar prayed fajr and recited Surah Yusuf, and when he\\n    reached the verse \"I expose my distress and anguish only\\n    unto Allah,\" he raised his voice in crying. This is\\n    related by al-Bukhari, Sa'id ibn Mansur, and ibn\\n    al-Mundhir. In 'Umar's raising his voice in crying is a\\n    refutation of those who say that crying invalidates the\\n    salah if it causes a sound from the mouth, regardless of\\n    whether it is due to the fear of Allah or not. They argue\\n    that sound from the mouth due to crying is like speaking,\\n    but this is not acceptable as  crying and speaking are\\n    two different things.\\n   </p>"

When he performed ruku', he put her\\n    down, and when he got up from his sajdah, he would place\\n    her back on his neck. 'Amr inquired during which salah\\n    this happened. Ibn Juraij said that it is related from\\n    Zaid ibn Abu 'Atab from 'Amr ibn Salim that this happened\\n    in the morning prayer. This is related by Ahmad,\\n    anNasa'i, and others. Al-Fakihani comments: \"The purpose\\n    behind the action of the Prophet of carrying Umamah in\\n    the salah was to set an example before the Arabs who\\n    considered having daughters and carrying them around as\\n    something bad or shameful. The Prophet sallallahu alehi\\n    wasallam acted differently from them, and carried a girl\\n    on his neck in the prayer, and making something clear by\\n    example is much more effective than a mere precept.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    'Abdullah ibn Shidad relates that his father said: \"The\\n    Messenger of Allah came to us either during the noon or\\n    afternoon prayers and he was carrying Hassan or Hussain.\\n    The Prophet proceeded to the front and put him down and\\n    made the takbir for the salah. During the salah, he made\\n    a long sajdah. I raised my head and saw the child on the\\n    back of the Messenger of Allah while he was in sajdah. I\\n    returned to my sajdah. When the Messenger of Allah\\n    finished the salah, the people said to him: 'O Messenger\\n    of Allah, you prostrated during your salah so long that\\n    we suspected you were thinking about some matter or you\\n    were receiving some revelation.' He said: 'None of that\\n    happened but my son was resting and I hated to rush him\\n    until he had finished what he desired.\"' This is related\\n    by Ahmad, an-Nasa'i, and al-Hakim.\\n   </p><p>\\n    An-Nawawi observes that this, according to the opinion of\\n    ash-Shaf'i and those who agree with him, points to the\\n    permissibility of carrying or holding a young child, male\\n    or female, or any pure animal during an obligatory\\n    prayer, and that it is permissible for both the imam and\\n    the followers. The companions of Malik say that the\\n    permissibility is only for voluntary prayers and not for\\n    obligatory prayers. This interpretation is incorrect as\\n    it is clear that the Prophet was leading one of the\\n    obligatory prayers, and as stated earlier it was the fajr\\n    prayer. Some followers of Malik claim that its\\n    permissibility has been abograted, while others say it\\n    was only permissible for the Prophet, and yet others hold\\n    that it was due to some necessity. All of this is wrong\\n    and to be rejected as there is no proof for any of it or\\n    any necessity. The authentic hadith clearly states that\\n    it is permissible and there is nothing in that ruling\\n    which contradicts any basic principle of the shari'ah as\\n    a human being is pure and what is in his/her abdomen is\\n    not relevant in this regard, as it remains within the\\n    stomach, its natural receptacle. Also, the clothing of a\\n    child is considered pure and the shari'ah is quite\\n    explicit on this point. Actions during the salah do not\\n    invalidate it if they are minor or few or dispersed. The\\n    fact that the Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam did this\\n    is an exposition of its permissibility, and this argument\\n    is built upon the principle which we have mentioned\\n    before. This refutes what Abu Sulaiman al-Khattabi says,\\n    namely, that the Prophet did not carry the child\\n    intentionally but the child was holding onto the Prophet,\\n    and when he stood the child remained with him. He said:\\n    \"Do not think that he held him again intentionally as\\n    that would be too much action and would distract the\\n    heart. If a curtain distracted him, how could [the child]\\n    not distract him?\" This statement by al-Khattabi, may\\n    Allah have mercy on him, is incorrect and to be rejected.\\n    Among the things that refute it are the statements in\\n    Sahih Muslim, \"when he stood, he carried him.\" And, \"when\\n    he got up from his sajdah, he would return [the child to\\n    his place].\" Further refutations are derived from a\\n    version other than Sahih Muslim, \"He came to us while\\n    carrying Umamah and prayed...\" Concerning the ruling\\n    about the curtain, it distracts the heart without there\\n    being any benefit to it. Concerning carrying Umamah, we\\n    are not convinced that it distracts the heart, and even\\n    if it does, it is allowed due to its benefit and the\\n    principles that we have mentioned. The source of that\\n    preoccupation is that benefit, which differs from the\\n    incident concerning the curtain. Thus, the correct\\n    position is that the hadith is a clear exposition that it\\n    is permissible to carry a child in salah and this will\\n    continue to be part of the Islamic law until the Day of\\n    Judgment. And Allah knows best.\\n   </p>"

He\\n    writes:\\n   </p><p>\\n    The Prophet would pray and 'Aishah would be lying between\\n    him and the qiblah. When he performed sajdah, he would\\n    signal to her with his hand and she would pull back her\\n    leg and when he would stand she would stretch out her leg\\n    again. The Prophet was praying and the Satan came to him\\n    to disturb his salah and the Prophet choked until his\\n    saliva came upon his hand. And the Prophet would pray\\n    upon the pulpit, making ruku' there, but when the time\\n    came to perform sajdah, he would descend, moving\\n    backward, and prostrate upon the ground, and then return\\n    to the pulpit. He once prayed toward a wall and an animal\\n    tried to pass between him and the wall. The Prophet\\n    prevented the animal from passing to the extent that its\\n    stomach was against the wall. Once while he was praying,\\n    two girls from the tribe of 'Abd al-Muttalib were\\n    fighting behind him and he separated them with his arms\\n    while he was praying. Ahmad's version says that they\\n    grabbed unto his knees and he separated them without\\n    leaving the salah. On another occasion, when he was\\n    praying, a boy came to him and he motioned to him to move\\n    back, and he moved back. Then a girl tried to pass in\\n    front of him, he beckoned her to move back, but the girl\\n    passed, and when he finished, he said: \"They are more\\n    determined.\" Ahmad recorded it and it is also in the\\n    Sunan. He would also puff out air while praying. The\\n    hadith which states: \" Puffing out is speech\" cannot be\\n    traced to the Messenger of Allah, but Sa'id related it in\\n    his Sunan from Ibn 'Abbas as one of Ibn 'Abbas'\\n    statements - if it is authentic. The Prophet would cry\\n    during his salah and would also clear his throat while\\n    praying. 'Ali ibn Abi Talib said: \"I had a certain time\\n    at which I would visit the Messenger of Allah. When I\\n    came to him, he would permit me to enter. If I found him\\n    praying, he would clear his throat and I would enter. If\\n    he was free, he would give me permission to enter.\" This\\n    is recorded by an-Nasa'i and Ahmad. Ahmad's version says:\\n    \"I could enter upon the Prophet during the day or night.\\n    If I came to him while he was praying, he would clear his\\n    throat [as a sign that I may enter]. This was related by\\n    Ahmad who used to act by it and he was not of the opinion\\n    that clearing one's throat invalidated the salah.\\n    Sometimes the Prophet would pray barefoot and sometimes\\n    while wearing shoes. This is what 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar\\n    said and he ordered people to pray with shoes on in order\\n    to differ from the Jews. Sometimes he would pray in one\\n    garment and sometimes in two garments and [this latter]\\n    was the majority of the cases.\\n   </p>"

The following is a summary of what he says\\n    on this subject:\\n   </p><p>\\n    Concerning one who leaves a salah intentionally until its\\n    time expires, he will never be able to make up for that\\n    salah. Such a person should turn to Allah and ask His\\n    forgivness and increase his good deeds and nawafil in\\n    order to increase his weight [of good] on the Day of\\n    Resurrection. Abu Hanifah, Malik, and ash-Shaf'i say that\\n    he can make up the prayer after its time has expired, and\\n    Malik and Abu Hanifa even say that if a person\\n    intentionally misses a prayer or a few prayers, then he\\n    is to make up those prayers before he prays the present\\n    salah, even if he has missed all five prayers and should,\\n    while making them up, miss the present salah. They say\\n    that if he missed more than five prayers, he is to begin\\n    by praying the salah whose time is present [and then he\\n    is to make up the prayers he missed]. The proof for our\\n    position [i.e, the position of Ibn Hazm] is found in the\\n    words of Allah, the Exalted: \"Woe unto the worshippers\\n    who are heedless of their prayers,'' and: \"And then there\\n    succeeded them a later generation who wasted the prayers\\n    and followed their own lusts, but they will meet with\\n    destruction.\" If one who intentionally misses a salah\\n    could make it up later, then why is it mentioned with\\n    affliction or transgression? Of course, there is no\\n    affliction or transgression on one who delays the salah.\\n    But the case of one who procrastinates until the last\\n    portion of its permissible time expires is quite\\n    different. Allah, the Exalted, has appointed certain\\n    times for the fard salah; both the beginning time and the\\n    ending time for the salah have been established, and\\n    there is no difference between praying a salah before its\\n    time and praying it after its proper time elapses\\n    because, in both cases the salah is not performed within\\n    its prescribed time. This is not to draw an analogy\\n    between one and the other but it is applying the same\\n    rule to them as they both must be performed within the\\n    limits set by Allah. Allah, the Exalted, says: \"Whoever\\n    transgresses the limits set by Allah has verily wronged\\n    his own soul!\" \\n   </p>"

Legislating [in shari'ah] is not permissible, save by Allah's authority as evidenced by His Prophet. We ask those people who say that one may make qada' for a salah which he misses intentionally: 'Tell us about this salah that you want him to perfom, is it the same salah that Allah ordered him to perform or is it a different one?' If they say it is the same one, then we may say to them: 'Then one who misses it intentionally is not guilty of being disobedient [to Allah, the Exalted], as he has done what Allah had ordered him to do, and there is no sin upon him according to your statement and likewise there should be no blame upon one who intentionally delays a salah until its time expires, but that is not an acceptable position for any Muslim.' If they say that it is not the salah which Allah ordered, we may say: 'You have told the truth,' and this is a sufficient confession from them. Then, we may ask them: 'Is one who intentionally leaves the salah until its time expires being obedient or disobedient to Allah?' If they say obedient, they will be differing from the consensus of the Muslims and the Qur'an and the confirmed sunnah. If they say he is being disobedient, they are speaking the truth and it is not valid that an act of disobedience should replace an act of obedience. Also, Allah, the Exalted, has set specific limits, through the tongue of His Messenger, for the times of the salah. Each salah has a specific beginning time, and no one may perform the salah before that time, and each prayer has a specific ending time, and no one may perform the salah after that time. No one of this ummah will dispute that point. However, if one is allowed to pray after the time set by the Messenger of Allah, then setting an ending time for the salah has no meaning to it. Such an opinion is nonsense and may Allah, the Exalted, keep us from it. Every action is connected with a certain time and it is not valid outside of that time; if it was valid outside of that time, what would be the purpose of that time being specifically singled out for that act? [The logic of this argument] is clear and Allah, the Almighty, is our Supporter.",

It has been\\n    authentically reported that the Prophet said: \"Whoever\\n    misses the 'asr salah, it is as if he has lost his family\\n    and his property.\" It is correct to say that if one\\n    \"misses\" something, he cannot make it up, for if he makes\\n    it up or could make it up, the act would not be \"missed.\"\\n    The entire Muslim ummah is in agreement with the\\n    statement and ruling that if the time of the salah has\\n    elapsed, then the salah is \"over\" [i.e., \"qada\" in\\n    Arabic], but if one can make it up, the statement that\\n    the salah is \"over\" becomes false and untrue; therefore,\\n    there is no way that it could ever be made up. The people\\n    who agree with us on this include 'Umar ibn al-Khattab,\\n    his son 'Abdullah, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqas, Salman al-Farsi,\\n    ibn Mas'ud, al-Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, Budail\\n    al-'Uqaili, Muhammad ibn Sireen, Mutraf ibn 'Abdullah,\\n    'Umar ibn 'Abdulaziz, and others. Allah has left no\\n    excuse, for anyone required to perform the salah, to\\n    delay the salah from its proper time for any reason\\n    whatsoever, not even during times of fighting, fear,\\n    extreme illness, or travelling. Allah says: \"And when you\\n    are among them and arrange them for salah, let only one\\n    party be with you\" And: \"But if you are in danger, then\\n    walking or riding.\" Allah, the Exalted, does not permit\\n    even the extremely sick person to delay the salah. In\\n    fact, such a person has been ordered to pray sitting, if\\n    he cannot pray standing, and if he cannot pray sitting,\\n    then he may pray on his side. Also, if one cannot make\\n    ablution with water, he may make tayammum; and if he\\n    cannot find soil to make tayammum, he may still pray.\\n    Whence has the permission been obtained that one may\\n    intentionally leave the salah until its time is finished\\n    and who has ordered that it be performed after its time\\n    and how is it that the belated salah would be sufficient?\\n    None of this is derived from the Qur'an, Sunnah, Qiyas\\n    (analogical reasoning), and so forth.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ibn Hazm further says: \"Concerning our statement that the\\n    one who intentionally leaves a salah until its time\\n    expires is to repent to Allah, the Exalted, ask for His\\n    forgiveness, pray an increased number of nawafil, and do\\n    good deeds. This statement is based on Allah's words:\\n    \"Then there succeeded them a generation who missed\\n    prayers and followed after lusts. But they will meet\\n    destruction save him who repents and believes and does\\n    right. Such will enter the garden and will not be\\n    wronged,\" and: \"...those who, when they do an evil thing\\n    or wrong themselves, remember Allah and implore\\n    forgiveness for their sins - who forgives sins, save\\n    Allah - and will not knowingly repeat the wrong they\\n    did,\" and: \"Whoever does an atom's weight of good shall\\n    see it and whoever does an atom's weight of evil shall\\n    see it,\" and: \"...We set a just balance for the day of\\n    resurrection so no soul shall be wronged.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    This [Muslim] ummah is in agreement, and there are texts\\n    that state that voluntary acts are a type of good deeds\\n    and Allah knows how much they are really worth. It\\n    necessarily follows that a number of voluntary works may\\n    be equivalent in merit to an obligatory deed and may even\\n    amount to a greater merit. Furthermore, Allah has\\n    informed us that He does not waste the action of any\\n    person and that the good deeds erase the evil ones.\\n   </p>"

There is nothing in the sunnah which confines this\\n    general term to any particular meaning. Ibn al-Mundhir\\n    and others have mentioned more than twenty reports on\\n    this point. Here we shall mention some of the more\\n    important reports.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ahmad, Muslim, Abu Dawud, and al-Baihaqi record that\\n    Yahya ibn Yazid said: \"I asked Anas ibn Malik about\\n    shortening the prayer, and he said: 'The Messenger of\\n    Allah would pray two rak'at if he had traveled a distance\\n    of three miles or farsakh.\"' Ibn Hajar writes in Fath\\n    al-Bari: \"This is the most authentic hadith which states\\n    and clarifies [that question].\" The conflict between mile\\n    and farsakh is made clear in Abu Sa'id al-Khudri's\\n    statement: \"If the Prophet traveled a distance of one\\n    farsakh, he would shorten his prayer.\" This was related\\n    by Sa'id ibn Mansur in his Sunan and by al-Hafiz ibn\\n    Hajar in at-Talkhis, and he implicitly accepted it by not\\n    making any further comments about it. It is well-known\\n    that a farsakh equals three miles and, therefore, Abu\\n    Sa'id's hadith removes the confusion which arises from\\n    Anas' hadith when he says that the shortest distance, due\\n    to which the Prophet shortened his prayer, was three\\n    miles. One farsakh is equivalent to 5,541 meters while\\n    one mile equals 1,748 meters. The shortest distance which\\n    has been mentioned with respect to the shortening of\\n    salah is one mile. This was recorded by Ibn abi Shaibah,\\n    with a sahih chain, on the authority of Ibn 'Umar. Ibn\\n    Hazm follows this report, and argues that if the distance\\n    is less than one mile, one is not to shorten the salah,\\n    the Messenger of Allah went to the graveyard of al-Baqi'\\n    to bury the dead and (similarly) he went off to answer\\n    the call of nature and did not shorten his salah.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Concerning what some jurists say, namely, that the\\n    journey must be at least two days long or as some say\\n    three days, Imam Abu al-Qasim alKharqi's refutation of\\n    their opinion is sufficient for us. In al-Mughni he says:\\n     'I do not find any proof for what those scholars say.\\n    The statements of the (sahabah) companions are\\n    contradictory, and they are not a (conclusive) proof if\\n    they differ. Something has been related from Ibn 'Umar\\n    and Ibn 'Abbas which differs from what these scholars use\\n    as proof. Even if that were not the case, their\\n    statements do not constitute a proof when a statement or\\n    action of the Prophet himself exists. Even if their\\n    statements were accepted, we would not be able to follow\\n    the distance they mentioned due to the following two\\n    reasons. One, they differ from the sunnah that has been\\n    related from the Prophet and from the clear meaning of\\n    the Qur'an, as the clear meaning of the verse allows one\\n    to shorten one's salah if one makes any journey upon the\\n    earth. Allah says: \"If you journey on the earth, there is\\n    no blame upon you if you shorten your prayer.\" The\\n    condition of there being fear has been deleted as can be\\n    seen in the hadith we recorded from Ya'la ibn Umayyah,\\n    and what remains is the clear meaning of the verse which\\n    covers every type of journey. The Prophet said: \"The\\n    traveler may wipe over his socks for a period of three\\n    days.\" This shows the length of time that one may wipe\\n    over the socks and it cannot be used as a proof for the\\n    question we are discussing here. One could argue that\\n    traveling is less than a three-day journey on the basis\\n    of the hadith: \"It is not allowed for any woman who\\n    believes in Allah and the last day to travel a journey of\\n    one day, save in the presence of a male relative.\" Two,\\n    the question of the distance to be traveled is one that\\n    may only be answered by some sort of revelation from\\n    Allah, the Exalted [the Qur' an or Sunnah]; it is not the\\n    type of issue which one may address on the basis of\\n    personal reasoning, nor is there any way to derive an\\n    analogy. The proofs which exist support the opinion that\\n    shortening the salah is permissible for every traveler,\\n    unless there is some consensus to the contrary.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Similar to that is the traveling by planes, trains, and\\n    so forth, or a trip that is in obedience to Allah, the\\n    Exalted, or otherwise. If there is someone whose\\n    occupation requires him to always be traveling, for\\n    instance, a pilot, a ship captain, truck driver, and so\\n    on, then he is permitted to shorten his salah or break\\n    his fast as he is truly traveling.\\n   </p>"

If the person\\n    intends to stay in a place for a certain amount of time\\n    then, according to Ibn al-Qayyim, he remains a traveler,\\n    regardless of whether he plans to stay there for a long\\n    or short time, as long as he does not plan to stay [i.e.,\\n    reside and not return] in the place that he has traveled\\n    to. The scholars differ on this point. Summing up and\\n    giving his own opinion, Ibn al-Qayyim says: \"The\\n    Messenger of Allah stayed in Tabuk for twenty days and\\n    during that time he shortened his salah and he did not\\n    say that one may not shorten his salah if he stays longer\\n    than that, although there is agreement that he did stay\\n    there for that period of time.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    In Sahih al-Bukhari, it is recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said:\\n    \"The Prophet stayed, during some of his journeys, for\\n    nineteen day and he prayed only two rak'at. If we stayed\\n    in a place for nineteen days, we would not pray the\\n    complete salah. However, if we stayed longer than that,\\n    we would perform the whole salah.\" Ahmad states that ibn\\n    'Abbas was referring to the Prophet's stay in Makkah at\\n    the time of its conquest when he said: \"The Messenger of\\n    Allah stayed in Makkah for eighteen days during the time\\n    of the conquest as he had to go to Hunain and was not\\n    planning to stay there.\" This is his interpretation of\\n    Ibn 'Abbas' statement. Others say that Ibn 'Abbas was\\n    referring to the Prophet's stay in Tabuk as Jabir ibn\\n    'Abdullah said: \"The Messenger of Allah stayed in Tabuk\\n    for twenty days and performed qasr salah.\" Imam Ahmad\\n    related this in his Musnad. Al-Miswar ibn Makhramah\\n    reports: \"We stayed with Sa'd in some of the cities of\\n    ash-Sham [Syria] for forty days, and Sa'd would perform\\n    qasr while we would offer the whole salah.\" Naf'i\\n    relates: \"Ibn 'Umar was in Azerbaijan for six months, as\\n    there was snow blocking the pass, and he would pray two\\n    rak'at.\" Hafs ibn 'Ubaidullah says: \"Anas ibn Malik\\n    stayed in ash-Sham for two years and he prayed the salah\\n    of a traveler.\" Anas relates: \"The companions of the\\n    Prophet stayed in Ram Hurmuz for seven months and they\\n    shortened their salah.\" Al-Hassan reports: \"I stayed with\\n    'Abdurrahman ibn Samurah for two years in Kabul, and he\\n    shortened his salah but he did not combine the salah.\"\\n    Ibrahim says: \"We resided in Rai for a year or more and\\n    in Sijistan for two years . . . [and we prayed qasr].\\n    This is the guidance of the Prophet and his companions,\\n    and this is the correct position.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Concerning other opinions which people follow Imam Ahmad\\n    say: \"If a person intends to stay for four days, he has\\n    to offer the whole salah and he may offer qasr if his\\n    intention is for less than that. This is based on an\\n    interpretation of the reports from the Prophet and his\\n    companions [i.e., they never intended to stay for longer\\n    than that and would always say: 'We will leave tomorrow,'\\n    and so on]. This interpretation is obviously suspect. The\\n    Prophet conquered Makkah and stayed there to establish\\n    Islam, eradicate polytheism, and to guide the Arabs. It\\n    definitely goes, without saying, that such an objective\\n    does take more than a day or two to complete. Similarly,\\n    his stay in Tabuk was in preparation for the impending\\n    war and he knew that this might take longer than just\\n    four days. In the same way, Ibn 'Umar's stay in\\n    Azerbaijan for six months, and his praying qasr during\\n    the entire time was with the knowledge that it takes more\\n    than two or three days for such snow to melt and the pass\\n    to become traversable. The same is the case with Anas'\\n    stay of two years in ash-Sham and his praying qasr and\\n    the companions' stay in Ram Hurmuz for seven months while\\n    shortening their prayers. It is well known that\\n    activities like theirs, such as jihad and guarding, took\\n    more than four days.\" The followers of Ahmad maintain:\\n    \"If one is staying in a place for the purpose of jihad or\\n    due to imprisonment or sickness, then one may shorten\\n    one's salah regardless of whether the person thinks that\\n    such a situation may last for a short time or a long\\n    time.\" This is correct but there is no proof that such\\n    conditions have been stipulated in the Qur'an, Sunnah,\\n    ijma' (consensus), or practice of the Prophet's\\n    companions. They argued that such conditions are based on\\n    what is needed for the person to fulfill his need while\\n    remaining a traveler, and that is what is less than four\\n    days. His response to them was: 'From where do you derive\\n    those conditions, while the Prophet sallallahu alehi\\n    wasallam stayed for more than four days, shortening his\\n    salah, in Makkah and Tabuk, and he did not mention to\\n    anyone anything about it and he never told them that he\\n    never intended to stay for more than four days, even\\n    though he knew that the people would [strictly] follow\\n    his actions concerning the salah. They surely followed\\n    him in his shortening of the salah, and he did not object\\n    to their praying qasr if they were to stay for more than\\n    four nights. This should be made clear as it is very\\n    important. Similarly, the companions (as-sahabah)\\n    followed him in that and he did not say anything [in\\n    objection] to those who prayed with him.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik and ash-Shaf'i say: \"If one intends to stay for\\n    more than four days, he should perform the whole salah,\\n    and if he intends to stay for less than that, he is to\\n    offer qasr.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Abu Hanifah holds: \"If one intends to stay for fifteen\\n    days, he should do the qasr. If he intends to stay for\\n    less than that, he should not shorten the salah.\" This is\\n    also the opinion of al-Laith ibn Sa'd, and it has also\\n    been related from three companions: 'Umar, ibn 'Umar, and\\n    Ibn 'Abbas.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab is of the opinion that: \"If you\\n    stay for four days, you pray four rak'at.\" A statement\\n    similar to that of Abu Hanifah's has also been related\\n    from him. 'Ali ibn Abi Talib says that if one stays for\\n    ten days, he is to perform the whole salah, and the same\\n    has been related from Ibn ' Abbas .\\n   </p><p>\\n    Al-Hassan says: \"One who does not get to his destination\\n    or (city of residence) may shorten salah.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    'Aishah says: \"One who does not put down his provision is\\n    to shorten the salah.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    The four imams agree that if one has some need to take\\n    care of and always has the intention of leaving the next\\n    day, then he may shorten his salah for as long as he is\\n    in that state. However, according to one statement of\\n    ash-Shaf'i, he may do so only for seventeen or eighteen\\n    days and he is not to shorten his salah after that time.\\n    Ibn al-Mundhir states in his Ishraf: \"The people of\\n    knowledge are in agreement that a traveler may perform\\n    qasr as long as he does not intend to stay in a place,\\n    even though he stays there for years.\"\\n   </p>"

                "text": "<p>\\n    Some of the conditions under which the jumu'ah salah\\n    becomes obligatory have already been mentioned (i.e., it\\n    is obligatory for a free, sane, adult male resident who\\n    does not have a valid excuse which would excuse him from\\n    attending the prayer). It was also mentioned that a\\n    congregation is a condition for the Friday salah. This is\\n    what the sunnah of the Prophet teaches us and what Allah\\n    holds us responsible for. Concerning the other\\n    stipulations which some of the jurists stipulate for the\\n    Jumu'ah salah, none of them has any basis to which we may\\n    refer, or any evidence to support it. It will be\\n    sufficient here to simply quote the author of ar-Raudah\\n    anNadiyah who writes:\\n   </p><p>\\n    [The Friday salah] is like the rest of the prayers and\\n    there is nothing in it that differs from them, unless\\n    there is some evidence to the contrary. This statement\\n    refutes those who stipulate, as a necessary conditions\\n    for Friday prayer, the presence of a well-established\\n    imam and a congregational mosque in the area as well as a\\n    certain number of people attending the congregational\\n    prayer. There is no evidence whatever that those\\n    conditions are even preferred - not to speak of being\\n    obligatory, or for that matter, being a necessary\\n    condition for the Friday salah. If two people pray the\\n    Jumu'ah in a place where there is no one else but them,\\n    they would have performed their prescribed duty. If one\\n    of them delivers the khutbah, they would be following\\n    what is sunnah; and if they leave the khutbah, then it is\\n    only the sunnah which they have neglected, (not something\\n    which was obligatory). But for the hadith of Tariq ibn\\n    Shihab which clearly requires every Muslim to offer it in\\n    congregation and the fact that the Prophet sallallahu\\n    alehi wasallam always performed it in a congregation,\\n    offering it individually, like the rest of the prayers,\\n    would have been quite acceptable. Concerning the\\n    statement \"from four people to the ruler of the area,\"\\n    that is certainly not the Prophet's statement nor of any\\n    of his companions... In fact, [this is] a statement of\\n    al-Hassan al-Basri. As to various statements and\\n    psuedojuristic opinions concerning this noble worship,\\n    the Friday prayer, which Allah has prescribed once a week\\n    as one of the signs of Islam, a little consideration\\n    should suffice to show their superfluity and error. One\\n    of these is the amazing statement that khutbah is\\n    equivalent to two rak'at of salah, and if one misses it,\\n    then his jumu'ah is not valid. They seem to be quite\\n    ignorant of what has been related from the Prophet\\n    through a number of chains which support each other that\\n    \"if a person misses one rak'ah, then he is to perform\\n    another rak'ah and his salah would be completed.\" Have\\n    not other ahadith reached them that are valid in such\\n    matters? Some say that one cannot perform the Jumu'ah\\n    unless there are three people with the imam and others\\n    hold that four people are needed, while yet others\\n    stipulate seven people! Still others say nine, and some\\n    think twelve, twenty, thirty, and there are even some who\\n    think forty, fifty, seventy, and every number that is\\n    between those numbers! Some hold that many people have to\\n    be present without specifying a particular number, while\\n    others state that al-Jumu'ah may only be performed in a\\n    city in which there is a \"congregational mosque.\" Some\\n    are convinced that there have to be so many thousand\\n    people living in the area. Some hold that there has to be\\n    a congregational mosque and a public restroom. Yet others\\n    propose that the prayer is not obligatory unless there is\\n    a well-known and established imam; if such an imam cannot\\n    be found or if his credibility is doubtful, then the\\n    Friday salah is neither obligatory nor legitimate....No\\n    such statement can be found [in the book of Allah or in\\n    the sunnah] to support what they claim to be the\\n    conditions or prerequisites of the Jumu'ah... Whoever\\n    comes with such gibberish must be refuted for the only\\n    criterion is the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His\\n    Messenger. As Allah says in the Qur'an: \"If you dispute\\n    concerning any matter, refer it to Allah and the\\n    Messenger\"; \"The answer of the believers, when summoned\\n    to Allah and His Messenger, in order that he may judge\\n    between them is no other than this: they say: \"We hear\\n    and we obey\"; \"But no, by thy Lord, they can have no\\n    (real) faith, until they make thee judge in all disputes\\n    between them, and find in their souls no resistance\\n    against thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest\\n    conviction.\" Those verses and others similar to them are\\n    the clearest evidence that one must return to the rule of\\n    Allah and His Messenger if there is any dispute. The rule\\n    of Allah is the Book of Allah. The rule of the Messenger,\\n    after his passing away, is his sunnah and nothing other\\n    than that. Also, Allah did not endow any of his slaves -\\n    even if he reaches the highest degree of knowledge and\\n    has accumulated what no one else has - with the right to\\n    make any statement concerning this religion without any\\n    authority from the Book or the Sunnah. Likewise, if a\\n    mujtahid (jurisconsult) should take liberty of proposing\\n    an opinion without substantiating it, then it is not\\n    permissible for anyone to follow him in that, regardless\\n    of who he may be. I, as Allah knows, am always greatly\\n    astonished by this type of writers and their writings\\n    which supposedly provide guidance in one's creed and\\n    practice but which are filled with gibberish. This is not\\n    limited to only some of the schools among the different\\n    schools of law, or only certain areas from among the\\n    different areas, or only certain eras from among all of\\n    the eras [it is found in all of these schools of law,\\n    areas, and eras]! In fact, the later people follow the\\n    earlier people [in such things] as if they were following\\n    the umm al-kitab [mother of the Book], although, [they\\n    follow] distorted teachings.\\n   </p>"

During the Prophet's time, there was only one\\n    adhan and that was made when the Prophet sat upon the\\n    pulpit. Bilal would make the adhan and then the Prophet\\n    would give the two khutbahs. Next, Bilal would make the\\n    iqamah and the Prophet would lead the people in salah. It\\n    is not possible that the Prophet would have made a salah\\n    after the adhan nor anyone else among the Muslims who\\n    prayed with the Prophet could have done so. And we have\\n    no evidence to show that the Prophet, sallallahu alehi\\n    wasallam, prayed in his house before going out to the\\n    mosque on Friday. He did not specify any time for any\\n    salah before the Friday salah. What he said was meant to\\n    exhort those going early to the mosque on Friday to\\n    engage themselves in prayer. He said: 'Whoever goes out\\n    early and walks and does not ride to the mosque and prays\\n    what has been prescribed [by Allah] for him...' That has\\n    been related from the Prophet's companions. When they\\n    would reach the mosque on Friday, they would pray\\n    whatever amount was easy for them. Some of them prayed\\n    ten rak'at and some prayed twelve and some only eight and\\n    others less than that. For this reason most of the\\n    scholars are of the opinion that there is no sunnah\\n    prayer with a specified number of rak'ah or time, before\\n    aljumu'ah, for there is nothing either in the actions or\\n    statements of the Prophet to support or confirm it.\\n   </p>"

                "text": "<p>\\n    Zakah or alms tax can be defined as that portion of a\\n    man's wealth which is designated for the poor. The term\\n    is derived from the Arabic verbal root meaning \"to\\n    increase.\" \"to purify,\" and \"to bless.\" It find its\\n    origin in Allah's command to: \"Take sadaqah (charity)\\n    from their property in order to purify and sanctify them\"\\n    [at-Taubah 103]. That is why this kind of sadaqah is\\n    called zakah, for by paying it, one is aspiring to attain\\n    blessing, purification, and the cultivation of good\\n    deeds.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Taking into account its very nature, it is no wonder that\\n    zakah constitutes one of the five pillars of Islam. It is\\n    associated with prayer (salah) in eighty-two Qur'anic\\n    verses. Allah, the Exalted One, prescribed it in His Book\\n    (The Qur'an), His Messenger corroborated it by his\\n    (sunnah), and the community (ummah) by consensus  upheld\\n    it. Ibn 'Abbas reported that when the Prophet, upon whom\\n    be peace, sent Mu'adh ibn Jabal to Yemen (as its\\n    governor), he said to him: \"You are going to a people who\\n    are People of the Scripture. Invite them to accept the\\n    shahadah: that there is no god but Allah and I am His\\n    Messenger. If they accept and affirm this, tell them that\\n    Allah, the Glorious One, has enjoined five prayers upon\\n    them during the day and night. If they accept that, tell\\n    them also that He has enjoined sadaqah upon their assets\\n    which will be taken from the rich of the (Muslim)\\n    community and distributed to the poor. If they accept\\n    that, refrain from laying hands upon the best of their\\n    goods and fear the cry of the oppressed, for there is no\\n    barrier between Allah and it.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    At-Tabarani relates in al-'Awsat and as-Saghir, on the\\n    authority of 'Ali, that the Prophet said: \"Allah has\\n    enjoined upon rich Muslims a due to be taken from their\\n    properties corresponding to the needs of the poor among\\n    them. The poor will never suffer from starvation or lack\\n    of clothes unless the rich neglect their due. If they do,\\n    Allah will surely hold them accountable and punish them\\n    severely.\" According to at-Tabarani: \"It was reported\\n    only by Thabit ibn Muhammad az-Zahid.\" Of Thabit's\\n    credibility, al-Hafiz in turn says: \"Thabit was an honest\\n    and trustworthy person. AlBukhari and others related from\\n    him, and the rest of the narrators in the chain are\\n    considered as accepted authorities.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    In the early days of Islam at Makkah, no limit or\\n    restriction was placed on the amount to be donated, for\\n    that decision was left to the individual Muslim's\\n    conscience and generosity. In the second year of hijrah,\\n    according to the widely known authorities, both the type\\n    and the quantity of zakah revenues were determined, and\\n    detailed illustrations were provided.\\n   </p>"

Their rationale is that since\\n    merchandise is a form of cash, there is no difference\\n    between it and dinars or dirhams in terms of which it is\\n    valued. This means that the form of the nisab can\\n    alternate between value in the form of cash and that\\n    which is valued in the form of merchandise. If zakah had\\n    not been obligatory on merchandise, the rich--or most of\\n    them --would have converted their cash into merchandise\\n    for trading purposes, making sure that the nisab of gold\\n    and silver is never possessed by them for a year.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    The main consideration here is that by levying zakah on\\n    the rich, Allah the Exalted wants to help the poor and to\\n    promote the welfare of the people in general.

Zakah thus\\n    eliminates the causes of corruption which results from\\n    the increase of money in a few hands. It is this wisdom\\n    which the Qur'an refers to when it deals with the\\n    distribution of booty: \"... that it becomes not a\\n    commodity between the rich among you\" (al Hashr 7).\\n    Therefore, it is not reasonable to exempt businessmen\\n    from their societal obligations when they possess most of\\n    the nation's wealth.\\n   </p>"

[The crux of the issue is]: What qualifies the four\\n    edible items [wheat, barley, dates, and dried grapes] for\\n    zakah? Are they subject to zakah because of their being\\n    delineated as such or because of their special import to\\n    the subsistence of life? Those who subscribe to the first\\n    view restrict payment of zakah to the four edibles, and\\n    those who subscribe to the second view extend the\\n    obligation to all land produce except for grass,\\n    firewood, and bamboo. There is a consensus on the latter\\n    being excluded from zakah. However, when it comes to the\\n    use of analogy based on a general statement, both groups\\n    rest on shaky ground.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    The saying of the Prophet, which uses the expression\\n    alladhi yaqtadhi, reads: \"From what the heavens water, a\\n    tithe [is due], and from what is watered by irrigation\\n    [nadh] a half a tithe.\" The relative pronoun ma is used\\n    to mean al-ladhi, which is a general expression.

This hadith is said to be munqati\\n    that is--a hadith with an interrupted chain.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Both Abu Hanifah and Mujahid hold that zakah is due on\\n    any amount, little or big, in accordance with the generic\\n    nature of the Prophet's saying: \"From what the heavens\\n    water, a tithe [is due] ...\" This is because land produce\\n    is perishable and cannot be preserved for a whole year.\\n    In that case, such produce does not attain a nisab within\\n    a one-year period.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ibn al-Qayyim's discussion of the subject is that the\\n    authentic and explicit sunnah for a tithe's nisab is the\\n    hadith: \"From what the heavens water, a tithe [is due],\\n    and from what is watered by irrigation (gharb-vessel) a\\n    half a tithe.\" This is applicable to both small and large\\n    quantities as opposed to the specific amount mentioned in\\n    other hadith. In its application, a generic statement is\\n    as important as a specific one. Should there be a\\n    conflict between the two, then the most comprehensive\\n    will be applicable. This is the rule.\\n   </p><p>\\n    It has been said that both of the preceding hadith ought\\n    to be followed. In their essence, they do not contradict\\n    each other, nor does one of them have to cancel the\\n    other. The Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, has to\\n    be obeyed in this matter, for he said: \"From what the\\n    heavens water, a tithe [is due] . . .\" This saying seeks\\n    to distinguish between the two (categories): one on which\\n    a tithe is due, and the other on which only half of the\\n    tithe is due. He therefore distinguished between the two\\n    categories only in respect to the amount due. There is no\\n    mention of any amount of nisab in this hadith. However,\\n    he mentioned it explicitly in another hadith which cannot\\n    be ignored as something that is general or is intended to\\n    be so and not otherwise. It is similar to other\\n    statements of general import which have been explained in\\n    the texts.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ibn Qudamah concludes: \"The saying of the Prophet, upon\\n    whom be peace, that 'there is no sadaqah [zakah] on\\n    anything less than five awsuq' is agreed upon. This\\n    hadith is specific, and for this reason takes precedence\\n    and clarifies his previous statement of general import.\\n    This is similar to his saying that 'zakah is due on all\\n    freely grazing camels,' which becomes explicit by his\\n    other saying on the same subject: 'There is no sadaqah on\\n    less than five camels.' Likewise his saying: 'Sadaqah on\\n    silver is a fourth of the tithe,' becomes specific by a\\n    latter utterance: 'There is no sadaqah on any amount less\\n    than five ounces.' Thus, it is possible to have holdings\\n    which qualify for sadaqah per se, but on which it is not\\n    levied.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    When it comes to land produce, possession of a property\\n    for a year cannot be used as criterion, because their\\n    maturity or growth is completed by the time of harvest,\\n    and not by their continuity extended beyond a year.\\n    However, possession is considered for goods other than\\n    land produce since it is generally assumed that by the\\n    end of the year they must have completed their growth.\\n    The principle of attaining a nisab on any property is\\n    based on the understanding that a nisab is an amount\\n    large enough to be subjected to zakah. This may be\\n    explained by recalling that sadaqah is obligatory for the\\n    rich, which presupposes the existence of nisab generated\\n    by their holdings. For produce which cannot be measured\\n    but qualifies for zakah, a sa'a is used. One sa'a is a \\n    measure equal to one and one-third cups (gadah). Thus, a\\n    nisab is fifty kaylah (kaylah is a dry measure of weight,\\n    in Egypt it is equal to 16.72 L). As to the produce which\\n    cannot be measured, Ibn Quadamah says: \"The nisab of\\n    saffron, cotton and such items is to be weighed at 1,600\\n    Iraqi pounds (ratl, an Iraqi ratl equals approximately\\n    130 dirhams). Thus, its weight is estimated.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Abu Yusuf says that if the produce cannot be measured,\\n    then zakah can only be levied on it when its value\\n    attains the nisab of articles subject to the lowest\\n    standard of measurement. Thus, zakah will not be levied\\n    on cotton until its value reaches five awsuq of an\\n    article to the lowest value so measured, such as barley\\n    and the like. This is because it is impossible to measure\\n    the article in itself except by the lower price of two\\n    nisabs. According to Muhammad ibn al-Hasan: \"For zakah, a\\n    product has to reach five times the greatest value of its\\n    kind. Thus, zakah is not payable on cotton when it\\n    reaches five qintars, because evaluation by means of\\n    wusuq is based on the consideration that its value is\\n    higher than what is valued in kind.\"\\n   </p>"

Thus, you would\\n    come back from where you had started.\" He said this three\\n    times. Abu Hurairah heard this in person.\\n   </p><p>\\n    This hadith does not provide evidence to the effect that\\n    zakah should not be taken from kharaj land. The scholars\\n    interpret it to mean that the conversion of these\\n    countries to Islam would eliminate land tax. It may also\\n    have alluded to dissensions which could prevail at the\\n    end of time and which would lead to neglecting or\\n    fulfilling the obligation of zakah, jizyah and other such\\n    dues by them.\\n   </p><p>\\n    An-Nawawi says: \"If this hadith means what they [the\\n    Hanafiyyah] claim, then it means that zakah could not be\\n    enjoined on dirhams, dinars, and merchandise. If this is\\n    so, then nobody subscribes to it.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    It was reported that when the dahqan (grandee) of Bahr\\n    al-Mulk embraced Islam, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab said: \"Give\\n    him the land and collect the land tax from him.\" This is\\n    a clear statement on the matter of taking kharaj without\\n    demanding payment of the tithe.\\n   </p><p>\\n    This incident indicates that kharaj is not cancelled for\\n    any person after he embraces Islam, nor does it lead to\\n    the cancellation of tithe. He mentioned kharaj here as a\\n    way of stating that it will not be cancelled by embracing\\n    Islam, like jizyah. As for the tithe, it is well known\\n    that it is binding on a free Muslim, so there is no need\\n    to mention it. He also did not mention the levy of zakah\\n    on cattle. This holds for the payment of zakah on silver\\n    and gold and other valuables. Perhaps the dahqan\\n    (grandee) did not possess anything which required the\\n    levy of a tithe on it.\\n   </p><p>\\n    It is said that the practice of the rulers and imams was\\n    not to combine the 'ushr and kharaj. Ibn al-Mundhir\\n    disapproves of such a practice because 'Umar ibn\\n    'Abdulaziz did combine the two.\\n   </p><p>\\n    It is also said that kharaj is the opposite of 'ushr.\\n    This means that kharaj is a consequence of conquest,\\n    whereas 'ushr is an act of worship. Therefore, the two\\n    cannot be combined (at one time) and obtained\\n    simultaneously from the same person. This held true in\\n    the beginning (when lands were conquered), but it is not\\n    tenable in the long run. Nevertheless, not all forms of\\n    kharaj are based on force and conquest since some of its\\n    forms are instituted without force as, for example, in\\n    the case of lands adjoining a kharaj land or in the case\\n    of acquired and revived land watered with streams.\\n   </p><p>\\n    It is also said that the reason behind the imposition of\\n    kharaj and 'ushr is one--that is, an actually or\\n    potentially yielding land. This can be explained by\\n    recalling that if it is marsh land of no benefit\\n    (sabkhah), there is no kharaj or 'ushr on it. That is,\\n    one cause cannot demand two dues of the same kind. This\\n    is similar to the case of an individual who for a year\\n    possesses free-grazing camels (sa'imah) intended for\\n    sale, for such a person is not required to pay two kinds\\n    of zakah--that is, one for possession and one for trade.\\n   </p><p>\\n    This is not the case because the 'ushr (tithe) is payable\\n    on the land's produce and the kharaj on the land itself,\\n    regardless of whether it is planted or not. As to the\\n    admissibility of the unity of cause, alKamal ibn al-Humam\\n    explains there is nothing to prevent two obligations from\\n    being connected to one cause, such as land.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Most scholars are of the opinion that anyone who rents a\\n    piece of land and cultivates it must pay the zakah, not\\n    the true owner of that land. To this Abu Hanifah replies:\\n    \"Zakah is due on the land owner.\" Ibn Rushd holds: \"Their\\n    difference lies in whether the 'ushr is payable on the\\n    land itself or its produce.\" Obviously, zakah, as their\\n    views suggest, is payable on either of them. The\\n    difference is only of priority, considering that both the\\n    produce and the land belong to the same owner. Most\\n    scholars say that zakah is due on seeds (habb). Abu\\n    Hanifah holds that the essence of obligation rests with\\n    the land. Ibn Qudamah inclines toward the majority's view\\n    and says: \"The obligation lies on the produce and is\\n    payable by its owner, as in the case of zakah on the\\n    value [of a property] intended for trade. Also, it is\\n    similar to the tithe payable on the produce of the land\\n    owned.\" Their (the Hanafiyyah) view is not authentic, for\\n    if zakah were to be levied on the value of the land, then\\n    it would have been obligatory even if the land was not\\n    cultivated, as is the case with the land tax, and even\\n    nonMuslirns would not be excluded from its application.\\n    Be that the case, kharaj would have to be estimated on\\n    the land itself, not on the value of produce--that is, it\\n    would be considered part of the expenditure of fay', not\\n    the expenditure of zakah.\\n   </p>"

A man came with a great humped camel\\n     (kawma), but he did not accept it as zakah.\" It\\n     was reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and anNasa'i.\\n    </li><li>\\n     Anas reported that Abu Bakr wrote to him: \"These\\n     are the sadaqah stipulations which the Messenger\\n     of Allah, upon whom be peace, made obligatory to\\n     the Muslims. [And of it] do not combine. There is\\n     no need to gather [young and old] animals nor to\\n     separate them to obtain the correct sadaqah\\n     amount. What happens to a mixture of young and\\n     old? When zakah is assessed on two associates,\\n     then they have to figure it out equally among\\n     them.\" AlBukhari relates this.\\n    </li></ul><p>\\n    Malik, in alMuwatta', says: \"There are, for example,\\n    three partners, each having forty sheep on which zakah is\\n    payable. If they add their sheep together, their zakah\\n    will be only one sheep. Or, another example: two partners\\n    have 201 sheep. Their zakah will be three sheep. If they\\n    divide the flock among them, their zakah will be one\\n    sheep each.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ash-Shaf'i holds that this statement is addressed to both\\n    the owner and the zakah collector. Each is ordered not to\\n    add or separate his possessions to obtain a lower or\\n    higher sadaqah. Since the owner would naturally prefer a\\n    low sadaqah on his property, he would combine or separate\\n    his possessions accordingly. The same would also be true\\n    of the zakah collector, who might like to collect as much\\n    sadaqah as possible. By using the phrase khashyat\\n    assadaqah (for fear of sadagah), the Prophet meant that\\n    it may become more or less since both altematives were\\n    possible. This shows that he did not prefer one choice\\n    over the other. Therefore, he made both altematives\\n    possible. According to the Hanafiyyah: \"This is, in a\\n    sense, a prohibition on the zakah collector's separating\\n    the property of a person so that his sadaqah is not\\n    increased. For example: a man possesses 120 sheep. If\\n    they are divided into three lots of forty each, the zakah\\n    would amount to three sheep. Another example: if they\\n    combine the property of one man with the property of\\n    another, the sadaqah would increase. Thus, if a person\\n    owns 101 sheep and another owns an equal number, then the\\n    zakah collector, if he combines the two lots, would\\n    secure three sheep as payment toward zakah, while the\\n    actual amount due is only two sheep.\"\\n   </p>"

On the other hand,\\n    a combination of 101 sheep with the same number results\\n    in a zakah of one and one-half sheep.

Concerning payment of\\n    zakah from a different lot of wheat, barley, dates, gold,\\n    silver, camels, cattle, and sheep, he says it does not\\n    matter whether one pays it from the same lot, from a\\n    different one in one's possession, or from a lot that may\\n    be bought, granted as a gift, or borrowed.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The conviction that the payment of zakah is the owner's\\n    responsibility and is not necessarily that of the\\n    property itself is a sound principle, for if it becomes\\n    due on the property itself, the owner will not be\\n    permitted to make payment from a different lot. It is\\n    similar to the case of one partner being prevented from\\n    giving his money to his copartner from a source other\\n    than the one involved in their partnership--unless the\\n    partners approve of it and it does not violate the\\n    conditions of the transaction between them. Furthermore,\\n    if zakah has to be applied to the property itself, only\\n    two situations can arise. First, zakah is payable on all\\n    parts of that property and is applicable to any\\n    individual amount of it, without individual\\n    specification. Second, if it is applicable to every part\\n    of it, it is impermissible to sell from any herd or grain\\n    since zakah collectors in this case would become\\n    partners. Thus, the proprietor is not allowed to take\\n    anything from it. This is void without any dispute.\\n    Furthermore, it would become obligatory upon him to\\n    specify exactly the price of the sheep which he desires\\n    to take out, just as is done in partnerships. If zakah is\\n    due on any part of it other than the property itself, it\\n    becomes void. This holds true in such a case since he\\n    does not know what he might sell or whether he is taking\\n    what is due for the sadaqah collectors. This, in turn,\\n    backs up the above.\\n   </p>"

Abu Hanifah holds that it vitiates the\\n    payment of zakah if all the property perishes without the\\n    owner's role in its destruction. When part of it\\n    perishes, the perished portion is not subject to zakah.\\n    This is in accordance with the rule that zakah is\\n    associated with the property itself. However, when the\\n    property is deliberately destroyed by the owner, zakah\\n    has to be paid. Ash-Shaf'i, alHassan ibn Salih, Ishaq,\\n    Abu Thaur, and Ibn al-Mundhir hold that if the nisab\\n    perishes before zakah is paid, then the owner owes\\n    nothing. However, if it perishes subsequent to the\\n    accumulation of the nisab, the owner has to pay it. Ibn\\n    Qudamah supports this view and says it vitiates the\\n    payment of zakah if the property perishes without any\\n    negligence on the part of the owner.

On\\n    the contrary, if he did not have the nisab, or the\\n    holdings were not in his possession, or they were to be\\n    purchased and he could not, then this does not constitute\\n    an act of negligence.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Likewise, if it is presumed that the obligation to pay\\n    zakah remains even after the holdings are lost, and the\\n    owner has the means to pay it, then he must do so.\\n    Otherwise, he should be granted a respite in order to\\n    fulfill his obligation to pay zakah.

In the following hadith, the\\n    text indicates that the needy are the poor who are not\\n    noticed by the people because they abstain from begging.\\n    The Qur'an takes note of them because they, perhaps due\\n    to their modesty, go unnoticed.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah, upon\\n    whom be peace, said: \"The needy person (miskin) is not\\n    one who goes around asking the people for a date or two,\\n    or for a mouthful or two, but the one who is too\\n    embarrassed to ask.

The Prophet, upon whom be\\n     peace, allowed him to think about his situation\\n     for four months and then choose for himself.

The\\n     Prophet, upon whom be peace, borrowed his armory\\n     for the expedition of Hunayn, and in return gave\\n     him a large number of camels, loaded with goods,\\n     that were at a certain valley.

For instance, 'Uyainah\\n    ibn Hisn, al-Aqra' ibn Habis, and al-'Abbas ibn Mirdas\\n    came to Abu Bakr and requested their share. He wrote them\\n    a letter, which they took to 'Umar. He tore the letter\\n    and said: \"This is something that the Prophet, upon whom\\n    be peace, used to give you to reconcile you to Islam.\\n    Now, Allah has fortified Islam and it is no longer in\\n    need of you. Unless you stay with Islam, the sword will\\n    be between you and us. Say: 'It is the truth from the\\n    Lord of you [all].

You wrote a letter for us and 'Umar tore it up.\"\\n    He answered: \"This is the way it is.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    The Hanafiyyah continue: \"Indeed, Abu Bakr agreed with\\n    'Umar, and none of the companions disapproved of it.\\n    Likewise, it was never reported from 'Uthman or 'Ali that\\n    they gave anything to anyone in this category.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    It can be answered that the case under reference was\\n    'Umar's own judgment. He saw that there would be no\\n    benefit in mollifying these people after Islam had become\\n    well-established among their people, and no harm would\\n    follow if they abandoned Islam. Also, if 'Uthman and 'Ali\\n    stopped spending this kind of endowment, this does not\\n    necessarily mean that the provision for it was repealed.\\n    It is possible that the change of circumstances did not\\n    call for the continuation of such an endowment to the\\n    nonbelievers. However, this does not amount to the\\n    invalidation of the provision for such endowments. Should\\n    the contingency call for its revival, the endowments in\\n    this category can be given. This is because their\\n    sanction lies in the Qur'an and sunnah.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ahmad and Muslim reported from Anas that whenever the\\n    Prophet, upon whom be peace, was asked for anything for\\n    the sake of Islam, he would give it away. A man came and\\n    asked for sadaqah. The Prophet ordered that the man be\\n    given the entire lot of sheep between two mountains.\\n    These sheep were part of the sadaqah. The man returned to\\n    his people and said: \"Oh my people! Accept Islam, for\\n    indeed, Muhammad gives in such a way as if he does not\\n    fear poverty.\" Ash-Shaukani says that al-'Itrah,\\n    al-Jobbani, al-Balkhi, and Ibn Mubashshir held that\\n    sadaqah may be given to those whose hearts are to be\\n    reconciled to Islam. On the contrary, ash-Shaf'i\\n    maintains that such endowments are not for unbelievers.\\n    As for the sinner (faszq), he may be given from such\\n    allocations.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Abu Hanifah and his followers hold that this kind of\\n    endowment was cancelled with the spread and domination of\\n    Islam and, as evidence, they cite Abu Bakr's refusal to\\n    restore endowments to Abu Sufyan, 'Uyainah, al-Aqra', and\\n    al-'Abbas ibn Mirdas. It appears that reconciliation is\\n    permitted when the need for it arises. In other words, it\\n    is permitted to give them sadaqah for reconciliation when\\n    a people obey a leader only for worldly affairs, and they\\n    cannot be controlled except by force and domination. The\\n    spread of Islam has no ramification on the issue of\\n    reconciliation because it makes no difference in this\\n    case. The author of al-Manar testifies: \"This is the\\n    whole truth. Only independent judgment can be exercised\\n    to elaborate on the eligibility and the amount of sadaqah\\n    or booty to be given away when they are available, along\\n    with other kinds of property [immovable and movable]. It\\n    is necessary to seek consultation of capable people (ahl\\n    ashShura) as the caliphs did in those matters that\\n    required ijtihad. Whether a leader can force them into\\n    obedience by coercive action before resorting to the use\\n    of the endowment is an unsettled issue. Nevertheless,\\n    this cannot be followed as a rule but rather as the\\n    principle of inclining to the lesser of two evils and to\\n    the best benefit of the society.\"\\n   </p>"

According to Ibn\\n    'Abbas, al-Hasan al-Basri, Malik, Ahrnad ibn Hanbal, Abu\\n    Thaur, and Abu 'Ubaid, it means using zakah in the\\n    release of any kind of slave. Al-Bukhari and Ibn\\n    al-Mundhir are also supportive of this view. Their\\n    rationale is that the expression wa fi ar-riqab cannot be\\n    confined to the kind of slavery arising from a contract\\n    because, if that had been the case, then it would have\\n    fallen under the category of those in debt (gharimln),\\n    for theirs is an obvious case of debt. As such, freeing a\\n    slave from bondage is better than helping a contracted\\n    slave. He could be aided or helped, but not freed, for\\n    the contracted slave is a slave as long as he owes even\\n    one dirham. At the same time, freeing a slave is possible\\n    at any time, in contrast to the situation of a contracted\\n    slave.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Commenting on the subject, az-Zuhri says that the\\n    preceding position entails two possibilities. The\\n    Qur'anic 'ayah on the subject alludes to these two\\n    possibilities, which have been pointed out by ashShaukani\\n    in his Muntaqa al-Akhbar. In the hadith narrated by\\n    alBara', evidence suggests that redeeming necks is not\\n    the same as freeing them. Nor is the deed of freeing\\n    slaves the same as helping contracted ones with money to\\n    pay off the contract.

If other\\n    categories are for some reason ineligible for their\\n    share, it will be distributed among those still eligible.\\n    It is not permissible to disregard any category if it\\n    meets the conditions for eligibility. Ibrahim anNakha'i\\n    says that if the amount of zakah received is large, then\\n    it is possible to divide it among the different\\n    categories. However, if it is small, it is permissible to\\n    place it into one category. Ahmad ibn Hanbal holds that\\n    the division of zakah has a priority but that it is\\n    permissible to give it all to one category. Malik\\n    maintains that the distributor of zakah should make an\\n    effort to investigate those who are in need. He should\\n    distribute it according to the immediate condition of the\\n    needy and poor people. Thus, if he sees in certain years\\n    that the poor need more, they should be given priority.\\n    If he sees in another year that the wayfarers are more\\n    needy, he should distribute it among the travelers. The\\n    Hanafiyyah and Sufyan athThauri thought that the zakah\\n    payer can choose the categories he wished to distribute\\n    the zakah to. This is related by Hudhaifah and Ibn\\n    'Abbas. Al-Hasan alBasri and 'Ata' ibn Abi Rabah base\\n    their opinions on it. Abu Hanifah holds that the\\n    distributors of zakah may give it to one person under any\\n    of the eight categories.\\n   </p>"

                "text": "<p>\\n    The author of ar-Rawdah an-Nadiyyah says: \"Distributing\\n    all of the zakah to one group is more benefiting to the\\n    realization of the word of Allah.\" In brief, one may say\\n    that Allah made zakah applicable only to the eight\\n    specifically mentioned categories. Spelling out these\\n    categories does not mean that the zakah has to be\\n    distributed among them equally or even that it has to be\\n    divided among them. The intended meaning, however, is\\n    that the categories of sadaqah are similar to various\\n    groups of people who are eligible for it. Thus, one who\\n    is obligated to pay anything to any category of sadaqah\\n    and gives it to a person in a parallel group is\\n    considered to be fulfilling what Allah commanded him to\\n    do. Contrary to this, if one divides his zakah due into\\n    the acknowledged eight categories, if all eight exist,\\n    then that would not only be contrary to the practice of\\n    the Muslims throughout history, but it would cause\\n    hardship to the payer of zakah. For example, if the\\n    collected zakah were meager, it would be of no benefit to\\n    any designated category--even if it was of one kind, to\\n    say nothing if it was of numerous kinds. To endorse such\\n    a practice would be tantamount to counter what the\\n    Prophet, upon whom be peace, did when he permitted the\\n    payment of a penance (kaffarah) from the charity\\n    collected for Salmah ibn Sakhr. Obviously, the hadith of\\n    as-Suda'i cannot be used as evidence.\\n   </p><p>\\n    There is not a single case in the entire corpus of hadith\\n    literature which could be used to make the distribution\\n    of zakah to all groups of people obligatory. Using the\\n    hadith of Mu'adh as evidence that the Prophet, upon whom\\n    be peace, instructed him to take zakah from the rich\\n    Yemenites and give it to their poor will not be of much\\n    help because it does not establish that the zakah was\\n    distributed to all the groups. Nor is the hadith of Ziyad\\n    ibn al-Harith as-Suda'i valid in this regard because in\\n    its chain of narrators is 'Abdur-Rahman ibn Ziyad\\n    al-'Afriqi, whose credibility has been questioned by many\\n    scholars. Assuming that this hadith is valid for the\\n    point under discussion, the meaning of the division of\\n    zakah into parts is its distribution according to the\\n    apparent meaning of the Qur'anic 'ayah and what the\\n    Prophet, upon whom be peace, had in mind. Assuming that\\n    the division of zakah itself is intended, the\\n    distribution has to be done according to the specified\\n    categories. In this case, any transfer of the share of\\n    one group to another, even if the group concerned was for\\n    some reason non-existent, will not be permissible. Such\\n    an approach will be contrary to the consensus of Muslim\\n    scholars. If we accept that, then the deciding factor for\\n    the sadaqah's distribution is the leader's wish rather\\n    than, and not the specific categories of eligible people.\\n    Thus, there is no evidence that makes division\\n    obligatory, and it is consequently permissible to give\\n    some sadaqah to those eligible people and some to other\\n    groups. Indeed, when the leader collects all the sadaqat\\n    from his people and all eight categories are eligible to\\n    receive them, each group has the right to claim its\\n    share. However, he does not have to divide the collected\\n    sadaqat among them equally or distribute it without any\\n    distinction, for he can give any amount to any group or\\n    groups that he wants to, or he can give some without\\n    giving the rest if he thinks it is in the interest of\\n    Islam and its people. For example, if the sadaqah was\\n    collected and then a jihad was announced, meaning that it\\n    would become necessary to defend the territory of Islam\\n    against the unbelievers, the leader can give some or all\\n    of it to the deserving warriors. This also applies to\\n    other concerns if the interest of Islam necessitates it.\\n   </p>"

Then he joined his fingers [in demonstrating\\n    the close relationship].\" Reason dictates that one should\\n    not differentiate between them (the two families) in any\\n    matter of law because they are one according to the\\n    saying of the Prophet. It is evident that they are the\\n    family of Muhammad, and therefore, sadaqat are forbidden\\n    to them. Abu Hanifah holds that the family of Banu\\n    al-Muttalib may take from zakah. Both these reports are\\n    related by Ahmad. Just as the Messenger of Allah, upon\\n    whom be peace, made charity unlawful for the family of\\n    Banu Hashim, he also made it unlawful for their proteges\\n    (mawla). Abu Rafi', a protege of the Prophet, said that\\n    the latter appointed a man from the family of Banu\\n    Makhzum to collect sadaqat. This man said to Abu Rafi':\\n    \"Accompany me so that you may get some of it.\" He said:\\n    \"No, until I meet the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be\\n    peace, and ask him.\" He left and asked him.

The administration then can\\n    send it to the other place after due consideration of all\\n    the facts.

Most of the scholars also support this view.\\n    When a man resides in one city and his holdings happen to\\n    be in another, consideration will be given to the city\\n    where his holdings are located because the holdings\\n    generated zakah and the eligible people will be eyeing\\n    it. If part of the holdings are with the owner and some\\n    are in another city, zakah will be paid on the portion in\\n    each city. This applies to zakah on one's holdings. As\\n    for the zakah at the end of Ramadan (zakat ul-fitr), it\\n    is distributed in the city where it is due, whether the\\n    payer's holdings are there or not.

We\\n    continued to do so until Mu'awiyyah came to us to perform\\n    pilgrimage (hajj) or a minor pilgrimage ( 'umrah). He\\n    then addressed the people from the pulpit and said to\\n    them: 'I see that two mudds of wheat of Syria equals one\\n    sa' of dates.' The people accepted that.\" However, Abu\\n    Sa'id contended: \"I would continue to give as I used to\\n    give, namely, one sa' as long as I live.\" This is related\\n    by most hadith narrators. At-Tirmidhi remarks: \"Some of\\n    the scholars gave one sa' from every charitable item\\n    [which is accepted as a sound practice].\" Ash-Shaf'i and\\n    Ishaq sustain this view but some other scholars gave one\\n    sa' from every charitable item except wheat, of which\\n    only half a sa' would be sufficient. This is the saying\\n    of Sufyan, Ibn al-Mubarak, and the scholars of Kufah.\\n   </p>"

Ibn 'Umar reports that\\n    the Messenger, upon whom be peace, ordered them to pay\\n    zakat ul-fitr before the people went out to perform the\\n    'id prayers.

                "text": "<p>\\n    Islam views wealth realistically--as an essential aspect\\n    of life and the main means of subsistence of individuals\\n    and groups. Allah, the Exalted One, instructs: \"Give not\\n    to those who are weak of understanding [what is in] your\\n    wealth which Allah has made a means of support for you\"\\n    [an-Nisa' 5]. This amounts to saying that wealth is to be\\n    distributed to meet the basic needs of food, clothing,\\n    lodging, and other indispensables, and that no one is to\\n    be lost, forgotten, or left without support. The best way\\n    to distribute wealth so that everyone's basic needs are\\n    met is through zakah. It does not place any burden on the\\n    wealthy yet at the same time it meets the basic needs of\\n    the poor and relieves them of the hardships of life and\\n    the pain of deprivation. Zakah is not a favor (minnah)\\n    that the wealthy bestow upon the poor; rather, it is a\\n    due (haqq) that Allah entrusted in the hands of the rich\\n    to deliver to the poor and distribute among the\\n    deserving. Thus, the eminent truth about wealth and\\n    property is established--that is, wealth is not\\n    exclusively for the rich but for both the rich and the\\n    poor. This becomes obvious because of Allah's judgment\\n    concerning the distribution of booty (fay'). Allah warns:\\n    \". . . that it does not become a commodity taken by turns\\n    among the rich of you\" [al-Hashr 7]. This means it is an\\n    apportionment of wealth between the rich and the poor,\\n    not something restricted to the wealthy. Zakah is an\\n    obligation due on the property of those able to pay and\\n    is to be used to meet the basic needs of the poor and the\\n    needy so that they could be kept away from hunger and\\n    they could be given a sense of security and general\\n    well-being. If the amount of zakah is not enough to\\n    alleviate the conditions of the poor and the needy, then\\n    the rich can be subjected to further taxation. How much\\n    should be taken is not specified. Its quantity will be\\n    determined by the needs of the poor.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In his interpretation of  alBaqarah 177, al-Qurtubi says:\\n    \"The saying of Allah, the Exalted One: 'And to spend of\\n    your wealth out of love for Him' gives credence to those\\n    who maintain that there is a due on wealth other than\\n    zakah known as mal addir.\" Others hold that the preceding\\n    'ayah alludes to the obligatory zakah. According to\\n    ad-Daraqutni's report from Fatimah bint Qais, the first\\n    view is more convincing. She relates: \"Indeed, there is a\\n    due on one's holdings other than the prescribed zakah.\"\\n    Then he recited the following Qur'anic verse: \"It is not\\n    righteousness that you turn your faces to the East or to\\n    the West, but it is to believe in Allah, the Last Day,\\n    the Angels, the Book, the Messengers, and to spend of\\n    your wealth out of love for Him on your kin, orphans, the\\n    needy, the wayfarer, or those who ask, and on the ransom\\n    of slaves...\" [al-Baqarah 177]. Ibn Majah mentioned it in\\n    his Sunan and at-Tirmidhi in his Jami'. The latter says\\n    that Ibn Majah's has a different chain of narrators than\\n    his. Besides, Abu Hamzah and Maymun al-'A'war consider\\n    Ibn Majah's chain of narrator not credible. This hadith\\n    is related by Bayan and Isma'il ibn Salim from\\n    ash-Shu'bi, who said that it is sound.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The latter says: \"If there is a question about its\\n    authenticity, it is rendered clear by the context of the\\n    'ayah [al-Baqarah 177]. In this statement: '... to be\\n    steadfast in prayer, and to give zakah,' Allah mentions\\n    zakah with salah, which substantiates the fact that 'to\\n    spend of your property out of love for Him' does not\\n    refer to obligatory zakah, for that would be redundant in\\n    the 'ayah--and Allah knows best.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    The scholars agree that should a need arise, even when\\n    zakah has been paid, the Muslim community is bound to\\n    contribute toward the alleviation of the problem.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Malik says: \"It is obligatory for the people to ransom\\n    those taken as prisoners of war, even if doing so\\n    consumes all their property. The consensus on this\\n    subject strengthens our view, and we seek success only\\n    through Allah.\" According to al-Manar, the 'ayah \"... and\\n    to spend your property out of love for Him . . .\"\\n    [alBaqarah 177] means that one should give the property\\n    for the sake of Allah or for the love of giving it.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Imam Muhammad 'Abduh's comments are: \"The giving of\\n    property in excess of the due zakah is considered one of\\n    the basic elements of piety (birr) and is enjoined like\\n    the prescribed zakah.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Whenever the exigency calls for it, sadaqah other than\\n    zakah is given. That could be before the completion of\\n    the year (hawl) or after the payment of zakah. The\\n    contribution is not based on a specific amount of nisab\\n    but on the ability to give. Thus, if someone possesses\\n    only a loaf of bread and sees a person who is more\\n    hard-pressed than himself, he should give it to that\\n    person. The hard-pressed person is not the only one who\\n    has a right to be satisfied, but Allah has also ordered\\n    the believers to give non-prescribed sadaqat to the\\n    following: kin, orphans, needy, wayfarers, beggars, and\\n    slaves.\\n   </p>"

Then he said: \"It is not permissible\\n    for a hard-pressed Muslim to eat the meat of a dead\\n    animal or a pig when he can find surplus food from either\\n    a Muslim or a dhimmi.

Then, whoever\\n    wished to do so would fast and whoever wished to do so\\n    would feed a poor person, and that was sufficient for\\n    them. Then Allah revealed another verse: 'The month of\\n    Ramadan in which the Qur'an was revealed...' to the\\n    words: 'Whoever is resident among you during this month\\n    is to fast.' [By this verse,] the fast was established\\n    for those who were resident and healthy. A concession was\\n    made for the sick and travelers, and the feeding of the\\n    poor by the elderly who could not fast was [left]\\n    confirmed.\" This is related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, and\\n    alBaihaqi with a sahih chain.\\n   </p><p>\\n    A sick person may break his fast which, if continued,\\n    would only aggravate the illness or delay its cure.In\\n    al-Mughni it is stated: \"It is related from some of the\\n    early scholars that any type of illness allows one to\\n    break the fast, even an injury to the finger or a\\n    toothache. They based their opinion on the following: \\n   </p><ul><li>\\n     the wording of the verse is general and applies\\n     to all types of illness, and \\n    </li><li>\\n     a traveler is allowed to break his fast even if\\n     he does not need to and, therefore, the same must\\n     be the case for one who is sick.\" This was also\\n     the opinion of al-Bukhari, 'Ata, and the Dhahiri\\n     school of thought.\\n    </li></ul><p>\\n    One who is healthy but fears that he will become ill if\\n    he fasts can break the fast, as can the person who is\\n    overcome by hunger and/or thirst and fears that he may\\n    die because of it, even if he is resident and healthy. He\\n    must make up the days of fasting that he missed. The\\n    following two Qur'anic 'ayahs support this point: \"And do\\n    not kill yourselves, Lo! Allah is ever Merciful to you,\"\\n    and \"He has not laid upon you in your religion any\\n    hardship.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    If a sick person fasts and withstands the hardships of\\n    the fast, his fast will be valid but disliked, for he did\\n    not accept the concession Allah gave him, thereby causing\\n    himself much hardship. Some of the companions would fast\\n    during the Prophet's lifetime while others would not\\n    (that is, if they were ill), thereby following the\\n    verdict of the Prophet. Hamzah al-Aslami said: \"O\\n    Messenger of Allah, I find within me the strength to fast\\n    while traveling. Would there be any blame upon me if I\\n    were to do so?\" The Prophet, upon whom be peace,\\n    answered: \"It is a concession from Allah. Whoever takes\\n    it has done well. Whoever likes to fast, there is no\\n    blame upon him.\" This is related by Muslim.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported: \"We traveled with the\\n    Messenger of Allah to Makkah while we were fasting. We\\n    stopped at a place and the Messenger of Allah said: 'You\\n    are coming close to your enemies. You will be stronger if\\n    you break the fast.' That was a concession and some of us\\n    fasted and some of us broke our fasts. Then we came to\\n    another place and the Prophet said: 'In the morning you\\n    will face your enemy. Breaking the fast will give you\\n    more strength.' So we broke our fast, taking that as the\\n    best course of action. After that, you could see some of\\n    us fasting with the Prophet while traveling.\" This is\\n    related by Ahmad, Muslim, and Abu Dawud.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In another report, Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: \"We fought\\n    under the leadership of the Messenger of Allah during\\n    Ramadan. Some of us fasted and some of us did not. The\\n    ones who fasted did not find any fault with those who did\\n    not fast, and those who did not fast found no fault with\\n    those who fasted. They knew that if one had the strength\\n    to fast he could do so and it was good, and that if one\\n    was weak, he was allowed to break his fast, and that was\\n    good.\" This is related by Ahmad and Muslim.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The jurists differ over what is preferred (that is, to\\n    fast or not to fast while traveling). Abu Hanifah,\\n    ash-Shaf'i, and Malik are of the opinion that if one has\\n    the ability to fast, it is better for him to do so, and\\n    if one does not have the ability to fast, it is better\\n    for him to break the fast. Ahmad said that it is best to\\n    break the fast. 'Umar ibn 'Abdulaziz says: \"The best of\\n    the two acts is the easier of the two. If it is easier\\n    for one to fast than to make up the day later on, then,\\n    in his case, to fast is better.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ash-Shaukani has concluded that if it is difficult for an\\n    individual to fast or to reject the concession, then it\\n    is best for him not to fast (while traveling). Similarly,\\n    if one fears that one's fasting during travel will look\\n    like showing off, then in this case, breaking the fast\\n    would be preferred. If one is not faced with such\\n    conditions, then fasting would be preferred.\\n   </p><p>\\n    If a traveler makes the intention (to fast) during the\\n    night, he can still break his fast during the day. Jabir\\n    ibn 'Abdullah reported:\\n   </p><p>\\n    \"The Messenger of Allah left for Makkah during the year\\n    of the conquest [of Makkah] and he and the people with\\n    him fasted until he reached a certain valley. He then\\n    called for a cup of water, which he elevated so that the\\n    people could see it, and then he drank. Afterwards, he\\n    was told that some people had continued to fast, and he\\n    said: 'Those are disobedient ones, those are disobedient\\n    ones.' \" This is related by Muslim, at-Tirmidhi, and\\n    an-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi called it sahih.\\n   </p><p>\\n    If one has already made the intention to fast while\\n    resident but then decided to travel during the day, the\\n    majority of scholars maintain that he must fast. Ahmad\\n    and Ishaq say that he may break the fast. This opinion is\\n    based on the report of Muhammad ibn Ka'b who said: \"I\\n    came to Anas ibn Malik during Ramadan while he was\\n    planning on traveling. His mount was prepared for him,\\n    and he was wearing his clothes for traveling. He asked\\n    for some food and ate. I said to him: 'Is this a sunnah?'\\n    He said, 'Yes.' Then he mounted his animal and left.\"\\n    This is related by at-Tirmidhi, who called it\\n    hassan.'Ubaid ibn Jubair said: \"During Ramadan, I rode on\\n    a ship with Abu Basra al-Ghafari from al-Fustat. He\\n    prepared his food and said, \"Come [and eat].\" I said:\\n    \"Are we not still among the houses [of the city - that\\n    is, they had not left yet]?\" Abu Basra asked: \"Are you\\n    turning away from the sunnah of the Messenger of Allah?\"\\n    This is related by Ahmad and Abu Dawud. Its narrators are\\n    trustworthy.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ash-Shaukani contends: \"These two hadith prove that a\\n    traveler may break his fast before he begins his joumey.\\n    Of its credentials, Ibn al-'Arabi says: 'Concerning the\\n    hadith of Anas, it is sahih and proves that one can break\\n    the fast when he is prepared to travel.'\" This is the\\n    correct position.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The type of travel that allows one to break his fast is\\n    the same as the traveling which allows one to shorten the\\n    prayers. We have discussed all of the opinions on this\\n    point under the section Shortening the Prayers, and we\\n    have also recorded Ibn al-Qayyim's conclusions on this\\n    question.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ahmad, Abu Dawud, al-Baihaqi, and at-Tahawi recorded from\\n    Mansur al-Kalbi that Dihya ibn Khalifah traveled a\\n    distance of one farsakh during Ramadan. When he broke his\\n    fast, some of the people accompanying him did likewise.\\n    Some of them did not agree with this action. On his\\n    return to his city, Dihya said: \"I saw some hing today\\n    that I did not suspect I would ever see. The people tumed\\n    away the Messenger of Allah's guidance and that of his\\n    companions.\" He said that about the people who had\\n    fasted. Then he said: \"O Allah, take [my soul] to you.\"\\n    All of its narrators are trustworthy, except for Mansur\\n    al-Kalbi... although al-'Ijli affirms his credibility.\\n   </p>"

Since no one has related that not from the\\n    Prophet, not with an authentic or a weak hadith, nor in\\n    mursal or musnad form then it must be the case that such\\n    acts do not void [the fast].\" He also says: \"If the\\n    ruling is one that would affect everyone or everyday\\n    matters, then the Prophet would have clarified it to a\\n    general audience. It is well-known that kohl was in\\n    common use as were oils, washing, incense, and perfume.\\n    If they broke the fast, the Prophet would have mentioned\\n    them, as he mentioned other things [that break the fast].\\n    Since he did not do so, they belong to the class of\\n    perfumes, incense, and dyes. Incense goes through the\\n    nose and enters the head and lands on the body. Dyes or\\n    oils are absorbed by the skin and the body is refreshened\\n    by it. The case of perfumes is similar. Since these have\\n    not been [explicitly] prohibited to the fasting person,\\n    it points to the fact that using them is permissible for\\n    the fasting person and so is kohl. The Muslims during the\\n    time of the Prophet would injure themselves, either from\\n    jihad or otherwise, and would injure their stomachs or\\n    skulls.

Indeed, it helps\\n    the body to release whatever is in the intestines and it\\n    does not reach the stomach. Any medicine that is used to\\n    treat stomach wounds or head injuries [that is taken\\n    orally] is not considered similar to food.

There is no one in this city who is\\n    poorer than us!\" The Prophet laughed until his molar\\n    teeth could be seen and said: \"Go and feed your family\\n    with it.\" This is related by the group.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Most scholars say that both men and women have to perform\\n    the acts of expiation if they intentionally have\\n    intercourse during a day of Ramadan on which they had\\n    intended to fast. If they had intercourse out of\\n    forgetfulness or not due to choice--that is, due to\\n    coercion, or they did not have the intention to fast,\\n    then the expiation is not obligatory on either one of\\n    them. If the woman was forced to have intercourse by the\\n    man, the expiation will be obligatory only upon the man.\\n   </p><p>\\n    According to ash-Shaf'i, the expiation is not obligatory\\n    upon the woman in any case--that is, regardless if it was\\n    due to choice or coercion, and she need only make up the\\n    day of fasting that she voided. An-Nawawi says: \"The most\\n    authentic opinion, in general, is that the expiation is\\n    obligatory upon the man only and that there is nothing\\n    upon the woman. There is nothing obligatory on her in\\n    relation to this matter, as it is a matter of [paying]\\n    money [due to something related to] sexual intercourse\\n    and this refers to the duty of the man and not the woman.\\n    [In this way,] it is similar to the case of dowry.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Abu Dawud says: \"Ahmad was asked about someone who had\\n    sex during Ramadan: 'Is there any expiation upon the\\n    woman?' He said: 'I have not heard of any.' \" In\\n    al-Mughni it is stated: \"This refers to the fact that the\\n    Prophet ordered the man who had had sexual intercourse to\\n    free a slave. He did not order the woman to do anything,\\n    although he obviously knew that she was a partner in the\\n    act.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    According to most scholars, acts of expiation must be\\n    performed in the order that was mentioned in the hadith.\\n    The first command is to free a slave. If this is not\\n    possible, the person is to fast for two consecutive\\n    months. If that is not possible, the person is to feed\\n    sixty poor people with meals that are similar to an\\n    average meal in his household. The person cannot jump\\n    from one act to another unless he is not able to perform\\n    the prior order commanded. According to the Malikiyyah\\n    and a narration from Ahmad, the person is free to choose\\n    any of the above three acts and that will be sufficient\\n    for him.\\n   </p><p>\\n    This latter opinion is based on the report from Malik and\\n    Ibn Juraij on the authority of Humaid ibn 'Abdurrahman\\n    who reported that Abu Hurairah narrated that a man broke\\n    his fast during Ramadan and the Prophet ordered him, as\\n    an expiation, to free a slave or fast two months\\n    consecutively or to feed sixty poor people. This is\\n    related by Muslim.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In the preceding hadith, the word \"or\" implies choice,\\n    but according to some, the reason for the expiation to be\\n    performed was different and therefore the person could\\n    choose, as in the case of the expiation for breaking an\\n    oath. Ash-Shaukani says: \"In the different narrations,\\n    there is evidence that the expiation is to be performed\\n    in order or according to one's choice. Those who relate\\n    it to be in order are more in number. Al-Muhallab and\\n    al-Qurtubi combined the narrations and said that the\\n    event [of someone breaking the fast] occurred more than\\n    once.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Al-Hafidh differs: \"This is not correct. It was just one\\n    event and the parts are all united. So the crux of the\\n    matter is that there was not more than one event. Some\\n    combine the reports and say that following the order is\\n    preferred, but that one may choose. Others say the\\n    opposite.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Whoever has sexual intercourse (with his wife) on a day\\n    of Ramadan and, before he performs the act of expiation,\\n    has intercourse on another day of Ramadan, need only\\n    perform one act of expiation according to a narration\\n    from Ahmad and the Hanafiyyah. This is because there is a\\n    punishment for acts that are repeated, and if the\\n    expiation or punishment is not carried out, all the acts\\n    are taken together as one. According to Malik,\\n    ash-Shaf'i, and Ahmad, the person must perform the\\n    expiation twice, as each day of Ramadan is a separate act\\n    of worship. If the expiation is obligatory because the\\n    person voided the fast, the separate acts are not\\n    combined together.\\n   </p><p>\\n    All scholars agree that if the person intentionally had\\n    intercourse during a day of Ramadan and has performed the\\n    expiation and then has intercourse on another day of\\n    Ramadan, then another expiation becomes obligatory upon\\n    him. Similarly, they are in agreement that if one has\\n    intercourse twice during a day, before performing the\\n    expiation for the first act, then he need only perform\\n    one act of expiation. If he has performed the expiation\\n    for the first one, then he need not perform an act of\\n    expiation for the second, according to most scholars.\\n    Ahmad says that in such a case, he must perform a total\\n    of two acts of expiation.\\n   </p>"

However, it\\n    does not nullify it unless one ejaculates. Malik says\\n    that it nullifies the i'tikaf, for it is an illegal touch\\n    regardless of whether the person involved ejaculates or\\n    not. From ash-Shaf~i there are two reports that\\n    correspond to the two preceding opinions.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ibn Rushd explains that: \"The reason for their\\n    differences of opinion is [the (fact) that] if a word has\\n    more than one meaning, one being literal and the other\\n    figurative, does the word apply at one time to all of\\n    them or not? This is one of the types of words that have\\n    more than one meaning. Those who say that it carries both\\n    meanings interpret 'touch' in the 'ayah . . . 'and touch\\n    them not and be at your devotions in the mosque' in the\\n    unrestrictive sense--that is, covering both sexual\\n    intercourse and also actions [of touching] that are less\\n    than that. Those who don't say it carries all of its\\n    meanings and they are the majority say that the 'ayah\\n    points to sexual intercourse or to touching that is less\\n    than intercourse. If we say that it refers to sexual\\n    intercourse by consensus, then this nullifies the\\n    possibility of it referring to actions less than\\n    intercourse, as one [single] word could not be taken in\\n    its literal and figurative meaning [at the same time].\\n    Those who say that what is less than sexual intercourse\\n    is included say so because it falls under the literal\\n    meaning of the verse. Those who differ do not take the\\n    word in its literal and figurative meaning at the same\\n    time.\\n   </p>"

If such a person is able to utter these\\n    words then there is no need for prompting, but he should\\n    rather be advised to do so. Such advice is useful in\\n    cases of persons who are in possession of their faculties\\n    of reason and speech. If one is already mentally impaired\\n    such advice cannot be of benefit. But one who is unable\\n    to speak might say these words in his heart. The scholars\\n    are of the opinion that no pressure should be put on the\\n    dying person. So one should not say to him, \"Say, 'La\\n    ilaha ill-Allah',\" lest he should become annoyed and\\n    utter something improper. One may say the shahadah,\\n    however, in such a way that the dying person might be\\n    able to hear it and repeat it. If he utters it once, he\\n    should not be asked to repeat it unless he says some\\n    words after it. In such a case he should be asked to\\n    repeat shahadah to ensure that it be his last utterance.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Most scholars are of the opinion that one attending a\\n    dying person may repeat only the words: \"La ilaha\\n    ill-Allah,\" according to the apparent meaning of the\\n    hadith. Others are of the opinion that the dying person\\n    should be prompted to utter the two testimonies (that is,\\n    \"I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I\\n    bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and\\n    Messenger\"). The purpose is to remind him of the Oneness\\n    of Allah, which includes both of the two testimonies.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ahmad reported that Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet,\\n    peace be upon him, at the time of her death, turned\\n    toward the Ka'bah and placed her right hand under her\\n    head.

A report\\n    recorded from Ash-Shafi'i says: The body of the deceased\\n    should be laid flat on his back with his feet toward the\\n    Ka'bah, and his face raised a little, facing it. The\\n    majority of scholars, however favor the first position\\n    and hold it to be preferable.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ibn Hibban observes: This hadith refers to the recitation\\n    of Ya Sin for those on the eve of death and not for those\\n    already dead. This interpretation is supported by Ahmad,\\n    who recorded in his Al-Musnad that Safwan states: \"The\\n    most eminent scholars say: 'The recitation of Surah Ya\\n    Sin at the time of a person's death makes death easy for\\n    him'. \"The compiler of Musnad al-Firdaus attributes this\\n    hadith to Abu ad-Darda and Abu Dharr. They both narrated:\\n    \"The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: 'If any person is\\n    on his deathbed and Ya Sin is recited to him, Allah makes\\n    his suffering easier'.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    There is a consensus among scholars regarding the\\n    permissibility of kissing a dead person. The Prophet,\\n    peace be upon him, kissed 'Uthman ibn Maz'un after his\\n    death. Similarly, when the Prophet died, Abu Bakr leaned\\n    over him and kissed him between his eyes saying: \"O my\\n    Prophet! O my best friend! !\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    The guardian of the deceased should wash, wrap, and\\n    arrange for the burial of the body soon after the funeral\\n    prayer for the deceased, because the body might\\n    deteriorate if burial is delayed. This is based on a\\n    report, recorded by Abu Daw'ud from al-Husayn ibn Wujuh\\n    that when Talhah ibn al-Bara fell ill, the Prophet, peace\\n    upon him, said: \"I see that Talhah is on the verge of\\n    death.

Ahmad and Tirmidhi report on the\\n    authority of Ali ibn Abu Talib that the Prophet, peace be\\n    upon him, said: \"O Ali, never delay three things: prayer\\n    when its time approaches, the funeral when death is\\n    confirmed, and marrying a widow or a divorcee when a\\n    suitable match is found for her.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    This means that the judgement regarding a soul's\\n    salvation or perdition or its entry into Paradise is held\\n    in abeyance until its debts are fully paid off and\\n    settled. This applies to a person who leaves some\\n    property upon his death. His debt should be paid out of\\n    the property that he leaves behind. In the case of a\\n    person who dies in debt which he sincerely intended to\\n    pay, but has no property (nor leaves any behind to pay\\n    his debt), according to a confirmed report, his debt will\\n    be settled by Allah, the Exalted. Concerning a person who\\n    dies in debt with sufficient means to pay it and was\\n    willing to do so, but his heirs do not pay it, Bukhari\\n    records on the authority of Abu Hurayrah that the\\n    Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"If anyone takes other\\n    people's money with the intention to repay it and then he\\n    or she should die without settling the debt, Allah will\\n    pay the debt on his behalf. And if anyone takes money or\\n    property (of others) with the intention of destroying it,\\n    Allah will destroy him.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    A hadith recorded by Ahmad, Abu Nu'aym, Al-Bazzar, and\\n    At-Tabarani from the Prophet, peace be upon him, says:\\n    \"The debtor will be summoned before Allah on the Day of\\n    Judgement. Then Allah will ask him: 'O Son of Adam ! Why\\n    did you incur debt and infringe on others ' rights? ' The\\n    man would reply: 'My Lord! You know I took it, but I\\n    neither abused nor lost it. It was stolen or bumed in a\\n    fire or lost its value.' Allah, the Almighty and Exalted,\\n    will say: 'My slave has told the truth, and I am more\\n    entitled (than anyone else) to settle his debt. Then\\n    Allah will issue a command and something will be placed\\n    on his scales causing his good deeds to outweigh his bad\\n    ones. And so, by Allah's Grace, he will enter Paradise'.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    The Prophet, peace be upon him, did not perform funeral\\n    prayers for those who had died in debt. When, however,\\n    Allah the Almighty, granted him certain lands as a result\\n    of conquests, and the community's wealth increased, he\\n    offered funeral prayer for them and settled their debts.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Bukhari reports that the Messenger of Allah, peace be\\n    upon him, said: \"I am nearer to the believers than their\\n    own selves. So if someone dies leaving behind debt, but\\n    no wherewithal to settle it, we shall pay his debt, and\\n    if someone dies and leaves some estate behind him, it is\\n    for his heirs (to pay his debt).\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    This hadith shows that the debt of a deceased Muslim may\\n    be paid from the public exchequer out of the zakah funds\\n    specified as the portion for the people in debt.

O Ibrahim! We are aggrieved at your demise.\" He\\n    also wept when his grand daughter, Umaymah, daughter of\\n    Zainab, died. At this Sa'ad ibn 'Ubadah said: \"O\\n    Messenger of Allah! Are you weeping? Did you not forbid\\n    Zainab from weeping?\" The Prophet, peace be upon him,\\n    replied: \"This (weeping) is the mercy that Allah has\\n    placed in the hearts of His servants. And surely Allah\\n    bestows mercy upon those who are merciful among His\\n    servants.\" A report is transmitted by At-Tabarani on the\\n    authority of Abdullah ibn Zaid to the effect that weeping\\n    without wailing is permitted.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Weeping aloud and wailing cause pain and suffering to the\\n    dead person. It is reported from Ibn 'Umar that when\\n    'Umar was stabbed and he became unconscious the people\\n    around him began crying loudly. When he regained\\n    consciousness he said to them: \"Don't you know that the\\n    Messenger of Allah said: 'A dead person is tormented by\\n    the wailing of the living'.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Abu Musa reports that when 'Umar was wounded Suhaib\\n    cried: \"O my dear brother!\" At this 'Umar said: \"O\\n    Suhaib!

This does\\n    not mean that the dead are actually punished and\\n    tormented because of the wailing of their families for\\n    them, because the Qur'an says that a person is not\\n    accountable for the actions of others.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ibn Jarir reported from Abu Hurairah that he said: \"Your\\n    deeds are shown to your dead relatives. So if these are\\n    good, they are pleased, and if these are bad, they\\n    despise them.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ahmad and Tirmidhi reported on the authority of Anas that\\n    the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"Your deeds are\\n    shown to your dead relatives and kinsfolk. So if these\\n    are good they are pleased, and if these are bad they say:\\n    'O Allah! Let them not die until You have guided them to\\n    the right path as You guided us before'.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    An-N'uman ibn Bashir reports: \"Abdullah ibn Rawahah\\n    fainted and his sister, 'Amrah, started wailing: 'O my\\n    monumental loss!' 'O, my this and that!' When he regained\\n    consciousness, he said to her: 'Every time you said\\n    something (about me) i was asked, \"Are you really what\\n    she said?\"'.\" This is narrated by Bukhari.\\n   </p>"

It is recommended that the body be placed\\n    on an elevated surface i.e., a table or a board. It then\\n    should be stripped of clothes, but his 'awra (private\\n    parts) should be covered. (Ash-Shafi'i says that it is\\n    better to wash the body of the deceased wearing a shirt,\\n    if it is thin enough to let water reach the body. The\\n    Prophet, peace be upon him, was washed this way, but it\\n    was done only in his case. The common practice has been\\n    to cover the 'awra and wash the body) At the washing,\\n    only people whose presence is needed may stay.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The washer, male or female, must be a trustworthy and\\n    pious person who will not broadcast what he or she might\\n    see except what is good.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ibn Majah reports that the Prophet, peace be upon him,\\n    said: \"Trustworthy persons should wash your dead.\" A\\n    washer must utter his or her intention to wash the body\\n    of a specific person. Then he should begin by lightly\\n    pressing the stomach of the deceased so as to expel, if\\n    possible, any remnants from it, and then wash the body of\\n    all impurities. The washer should use a wash cloth or\\n    wrap his or her hand with it, because touching the\\n    private parts of the dead is haram (forbidden). Then he\\n    or she should wash the deceased as in wudu (ablution) for\\n    the salah (obligatory prayers). The Prophet, peace be\\n    upon him, is reported to have said: \"Begin washing the\\n    dead by washing organs on the right, and those parts that\\n    are washed in ablution.\" This is in order to crystalize\\n    the mark of the believer's parts of the body always\\n    washed during wudu that will shine forth brightly on the\\n    Day of Judgement. Then beginning from its right side, the\\n    body should be washed with soap and water, three times.\\n    If soap is not available, then washing with ordinary\\n    water will suffice. If the washer feels that three washes\\n    are not enough to cleanse the body properly, then he may\\n    wash it five or seven times. According to a sahih hadith,\\n    the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"Wash the dead body\\n    an odd number of times, that is, three, five, or seven,\\n    or more if you feel it is necessary.\" (Ibn Abd al-Barr\\n    observes: \"I know about no one who recommended more than\\n    seven washes.\" Ahmad and Ibn al-Mundhir disliked to\\n    exceed beyond seven)\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ibn al-Mundhir said: \"The Prophet instructed the female\\n    washers to wash the dead body more than seven times in\\n    case they felt it was necessary to do so, but it must be\\n    an odd number of times. If the deceased is a female, then\\n    her hair should be loosened, washed, redone, and placed\\n    behind her back. According to a hadith narrated by Umm\\n    'Atiyyah the hair of the Prophet's daughter was done in\\n    three plaits. I asked: 'Did they loosen her hair and then\\n    redo them in three braids?' She said: 'Yes'.\" Muslim\\n    reports this in these words: \"We braided her hair in\\n    three braids, on both sides and in front (of her).\" In\\n    his Sahih, Ibn Hibban says: \"They did so in compliance\\n    with the order of the Prophet: 'Do her hair in three\\n    plaits'.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    After having washed the body, it should be dried with a\\n    clean cloth lest the shroud should get wet. Then some\\n    perfume should be applied to it. The Prophet, peace be\\n    upon him, said: \"When you apply perfume (to the dead),\\n    apply it an odd number of times after washing it.\" This\\n    is reported by AlBaihaqi, Al-Hakim and Ibn Hibban, of\\n    whom the last two consider it a sound hadith.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Abu Wa'il said: \"Ali had some musk, and he requested that\\n    it be applied to his body upon his death. This was of\\n    what was left from the perfume used on the body of the\\n    Prophet upon his death.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    The majority of scholars are of the opinion that clipping\\n    a deceased's finger nails, trimming his mustache, shaving\\n    the hair under his arms or from his private parts is\\n    makruh (disliked). Ibn Hazm, however, considers it\\n    permissible.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The scholars are agreed that the body of the deceased be\\n    rewashed if the stomach excrete something (i.e., urine or\\n    stool) after it had been washed and prior to being\\n    shrouded. They differ, however, whether in such a case\\n    the entire body should be rewashed. Some hold that the\\n    body must be washed again in such a case. Others are of\\n    the opinion that there is no need to wash the whole body\\n    again, while still others hold that at least wudu\\n    (ablution) must be repeated in such a case. Some others\\n    hold that in such a case the entire washing must be\\n    repeated.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The opinions of most scholars concerning washing of the\\n    dead are based on the hadith transmitted by the group on\\n    the authority of Umm 'Atiyyah who said: \"The Prophet came\\n    to our house when his daughter died, and said: 'Wash her\\n    three times, five times, or more than that if you\\n    consider it necessary, with water and sidr (lotus tree\\n    leaves), and after the last wash apply some camphor to\\n    the body, and inform me after you have done so.' So when\\n    we finished washing we informed him. He gave us a cloth\\n    that he wore around his waist, and told us to wrap her in\\n    it as a first sheet of shroud.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    The reason for using camphor, as mentioned by some\\n    scholars, is its pleasant smell, since burial is a time\\n    when angels are present. Besides, it is cool and has a\\n    soothing effect, especially when the body stiffens, and\\n    helps keep various insects away from the body, thus\\n    preventing its early decomposition. In case camphor is\\n    not available, any other substance that has these or some\\n    of these properties may be used instead.\\n   </p>"

They replied, 'O Prophet\\n    of Allah! You were fasting and were resting at the time\\n    and we did not want to bother you. ' He said: 'Do not do\\n    that again.

Then the Prophet,\\n    peace be upon him, went to the grave.

This is a sound hadith that bids us not to\\n    sit or pray at the graves. What is forbidden is to offer\\n    formal prayer (salah) facing a grave. Offering a funeral\\n    prayer at the grave is not forbidden, for funeral prayer\\n    does not have to be offered at any specific place. It is\\n    rather better offered outside a mosque than inside it.\\n    The funeral prayer at the grave is similar to offering it\\n    beside the coffin. In either case the prayer is offered\\n    for the deceased, and his body, whether it is in the\\n    coffin or in the grave, remains in the same position.\\n    Offering prayers other than funeral prayers are forbidden\\n    at graves, for there is a risk that this may tum these\\n    graveyards into mosques, against which the Prophet, peace\\n    be upon him, wamed us. He cursed those who tum graves\\n    into places of worship, saying: 'Some evil people will be\\n    overtaken by the Day of Judgement, including those (evil\\n    people) who tum graves into mosques.'

The wisdom behind it is\\n    that a grave is not made to last forever, but is sure to\\n    disintegrate with the passage of time. whitewashing\\n    graves is decorating them with the beauty of this world\\n    for which the dead have no need. Others think that its\\n    wisdom lies in the fact that whitewashing is done by\\n    burning gypsum (brimstone): This view is supported by a\\n    narration of Zaid bin Arqam who said to a person who\\n    wanted to build something over his son ' s grave and\\n    whitewash it: \"You are wrong and have done a useless\\n    thing.

Tirmidhi said: \"Some scholars, including\\n    Al-Hasan alBasri, hold it permissible to coat the graves\\n    with clay.\" Ash-Shafi'i is also of the same view and sees\\n    no harm in giving the graves a coating of clay.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ja'far bin Muhammad reported from his father: \"The grave\\n    of the Prophet, peace be upon him, was raised one hand\\n    from the ground and was coated with red clay and some\\n    gravel.\" This was narrated by Abu Bakr An-Najjad, but\\n    AlHafiz did not comment on this in his ai-Talkhis.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The scholars also disapprove of building graves with\\n    bricks or wood or burying the dead with a coffin unless\\n    the burial ground was wet or soft.

Adh-Dhahabi said: \"This hadith is an innovated\\n    one, and no prohibition is genuinely reported.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    The Hanbali school holds that inscription on graves is\\n    prohibited, whether it is a portion of the Qur'an or the\\n    name of the deceased.\" The Shafi'i school agrees with\\n    this ruling, but they also hold: \"If the grave is of a\\n    scholar or a righteous man, it is preferable to write his\\n    name on it to make it known.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    The Maliki school holds that writing any portion of the\\n    Qur'an is not permissible, but writing the name and date\\n    of death of the deceased is disliked (makruh) .\\n   </p><p>\\n    The Hanafi school disapproves of writing anything on the\\n    grave and considers it unlawful, except when it is feared\\n    that any trace of the grave might disappear. Ibn Hazm\\n    said: \"It is not disapproved if the name of the deceased\\n    was engraved on a rock.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    It is forbidden in a hadith \"to add more soil than what\\n    was taken out when digging the grave.\" Al-Baihaqi has\\n    dealt with this under a separate chapter entitled, \"No\\n    adding of soil to the grave in excess of what is taken\\n    therefrom.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ash-Shawkani said that: \"Adding apparently here means\\n    adding more soil than what was taken out while digging\\n    the grave.\" Some interpreted the addition to a grave as\\n    making a grave over another one.

Al-Khattabi is of the opinion, however, that\\n    \"This placing of a branch of a palm on the graves, while\\n    saying, \"I hope that this will reduce their punishment\\n    for as long as it remains fresh,\" is a blessed effect of\\n    the Prophet, peace be upon him, and of his supplication\\n    to Allah to lighten their punishment.\"According to\\n    Al-Khattabi, \"He hoped, as it were, that the two would be\\n    relieved of their punishment so long as the palm branch\\n    remained fresh. This, however, does not have anything to\\n    do with the freshness or dryness of the palm branch or\\n    its role in lightening the punishment as such.

(Ibn Majah)\\n   </p><p>\\n    Jarir ibn Abdallah reported: \"The Prophet, peace be upon\\n    him, said: 'Whoever introduces a good practice in Islam\\n    will get its reward and the rewards for all those who\\n    follow these practices after him, without any loss to\\n    their reward. And whoever introduces a bad practice in\\n    Islam will acquire its sin and the sins of all those who\\n    practice it, without any decrease in their sins.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    An account of the righteous deeds performed by others\\n    that continue to be beneficial to the deceased is given\\n    in detail below:\\n   </p><p>\\n    l) Asking Allah for His forgiveness. The scholars agree\\n    that it is good to do this, because Allah says in the\\n    Qur'an: \"Those who came after them say, 'O Allah! Forgive\\n    us and our brothers who preceded us in faith. Do not put\\n    animosity in our hearts for those who believe. Our Lord,\\n    indeed, You are Most Merciful, Most Kind.\" Qur'an 59.10 A\\n    saying of the Prophet, peace be upon him, reads, \"When\\n    you offer the funeral prayer for the deceased, make\\n    supplications for this person.\" This has already been\\n    mentioned above. The Prophet, peace be upon him, taught\\n    us the supplication: \"O Allah! Forgive our living and our\\n    dead.\" Generations of Muslims, both past and present,\\n    have been supplicating to Allah for His mercy and\\n    forgiveness for their dead. Such a practice has continued\\n    without any dissent or disagreement among scholars.\\n   </p><p>\\n    An-Nawawi said, \"The most well-known position of the\\n    Shafi'i school is that this does not benefit the\\n    deceased.\" Ahmad ibn Hanbal and a group of Shafi' i\\n    scholars hold that it does benefit the deceased . The\\n    reciter has an option. He may supplicate for the deceased\\n    to be rewarded for the recitation, saying: \"O Allah!\\n    Grant the reward of what I recited to so-and-so.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ibn Qudamah in al-Mughni stated, \"Ahmad ibn Hanbal said,\\n    'The deceased will receive the reward for every good done\\n    on his behalf. This is proved by textual evidence found\\n    on this subject. The fact that Muslims in every city\\n    gather to recite the Qur'an for the benefit of the\\n    deceased and that they have been doing so without any\\n    disagreement or disapproval show that there is consensus\\n    on this subject'.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Those who hold that the deceased benefits by the\\n    recitation of others make it conditional upon the reciter\\n    not to accept any payment for his recitation. If the\\n    reciter is paid for reciting, it is unlawful for both the\\n    giver and the receiver, and he shall have no reward for\\n    his reciting. Abd Ar Rahman ibn Shibl reported that the\\n    Prophet, peace be upon him, said, \"Recite the Qur'an, and\\n    do good deeds .... Do not neglect it, nor be extreme in\\n    it. Do not make it a means of living nor a source of your\\n    wealth.'' (Reported by Ahmad, At-Tabarani, and\\n    Al-Baihaqi)\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ibn al-Qayyim said, \"Worship is of two types: financial\\n    and physical. The Prophet, peace be upon him, has\\n    informed us that because charity (sadaqah) benefits the\\n    deceased, all other acts of charity will also benefit the\\n    deceased, and that because fasting on his behalf benefits\\n    the deceased, all other physical acts of worship will\\n    likewise benefit the deceased. Similarly the Prophet,\\n    peace be upon him, informed us that the reward of making\\n    Hajj, which involves both physical and financial\\n    sacrifice, does indeed benefit the deceased. Thus these\\n    three types of beneficial acts of worship are supported\\n    by both the revealed texts and reason.\"\\n   </p>"

The best\\n    charity is that which fulfills someone's need and is\\n    continuous.

Otherwise,\\n    giving someone a drink of water from a river or a canal\\n    would not be better than feeding the hungry who need\\n    food. Likewise, supplication and asking forgiveness for\\n    the deceased is beneficial to the deceased, especially\\n    when the supplicant is sincere, earnest, and humble in\\n    his supplication.

The Qur'an states that\\n    'Allah will establish in strength those who believe in\\n    the Word, that stands firm in this world and in the\\n    Hereafter,'  Qur'an 14.27 that is, in the grave.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Ahmad ibn al-Qasim said, I asked, 'O Abu Abdallah!

Similar is the case of those who are not\\n    buried in any grave, e.g., the people who are crucified.\\n    To counter this objection, it is maintained that it is\\n    not impossible. Rather, in physical life we find a\\n    similar example, namely, sleeping. A sleeping person\\n    experiences both pleasure and pain, but his companion\\n    cannot notice any of its effects on him. In fact, even a\\n    person who is wide awake also feels pain and pleasure\\n    when he hears or thinks of his painful or pleasant\\n    experiences, but its effects cannot be noticed.\\n    Considering the unseen in the light of what is seen or\\n    guessing about life after death in terms of the present\\n    life is the mistake of this fallacious thinking.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Obviously Allah has screened the sights and sounds of the\\n    other world from man, and with our limited physical\\n    faculties, we are incapable of perceiving the vast\\n    kingdom of heavens, unless Allah wills it.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The opinion of the majority in this respect is supported\\n    by various hadith.

We will mention here some of the sound hadith\\n    concerning this subject.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Zaid ibn Thabit reported, \"The Prophet, peace be upon\\n    him, was going with us toward the dwellings of Banu\\n    an-Najjar.

My two companions ordered those men to throw\\n    themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river\\n    flowing through the city, and its water was as white as\\n    milk. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then\\n    returned to us after the ugliness of their bodies had\\n    disappeared and they turned in the best shape.' I said to\\n    them, \"I have seen many wonders tonight. What is the\\n    meaning of all that I have seen?\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    They replied, \"We will inform you. As for the first man\\n    you came upon whose head was being crushed with the rock,\\n    he is the symbol of the one who studies the Qur'an and\\n    then neither recites it nor acts on it, and sleeps,\\n    neglects the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came\\n    upon whose mouth, nostrils, and eyes were torn off from\\n    front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out\\n    of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that\\n    it spreads all over the world. And those naked men and\\n    women whom you saw in the oven, they are the adulterers\\n    and the adulteresses, and the man whom you saw in the\\n    river of blood is the usurer.

                "text": "<p>\\n    Ibn al-Qayyim dealt with this subject under a separate\\n    chapter in which he mentions opinions of various scholars\\n    concerning the abode of souls. Mentioning the most\\n    correct position he explained, \"It is said that the\\n    abodes of the souls in barzakh vary considerably. Some of\\n    them are in the highest reaches of the heavens, such as\\n    the souls of the Prophets, peace be upon them all. Their\\n    status also varies as observed by the Prophet, peace be\\n    upon him, during the night of Isra.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Some souls are in the form of green birds who roam around\\n    freely in Paradise. These are the souls of some of the\\n    martyrs, but not all of them. The souls of some martyrs\\n    are prevented from entering Paradise on account of their\\n    debts or some other similar thing. This is supported by a\\n    report by Ibn Hanbal in his Musnad from Muhammad ibn\\n    Abdallah ibn Jahsh that \"A man came to the Prophet, peace\\n    be upon him, and asked, 'O Allah's Prophet! What would I\\n    have if I am killed in the cause of Allah?' The Prophet,\\n    peace be upon him, replied, 'Paradise.'  But, when the\\n    man got up to go, the Prophet added, 'Unless you have\\n    some debts to pay. Gabriel has informed me about it just\\n    now'.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Some souls will be locked out at the gate of Paradise, in\\n    accordance with this hadith: \"I have seen your companion\\n    locked out at the gate of Paradise.\" Other souls are\\n    restricted to their graves as is evident from the hadith\\n    about the martyr who had stolen a cloak (He had stolen it\\n    out of the spoils of war before their proper\\n    distribution) when he was killed, the people asked, \"Will\\n    he have bliss in Paradise?\" The Prophet, peace be upon\\n    him, said, \"By Him in whose hand is my soul, the cloak\\n    which he stole causes a fire to flare over him in his\\n    grave.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    The abode of others is at the gate of Paradise, as\\n    described in a hadith by Ibn 'Abbas that, \"The abode of\\n    martyrs is in a green dome, on a bright river, near the\\n    gate of Paradise. Their provision comes from Paradise in\\n    the morning and in the evening.''  (Ahmad) This does not\\n    apply to Ja'far ibn Abi Talib, whose hands were\\n    transformed into wings, and with these he flies wherever\\n    he wishes in Paradise.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Others remain confined to earth, for these souls cannot\\n    rise to heaven. Indeed, these are base, earthly souls\\n    which do not mix with the heavenly souls, just as they do\\n    not mix with them during their sojourn on earth. A soul\\n    that is oblivious to its Lord, blind to His love,\\n    negligent of His remembrance, and remiss in seeking His\\n    pleasure is a despicable earthly soul. After separation\\n    from its body, it cannot go anywhere, but remains here.\\n    On the other hand, the heavenly soul in this life clings\\n    to the love of Allah and to His remembrance, and seeks\\n    His pleasure and nearness. After separation from its\\n    body, it will join other kindred heavenly souls. In the\\n    barzakh (Literally an interval, a separation or a\\n    partition, Al-barzakh may be defined as the intervening\\n    state between death and the Last Day) and on the Day of\\n    Resurrection a person will be with those he loved. Allah\\n    will join some souls with others in the abode of barzakh\\n    and on the Day of Resurrection, placing the believer's\\n    soul with other pure souls, that is, other pure souls\\n    kindred to his soul. A soul, after separation from the\\n    body, joins other kindred souls who in their nature and\\n    deeds are similar to it and stays with them.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Some souls would be thrown in an oven or a pit along with\\n    other fornicators and harlots. Other souls would be in a\\n    river of blood, floating therein and swallowing rocks.The\\n    two categories of souls - the blessed and the damned - do\\n    not share a similar abode, for there are souls that\\n    reside in the highest reaches of heavens, while the\\n    others, low and mean earthly souls, cannot rise above the\\n    earth.\\n   </p><p>\\n    When one ponders the hadith and traditions on this\\n    subject carefully, one can easily find the reason for\\n    this. There is no contradiction in the sound traditions\\n    on this subject. In fact, they are all true and each\\n    supports the other. It is important, however, to\\n    understand the soul and to appreciate its essence and the\\n    laws that govern its functions. Indeed, the soul is\\n    something completely different from the body. It is in\\n    Paradise, but at the same time is attached to the grave\\n    and the body in it. It is the swiftest thing in moving,\\n    relocating, ascending, or descending from one place to\\n    another.These souls are divided into various categories:\\n    the ones that are free to move about, those that are\\n    confined, the ones that are celestial, and the others\\n    that are earthly and of a low order. After separation\\n    from their bodies, souls do experience health and\\n    sickness, and they feel far more pleasure and pain than\\n    they experienced when they were joined together.They are\\n    subject to confinement, pain, punishment, sickness, and\\n    grief as they are to various states of joy, rest, bliss,\\n    and freedom. How similar is its condition in the body to\\n    when it was in the womb of its mother! And likewise how\\n    analogous is its situation after separation from the body\\n    to when it came out of the womb into this world! There\\n    are four abodes of the soul, and each abode is bigger and\\n    greater than the previous one.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The soul's first abode is the womb of the mother, where\\n    there is confinement, compression, seclusion, and three\\n    layers of darkness.The second abode is its earthly\\n    habitat where it grows, does good and evil, and\\n    accumulates blessings for its ultimate success or\\n    failure. Its third abode is the abode of barzakh, which\\n    is more spacious and immense than the abode of this\\n    world. This abode, compared to the fourth one, is like\\n    this [third] abode compared to the first abode.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The fourth abode is the abode of eternity, either\\n    Paradise or Hell. There is no other abode after\\n    these.Allah causes the soul to pass through these abodes\\n    in stages, until it reaches the abode most suitable for\\n    it, an abode that only it deserves and for which it is\\n    [uniquely] suitable, because this abode was created for\\n    it, and the soul was given the ability to perform the\\n    deeds that lead precisely to this abode.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In each abode the soul enjoys a peculiar status and\\n    position altogether different from what it has in other\\n    abodes. Blessed indeed is soul's Originator and Creator,\\n    Who gives it life, causes it to die, makes it happy or\\n    subjects it grief and sorrow. Blessed is He Who appointed\\n    for it various levels of success and failure, and\\n    distinguished them by various grades in accordance with\\n    their knowledge, performance, faculties, and\\n    morality.Whoever truly understands and appreciates this\\n    cannot, but bear witness to the fact that there is no\\n    deity except Allah, Who has no partners. With Him alone\\n    rests all authority, praise, and all that is good, and to\\n    Him alone all affairs return for decision. His is the\\n    absolute authority, and all dominion, might, honor,\\n    wisdom, and perfection free of any defects or\\n    imperfections. He is known through the testimony of His\\n    truthful Prophets and Messengers. They did indeed come\\n    with Truth. Reason testifies to its truthfulness, and\\n    nature supports and confirms it. And anything that\\n    contradicts this testimony is untrue.\\n   </p>"

Qur'an 29.45\\n    In other words, the remembrance of Allah has a greater\\n    impact in restraining one from shameful and unjust deeds\\n    than just the formal regular prayer. This is so because\\n    when a servant opens up his soul to his Lord, extolling\\n    His praise, Allah strengthens him with His light,\\n    increasing thereby his faith and conviction, and\\n    reassuring his mind and heart. This refers to \"those who\\n    believe, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the\\n    remembrance of Allah, for without doubt in the\\n    remembrance of Allah do hearts find satisfaction.''\\n    Qur'an 13.28\\n   </p><p>\\n    And when hearts are satisfied with the Truth, they turn\\n    to the highest ideals without being deflected by impulses\\n    of desire or lust.

Thereupon the Prophet, peace\\n    be upon him, said, \"Give yourselves a respite, you are\\n    not calling upon someone deaf or absent.

Whatever Allah wills will\\n    happen and what He does not will, cannot happen. There is\\n    no power or strength except with Allah, the Exalted, the\\n    Mighty.

(A hadith reported from a\\n    Companion through words or acts uninterruptedly or\\n    otherwise) They all prove that the ability to arrange\\n    one's provisions and possession of means of journey is a\\n    necessary prerequisite for Hajj, and this despite the\\n    fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) knew that many\\n    of the people (in his time) were able to go for Hajj on\\n    foot.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Similarly the words of Allah: \"Pilgrimage thereto is a\\n    duty men owe to Allah - those who can afford the journey\"\\n    underline the fact that ability and power are the\\n    necessary prerequisite for all forms of worship. It\\n    signifies the unspecified power or a little bit more than\\n    what may be necessary. In the case of sawm (fasting) and\\n    salah (obligatory prayers) the financial ability is\\n    superfluous and is not specified in the Qur'an, unlike\\n    Hajj for which it is an important requirement. Similarly,\\n    Hajj is a form of worship which involves traveling for\\n    which one must be in possession of sufficient means to\\n    support oneself (and one' s family), as well as be able\\n    to shoulder the cost of the journey as in jihad.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In this regard we may refer to the Qur'anic verse\\n    (9.91-92) \"Nor is there any blame on those who find no\\n    resources to spend, nor is there (blame) on those who\\n    come to you to be provided with mounts, and when you\\n    said, 'I can find no mounts for you,.\"'\\n   </p><p>\\n    In Al-Muhadhib we read: \"If someone has the money to buy\\n    provisions and the passage to Hajj but he needs it to pay\\n    his debts, Hajj is not binding on him, whether the\\n    settlement of the debt is required immediately or is due\\n    after a time. The debts that are due for immediate\\n    settlement must be paid at once, whereas the Hajj may be\\n    performed later on in life. But if he spends all that he\\n    has on Hajj he may not be in a position to pay off his\\n    debt.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    Similarly, if one is in need of a dwelling or a servant\\n    to help him, he may be classified as unable to perform\\n    Hajj. Likewise, if one needs to take a wife because he\\n    fears he may not be able to avoid evil, he must get\\n    married, for it is his immediate need. Furthermore, if\\n    one needs goods for his business to obtain requisite\\n    resources therefrom, such a one, according to Abul\\n    'Abbas, Ibn Sarih, may be classified as unable to perform\\n    Hajj in view of his specific need. Al-Mughni says: \"If\\n    the debt is owed to a wealthy person who does not demand\\n    immediate settlement of the loan, defers settlement to a\\n    later stage, and is ready to permit the debtor to proceed\\n    for Hajj, then such a debtor is (technically) able to\\n    perform Hajj. But in case the lender cannot afford to\\n    defer settlement of the loan, the debtor would be\\n    reckoned as unable to perform Hajj.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    According to the Shafi'i school: \"If someone offers\\n    another a free passage for Hajj, one is not obliged to\\n    accept the offer, for it is a favor and involves distress\\n    of being obliged to another person. If, however, such an\\n    offer is made by one' s son to perform Hajj, then one is\\n    obligated to do so, for one can perform it without being\\n    beholden to anyone else.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    The Hanbali school is of the view that an offer of\\n    financial help by someone else does not obligate a person\\n    to perform Hajj, nor does this classify him as\\n    (financially) capable of performing it, whether the offer\\n    comes from a stranger or a relative and whether the offer\\n    provides means of travel and provision, or linanacial\\n    help as such.\\n   </p>"

So they handed him a bucket and he drank\\n    from it.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    The scholars said: \"This hadith is one of its kind. It\\n    contains lots of valuable information.\" Al-Qadi 'Iyad\\n    said: \"Many scholars have spoken (and written) at great\\n    length about the legal injunctions contained in this\\n    hadith.\" Abu Bakr ibn Al-Mundhir has listed a large part\\n    of these identifying about one hundred and fifty\\n    injuctions. He observes that if he had analysed more\\n    closely this number would almost double.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The scholars said: This hadith indicates that for the\\n    women giving birth to a child or having monthly periods\\n    it is sunnah - and much more so for others - to take a\\n    bath when they intend to perform Hajj or 'Umrah. It also\\n    teaches us that the women who are menstruating or are\\n    still in their confinement after childbirth, should clean\\n    themselves properly, cover their private parts with a\\n    piece of cotton, then declare their ihram. It also\\n    indicates that ihram must be declared after offering\\n    either a fard or a supererogatory prayer. After declaring\\n    ihram one should utter talbiyah loudly and preferably use\\n    the same words as used by the Prophet (peace be upon\\n    him). However, there is no harm in adding similar phrases\\n    as 'Umar did: \"O Allah! I answer Your call, You Who gives\\n    blessings and good favors. I answer Your call fearing\\n    You, and wishing Your favor.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    This hadith also indicates that a pilgrim must first come\\n    to Makkah where one must perform circumambulation of\\n    arrival in Makkah (Tawaf qudoom), and touch the Black\\n    Stone--if possible--and make the first three rounds\\n    running, while making the other four walking at normal\\n    speed. The running is done around the Ka'bah except\\n    between the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone.\\n   </p><p>\\n    After making the Tawaf one must go to the Station of\\n    Ibrahim (peace be upon him) and recite the verse: \"Take\\n    the Station of Ibrahim as a place for prayer.\" Then\\n    standing there, with the Station of Ibrahim between him\\n    and the Ka'bah, he should pray two rak'ahs reciting after\\n    Al-Fatihah, Surah Al-Kafirun in the first rak'ah, and\\n    Surah Al-lkhlas in the second rak'ah. This hadith also\\n    indicates that touching the Black Stone again prior to\\n    leaving the Sacred Mosque is recommended (if possible),\\n    just as one did upon entering it. There is consensus\\n    among the scholars that touching (kissing) the Black\\n    Stone is sunnah.\\n   </p><p>\\n    After that, one must make Sa'i and for this purpose go to\\n    mount Safa. climb it, face the Ka'bah and make\\n    supplications three times to Allah. Then. one must climb\\n    down and walk toward Marwah, while jogging in the marked\\n    area called bainal milain between Safa and Marwah every\\n    time one passes this area during the seven rounds not\\n    just in the first three rounds as in Tawaf. On reaching\\n    Marwah one should climb it just as one climbed Safa, make\\n    supplications, and make remembrance.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Completion of all these rites will complete one's 'Umrah.\\n    Now one should either shave one's head or clip some of\\n    one's hair to get out of the state of ihram. This is\\n    precisely what the Companions of the Prophet (peace be\\n    upon him) did when the Prophet (peace be upon him)\\n    commanded them to change their Hajj to 'Umrah. As for the\\n    pilgrim who is combining Hajj and 'Umrah, he must not\\n    shave or clip his hair, but should remain in his state of\\n    ihram.\\n   </p><p>\\n    On the 8th of Dhul-Hij jah. those who had put off their\\n    ihram after making 'Umrah, should again put on ihra77l to\\n    perform pilgrimage, and then head to Mina with those who\\n    combine Hajj and 'Umrah. It is sunnah to offer the five\\n    daily prayers in Mina and to spend the night of the 9th\\n    of Dhul-Hijjah there.\\n   </p><p>\\n    It is also sunnah not to leave Mina for 'Arafah until\\n    after the sunrise, and not to enter 'Arafah until the sun\\n    begins to decline, and after ot'fering both Zuhr and 'Asr\\n    prayers, which the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered at\\n    Namira which is not a part of 'Arafah. The Prophet (peace\\n    be upon him) did not enter his quarters at 'Arafah until\\n    after otfering Zuhr and 'Asr prayers. Moreover, it is\\n    also sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) to offer\\n    some supererogatory (nawafil) prayers in between these\\n    two prayers.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The imam should give a sermon before the prayer, which is\\n    one of the sunnah sermons in pilgrimage. The second\\n    sermon is given by the imam on the 7th of Dhul-Hijjah\\n    after Zuhr prayer in the Ka'bah. The third of these\\n    sunnah sermons is delivered on the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah,\\n    the day of slaughtering. And the fourth sermon is given\\n    on the day the people leave (yawm an-nafr)--the 11th day\\n    of Dhul-Hijjah.\\n   </p><p>\\n    This hadith also contains some important manners and\\n    etiquette for performing Hajj and 'Umrah:\\n   </p><p>\\n    One is thereafter permitted to engage in any lawful\\n    activity that was unlawful for him while in the state of\\n    ihram, including sexual intercourse with one's wife. A\\n    person who has thrown pebbles at Jamarah al- 'Aqabah, but\\n    has not performed the circumambulation of if adah (or\\n    ziyarah) may engage in any lawful activity except sexual\\n    intercourse with his wife.\\n   </p><p>\\n    That is the guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him)\\n    concerning Hajj.

So we also\\n    declared our intention to do the same. Upon arrival in\\n    Makkah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Make your\\n    declaration of intention for 'Umrah only, except for\\n    those who have already designated their sacrificial\\n    animals, and brought them along with them.\" We made Tawaf\\n    of Ka'bah, walked seven times between Safa and Marwah.\\n    Then we consorted with our wives and wore our regular\\n    clothes. The Prophet (peace be upon him) further told us:\\n    \"Those who have garlanded (i.e., marked) their\\n    sacrificial animals, they must not break their state of\\n    ihram until the animal reaches the slaughter house to be\\n    offered in sacrifice. Then we were commanded by the\\n    Prophet (peace be upon him) to declare our intention for\\n    Hajj on the night of the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah. After\\n    completing all the rites of Hajj, we went and\\n    circumambulated around the Kabbah, walked between Safa\\n    and Marwah, and thus we completed Hajj and we offered the\\n    sacrifice as Allah says, \"If anyone wishes to continue\\n    the 'Umrah onto the Hajj, he must make an offering such\\n    as he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, he should\\n    fast three days during the Hajj and seven days on his\\n    return ... (to his country).\" (Qur'an 2.196) Offering a\\n    sheep in sacrifice is enough for this purpose. These\\n    Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) combined\\n    two worships in one year: Hajj and 'Umrah. Allah has\\n    mentioned it in His Book and (reinforced it) by the\\n    practice of His Prophet (peace be upon him), making it\\n    permissible for all people, excepting the residents of\\n    Makkah. Allah says (Qur'an 2.136): \"This is for those\\n    whose household is not in (the precincts of) the Sacred\\n    Mosque.\" The Hajj months referred to are Shawwal,\\n    Dhul-Qui'dah and DhulHijjah. So whosoever combines an\\n    'Umrah and Hajj during these months has to offer a\\n    sacrifice, or observe fast. This is reported by Bukhari.\\n   </p><p>\\n    This hadith proves that the residents of Makkah can\\n    neither perform qiran nor tamattu'. They may perform if\\n    rad only--a single Hajj or a single 'Umrah. This is the\\n    opinion of Ibn 'Abbas, and Abu Hanifah in the light of\\n    Allah' s words, \"This is for those whose household is (in\\n    the precincts of) the Sacred Mosque.\"\\n   </p><p>\\n    There is disagreement among scholars concerning \"those\\n    whose household is (in the precincts) of the Sacred\\n    Mosque.\" Malik holds that they are the people of Makkah.\\n    Al-A'raj agrees with this view and also At-Tahawi who\\n    preferred this view. Ibn 'Abbas, Taw'us, and another\\n    group are of the opinion that it is the people living\\n    within the sacred precincts of Haram, which according to\\n    Al-Hafiz, is quite apparent. Ash-Shafi'i holds that any\\n    one living around Makkah at a distance not more than that\\n    at which one is permitted to shorten regular prayers is a\\n    resident of Makkah. Ibn Jarir agrees and prefers this\\n    view. The Hanafi scholars hold that all those living\\n    within or at the miqat are residents of Makkah. In this\\n    regard, the place of residence and not the place of birth\\n    of a person is taken into account.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The above hadith also indicates that a person who\\n    performs Hajj tamattu' must first make a tawaf of Ka'bah\\n    and Sa'i between Safa and Marwah. This will suffice him\\n    for tawaful qudum (circumambulation of arrival) which is\\n    performed as a greeting to the Sacred Mosque upon arrival\\n    there. Then, after the Day of 'Arafah, such a person\\n    shall make another tawaf, tawaf ifada. and perform\\n    another Sa'i between Safa and Marwah.\\n   </p><p>\\n    As for the qarin, the pilgrim who combines 'Umrah and\\n    Hajj and remains in a state of ihram after the first\\n    'Umrah, the scholars are of the opinion that he needs to\\n    perform only one tawaf (seven circumambulations around\\n    Ka'bah) and one Sa'i (seven rounds between Safa and\\n    Marwah) for both the Hajj and 'Umrah. The case of such a\\n    person is very much similar to the pilgrim who performs\\n    ifrad (Hajj only).\\n   </p><ul><li>\\n     Jabir reported: \"The Prophet (peace be upon him)\\n     combined Hajj and 'Umrah, with one tawaf.\" This\\n     is transmitted by Tirmidhi, who considers it a\\n     sound hadith.\\n    </li><li>\\n     Ibn 'Umar reported that the Prophet (peace be\\n     upon him) said: \"He who declared his intention to\\n     perform Hajj and 'Umrah together, may perform one\\n     tawafand one Sa'i for them.\" This is reported by\\n     Tirmidhi, with the remarks that this is a hasan\\n     gharib hadith.

He must not cover his\\n    head, nor use any perfume, nor cut his hair or nails, nor\\n    engage in hunting any game, nor cut trees or grass within\\n    the Sacred Precincts of Haram.\\n   </p><p>\\n    When entering Makkah it is desirable that a pilgrim enter\\n    from its high iide. if possible. atter taking a bath at\\n    the Dhi Tawa well in Zahir. Then he should go to the Ka\\n    bah and enter the Sacred Mosque from the gate called Bab\\n    As-Salam, while uttering supplications of entry into the\\n    mosques and observing otheretiquette of entry with\\n    humility, fear, and talbiyah on his tongue.\\n   </p><p>\\n    On seeing the Ka'bah, he should raise his hands and\\n    supplicate to Allah for His bounties. Then he should\\n    directly proceed to the Black Stone, kiss it quietly or\\n    touch it with his hand and kiss the hand. If this is not\\n    possible and one cannot reach the Black Stone, one may\\n    just point toward it from a distance.\\n   </p><p>\\n    After this one should begin his tawaf around the Ka'bah\\n    supplicating in words transmitted from the Prophet (peace\\n    be upon him).\\n   </p><p>\\n    In the first three rounds it is liked that the (male)\\n    pilgrim uncover his right shoulder and jog at a slow\\n    pace. In the remaining rounds he may walk at a normal\\n    pace. It is sunnah to touch in every round the Yemeni\\n    Corner and to kiss the Black Stone. Atter completing\\n    (seven rounds of) the tawafthe pilgrim should go to the\\n    Station of Ibrahim in compliance with the command of\\n    Allah \"And take the Station of Ibrahim as a place of\\n    prayer.\" (Qur'an 2.125) There he should pray two rak'ahs\\n    of tawaf.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Now he should go to the well of Zamzam and drink of its\\n    water as much as possible. Thereafter the pilgrim goes to\\n    Al-Multazim and stands there and supplicates for himself\\n    to Allah for whatever good he may wish for in this world\\n    and the hereafter. After this he should (if possible) go\\n    to the Black Stone, and kiss it.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Then he should approach the (hill of) Safa through the\\n    As-Safa gate to begin his Sa'i in compliance with Allah's\\n    words \"Behold! Safa and Marwah are among the symbols of\\n    Allah. So if those who visit the House in the season or\\n    at other times. should compass them, it is no sin.\"\\n    (Qur'an 2.158) He should climb the Safa, look towards\\n    Ka'bah. and then make supplication to Allah, using one\\n    transmitted from the Prophet (peace be upon him). After\\n    this he should climb down and start walking toward the\\n    (hill of) Al-Marwah as a start of his seven round walk\\n    between the two hills, while remembering Allah and\\n    supplicating to Him.\\n   </p><p>\\n    On approaching one of the two green markers, he should\\n    jog to the second green marker. And after that he should\\n    resume his normal walking speed toward Al-Marwah. Upon\\n    reaching Al-Marwah he should climb it, turn toward\\n    Ka'bah, and make supplications and glorify Allah. This\\n    will complete his one round. Then he should make the\\n    remaining six rounds in like manner, completing all seven\\n    rounds.\\n   </p><p>\\n    This Sa'i is an essential (wajib) ritual of Hajj, and any\\n    pilgrim failing to perform it or a part of it must\\n    slaughter an animal to atone for this omission. Finally,\\n    if he is performing a Hajj Tamattu' (Hajj with an 'Umrah\\n    with a break between the two), he should either shave olf\\n    his head or trim his hair short. This would release him\\n    of all the restrictions of the state of ihram, and all\\n    things that were prohibited to him in that state become\\n    permissible for him, including sexual intercourse with\\n    his wife.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Those who intend to perform a Hajj Ifrad (Hajj only) or\\n    Hajj Qiran (Hajj and 'Umrah together without a break)\\n    they must continue in the state of ihram. On the 8th of\\n    Dhul-Hijjah those intending to perform Hajj Tamattu' will\\n    once more resume ihram from their residences and proceed\\n    to Mina, along with those who had continued in a state of\\n    ihram, and spend the night there.\\n   </p><p>\\n    At sunrise of the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah the pilgrims leave\\n    for Arafah, and (if possible) stay by the Mosque of\\n    Namira. There they take a bath and offer Zuhr and 'Asr\\n    prayers, making Qasr (shortening the prayers) and\\n    combining them at the earliest time behind an imam. If\\n    this is not possible then one may pray alone, as best as\\n    one can, combining and shortening the two prayers.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Pilgrims' stay at Arafah begins only atter the sun has\\n    passed its zenith. During this time one should stand by\\n    the rocks (of Arafah) or as close as possible, because\\n    this is where the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to\\n    take his stand. Staying at Arafah is the principal rite\\n    of Hajj, but climbing the Mount of Mercy is neither a\\n    sunnah nor should it be attempted.\\n   </p><p>\\n    During this stay one should face the direction of Qiblah,\\n    glorify Allah and remember Him, and supplicate to Him as\\n    much as possible until nightfall.\\n   </p><p>\\n    After nightfall the pilgrims must leave for Muzdalifah,\\n    and reaching there, offer Maghrib and 'Isha prayers,\\n    combining them and offering them toward the the end of\\n    the usual time, and then spend the night there.\\n   </p><p>\\n    At dawn the pilgrims stand by Al-Mash'ar al Haram (the\\n    Sacred Monument), and remember and glorify Allah until it\\n    is broad daylight. Thereafter they should return to Mina\\n    after picking up their pebbles from Muzdalifah.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Standing by the Sacred Monument is essential (wajib), and\\n    anyone failing to do so is required to offer a sacrifice\\n    in atonement.\\n   </p><p>\\n    After the sunrise, a pilgrim must throw seven pebbles at\\n    Jamarah Al-Aqabah. Then he should slaughter his\\n    sacrificial animal, if possible, shave off or cut his\\n    hair short. This will release him frolll the restrictions\\n    of ihram. and he may engage in any normal activity except\\n    sexual intercourse with his wite.\\n   </p><p>\\n    He must then return to Makkah to perform Tawaf Al-Itadah\\n    an essential part of Hajj, and also known as Tawaf\\n    Az-Ziyarah. He should perform it in the same manner as he\\n    had earlier performed Tawaf Al-Qudum. If the pilgrim is\\n    performing Hajj Tamattu', he must perform a Sa'i after\\n    this Tawaf Al-Ifadah. For a pilgrim performing Hajj Qiran\\n    or Ifrad, this second Sa'i is not essential, if on\\n    arriving in Makkah he had performed a Tawaf Al-Qudum.\\n   </p><p>\\n    After this tawaf - Tawaf-Al-Ifadah - a pilgrim may engage\\n    in all normal lawful activities including sexual\\n    intercourse with his wife.\\n   </p><p>\\n    The pilgrim must now return to Mina and stay overnight\\n    there. This overnight stay at Mina is essential and for\\n    abandoning it one must atone by offering a sacrifice.\\n   </p><p>\\n    After midday on the 11th of Dhul-Hijjah, the pilgrim must\\n    throw pebbles at the three Jamarahs, starting with the\\n    one nearest to Mina, then the middle one, and stand for a\\n    while invoking and supplicating to Allah. Then he should\\n    go to the last Jamarah, throw pebbles at it, and leave\\n    without stopping there. A pilgrim should finish throwing\\n    pebbles at the three Jamarahs well before the sunset. On\\n    the 12th of Dhul-Hijjah he should repeat the rites of the\\n    previous day.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Having thrown the pebbles a pilgrim is free either to\\n    return to Makkah before the sunset of the 12th of\\n    Dhul-Hijjah, or spend the 13th of Dhul-Hijjah as well in\\n    Mina, and throw pebbles at the Jamarahs.\\n   </p><p>\\n    Throwing pebbles is an essential rite of Hajj and for\\n    failing to do so one must offer a sacrifice.\\n   </p><p>\\n    After returning to Makkah if the pilgrim desires to\\n    return to his home country he must perform TawafAI-Wida'\\n    or Farewell Tawaf, which is also an essential rite of\\n    Hajj. In case he is unable to perform it, and if he has\\n    not crossed the miqat, he should return to Makkah and\\n    perform it, or else sacrifice a sheep.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In short, the essential rites of Hajj and 'Umrah are:\\n    declaring ihram from miqat, tawaf, Sa'i, halq (shaving\\n    one' s hair) or qasr (or cutting one' s hair short). With\\n    these the rituals of 'Umrah are completed.\\n   </p><p>\\n    In the case of Hajj one has to perform certain additional\\n    rites. The essential rites of Hajj are spending a Day at\\n    Arafah, throwing pebbles at Jamarahs, Tawaf Al-lfadah,\\n    staying in Mina, slaughtering an animal, shaving or\\n    cutting one's hair short. This is a brief summary of all\\n    the rites of Hajj and 'Umrah.\\n   </p>"
